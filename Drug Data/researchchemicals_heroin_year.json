{"fpery3": {"text": "Back in 2014 or 2015 I was arrested in Austin for having 2 roaches -.- and a small amount of etizolam, something similar to mescaline(can't remember chemical), and had a few tabs of 25I or some NBOMe.. Needless to say, the cops were very interested in what I had. They went after the etizolam and mescaline substance almost instantly. Believing the etizolam was cocaine(white powder) and the mescaline stuff was heroin(brown powder) lol. After nearly 25 tests nothing was coming up positive on their field tests. Last test the cop goes to the back of his car and retrieves another test kit, except this time he feels good enough to come up to me and taunt me with it and sure enough he pops the vial and it turns blue. Which is positive for cocaine I believe. Before I forget, I was asked many times what it was that I had and I always replied with, i don't know and when they asked what it was used for, I told them I tested it on rats. Lol I can still remember the cop being like, \"You know how fucking stupid that sounds.\" Hahaha... Well after two months in jail i finally get bailed out and first thing I do is call my lawyer. I begin the conversation with, \"Look, I'm sure you've heard this before but that wasn't cocaine.\" After explaining what I had the lawyer told me, \"Well if you're telling the truth, were gonna have a lot of fun with this case.\" 3 months later I had the charges dropped. But I do think I'm a part of Etizolam being outlawed in Texas. So sorry about that lol. Just thought I'd share a story of being caught with an RC.\n\nEdit: I FORGOT THE BEST PART! I just commented about it but the cop somehow got some of the mescaline stuff on his lips or something and spent a few hours in the infirmary at the jail!! \ud83e\udd23 while I was being booked I remembered them talking about how Officer Vela got into something and was in the infirmary and another officer at the jail confirmed it to me that he was tripping(as in under the influence) in there hahahaha", "author": "AnubisUndead", "score": 357, "flair": null, "created": 1585269782.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/fpery3/caught_with_etizolam/", "num_comments": 159, "title": "Caught with Etizolam", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"flkivzb": {"score": 119, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/fpery3/caught_with_etizolam/flkivzb/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1585270565.0, "body": "Why were you driving around with so much drugs in texas?

In large degree, these statements have a lot of truth, but you can\u2019t unring a bell, and I think they\u2019re coming from some people with a lot of pain from being misconceived. It isn\u2019t (that) dark if a story.\n\n\nIt\u2019s one of the most influential, life-changing experiences you can have. It\u2019s like saying you were praying in church or in deep meditation and you experienced a slice of god\u2019s profundity. You\u2019ll never be the same, why wouldn\u2019t you want your parents - who\u2019ve raised you and been a part of every major life event - to know such an emotionally epitomizing experience?\n\nEveryone would let there parents know that, if they could. Of course, I understand why people simply can\u2019t tell their parents.\n\nMy parents are relatively progressive, and when I told them I had done psychedelics, my mom made this big, exaggerated deal about how she was disappointed in me now, more than ever. I couldn\u2019t help but laugh right there and then, because it was so much emotional energy over something she has no idea and a hundred and one misconceptions about. I love my mother deeply. But I had to accept that for a while, and I realized I shouldn\u2019t have made her worry. \n\nSome hope: over time, (and with the help of her psychologist), I eventually softened her to the idea that her college-aged son had used some psychedelics and it helped him.\n\nMy point is twofold: I\u2019m actually not telling you that you should try and convince them otherwise. And yet you can\u2019t unring a bell. But as you said, you can show through time and showing gentle, patient maturity around them that it isn\u2019t as bad (and actually profoundly beneficial) as they think. Just little things, here and there, no declarations of what you know. They\u2019re probably not ready for that. You want freedom, that\u2019s all. And you haven\u2019t (actually) done anything wrong. I say this because of the whole \u2018you\u2019re going to rehab bit\u2019. I\u2019m sorry man, that\u2019s really tough and hilariously short-sighted. I hope they aren\u2019t as determined about that as they first seem. You can PM me more details if you want some guidance around it. I may be able to help, or some of the other kind redditors here\n\nJust don\u2019t expect, and don\u2019t need any quick results with that. You only need to be consistent in your beneficial actions for yourself, and through patient, emotional maturity around them. Do that, including around the rehab issue. Explain carefully and calmly why it won\u2019t help you.\n\nJust remember: you aren\u2019t totally responsible for their \u2018worry worts\u2019. It\u2019s there ignorance, not yours. Yes, we would have both taken different routes to not cause our parents pain and needless worry. But DON\u2019T beat yourself up about it. That won\u2019t help you in your quest to carefully assuage their trust and gentle, slow opening to things (even if it never looks like it does, it comes in the form of tolerance to that) over time.\n\nBut then again, as other people have said, you might be better off dropping it and pleading the fifth, and rolling with the punches, lmao. My parents have pretty open minds. It sounds like yours might be pretty rigid by today\u2019s standards. Even so, everyone is susceptible to \nEmotional maturity*time = value changes.  \n       Good luck, friend.

They obviously have a pretty closed-minded position on the topic, and you are almost certain to fail in attacking that position, at least directly.

I'm sorry to hear of that plight, it can't be any damn fun at all.\n\nI think there may be two approaches you can consider from this point.  The gentler but far more complex approach you may would be to try and nuance the conversation with the goal of salvaging the relationships, basically an indirect approach.  One way of doing that is to start by asking questions and to create a state of cognitive dissonance, where their belief and the underlying rationale of them come into conflict with reality.  Start with something along he lines of, \"So, why do you think that marijuana  and heroin are equally bad?  What facts lead you to that conclusion?\"  They will likely point to some portion of the anti-drug hysteria marketing and hype that's readily available.  Chip away at the factual bases of those, if you are willing do the research.  You are not, then, attacking them, but rather poking holes in the underpinnings of their argument.  The problem with this approach is that it takes a lot of time and effort on your part, and doesn't always work.  You might easily spend a year on this (literally) for nothing.\n\nIf you think that simply won't work, one simpler would be to lie and concoct some version of \"gosh, you're right, I won't do that any more.\"  Make it somewhat gradual and believable, then do what you wish with your life but keep quiet about your psychedelic explorations.

I literally, only ever did kratom, didn't drink, weed, anything, until, I got etizolam, but really just using it to knock myself out at night, and to stop myself from pacing/bitching for 80 minutes at a time.

I\u2019ve been clean from heroin/oxy for a while, and only taking Xanax or any benzo research chemical that I could get my hands on. \n\nI got 400 0.5mg Flubromazolam tablets and went to a McDonalds bathroom to pop them. In the past, I needed at least 20 of these tablets to feel high (my tolerance was absurd). However, I had very recently got out of rehab and had over 30 days clean, so this time I only popped 10 of the pills. \n\nI suppose it was too much. I don\u2019t remember if I took more after that, I just remember waking up in the ICU. They had a huge tube down my throat and a machine breathing for me, and I kept shitting the bed uncontrollably. I was absolutely fucked, I just couldn\u2019t believe it happened to me. I used to mix fentanyl and Xanax together all the time in high doses and never overdosed, but just 5mg of Flubromazolam was enough to make me collapse on the McDonald\u2019s floor and stop breathing. \n\nI used to think that severe respiratory depression only occurred when someone *mixed* benzos with opiates, as opposed to only taking the benzos. I was very wrong. This shit can kill you on its own, and it really doesn\u2019t take that much to do it.\n\nI was in the ICU for several days recovering from the overdose and they had me on suicide watch the whole time because they thought I was trying to kill myself taking all those pills. The cherry on top for all of this was the police finding an unmarked plastic bag with around 390 Flubromazolam tablets in my pocket. I was interviewed by the police briefly about the pills because they had no idea what they were, but luckily they didn\u2019t charge me with anything. I wondered if that was because Flubromazolam is technically legal, or because they saw that I was just a young addict and not a drug dealer.

Myself being an opiate and benzo addict can attest to the risks of combining these two drugs, your playing with your life every time you take them. I just wish they didn't feel so damn good together! I guess my point is is that there could have been a possibility of the pills not being what you thought they were, or had something else in them along with the flub? Did they say anything to you about how they stabilized you? Like if they had to use narcan or something? I'm assuming the police refused to give you back your 490!

It's crazy how fast it happens, literally overnight.  I used to stick to the 3 day rule, use for 3, sleep like shit for a night or two, but stay sober or opi free for 3 days, then go back to using for 3.  That lasted maybe a month hahaha!  I knew it was only a matter of time before I had a serious problem on my hand...\n\nI remember when I was introduced to H Halloween night about 17 yrs ago.  At the time, Hydrocodone, Oxy, Xanax, and Soma was the big thing.  I had a pretty decent Hydro and Oxy habit brewing and little did i know that my downstairs neighbors were full blown H addicts.  I was friends with them and they could tell I was pretty high while taking my dog out.  My neighbor told me stop by that night, so about an hour later, I stopped by.  His girl immediately threw my these 2 tiny black baggies that I could barely open.  Out pours this brown powder and I ask, \"Is this H?\"  Then the vinegar smell hits me!  After about 15 minutes of working the courage up, I snort the entire 10 sack.  Within 5 minutes, needless to say I knew it was GAME OVER FOR THIS GUY!  I've done a lot of euphoric drugs growing up, mainly X and Opi's to get the \"feel goods\".  Within 4 months of snorting that first line, I had that same girl start hitting me in the arm because I shook so bad.  She would say, \"give that to me, your veins are beautiful, can't hardly miss\".  The first time to inject was absolute BLISS.  Within 6 months of injecting, I was in the CLINK!

From 1948 to 1991, America was fighting the Cold War under the mandate of the Truman Doctrine, which itself was a direct result of the so called \"long telegram\" from George Kennan in 1946. This doctrine espoused the strategy of containment to stop the spread of Communism, where the US and its allies would pour money, resources, political aid and if necessary, military power into a region in order to ensure that Socialism/Communism did not spread to more countries.\n\nThis is where the terms First World, Second World and Third World come from. The \"first world\" was ostensibly the US and its Western Allies, the \"second world\" was the Eastern Bloc and its allies, and the \"third world\" was pretty much everyone else that the two sides fought over ideologically. The types of places that are a good place to foster a thriving drug trade (South East Asia, Central Asia, Central and South America) due to low employment, minimal infrastructure, government corruption and little law enforcement outside of major cities also happen to be the types of places that are ripe for revolutions.\n\nIf those revolutions happen to be Democratic and friendly to the West, or just far-right enough to be anti-Communist, then all is good and we prop up a friendly dictator, like in Chile, Argentina or Iran. If those revolutions happen to be Socialist or anti-West, well then, time to invade. If the place we invade also happens to be the major production region of a drug like coke or heroin, so be it. \n\nOf course there are numerous examples of the US actively supporting the drug trade because it was \"in Americas best interest\" (the irony is implied). Hell, while Nancy Reagan was telling kids to \"Just say no,\" her husband was basically using the CIA as a front to launder coke money to pay for weapons for the Contras to fight Communist revolutionaries. \n\nAfter the cold war, we still needed an enemy to justify our bloated military budget, so along comes the \"War of Terror\". Same script, all new countries to invade. Again, the fact that Afghanistan was the primary poppy supplier in the world when we invaded was inconsequential. For years the coalition forces vacillated between turning a blind eye to the drug trade in certain regions because it was literally the only thing bringing stability to most of the country, and burning entire fields of poppies to try to get the locals to cultivate crops less illegal.

People using drugs in an irresponsible manner, kills people. \n\nThe right to bear substances. \n\nHarm reduction as a necessity (education included).\n\n*No felons made from a simple shipment, no lives ruined* for ... e.g. \u201ckratom being treated like heroin, by volume of possession, given schedule 1 state law,\u201d *even after discharge from prison, when no one can get a job prospect due to felony record from a harmless act* (or technically *harm-reductionist act*, given responsible choice to use kratom instead of PK\u2019s, within the instance being illustrated here), *resulting in a once-never-dealing-hustler becoming a hustler on the streets, picking up a drug dealing habit*, **coz there is no other option for a fully sustainable income, regardless of how much one never wants to do such an act.***\n\nTake that passion you feel, reading your post and my comment. Hone it into inspire the ineffably altogether foreseeable process of moving in the direction of progression into a \u201cpeace on drugs\u201d approach, as an educated society, all aspects of harm reduction idealism included, moving for such good being foreseeable from insights based on all hindsight of *each and every life ruined and tax dollar wasted*, from being willing to acknowledge the issues and drive a humanistic approach with aims to guide a movement that will no longer \u201ccuff and characterize someone as a drug user,\u201d and instead: \u201clend a hand to another human being, who happened to believe substances are innately possible to bear utility without causing harm, or, utility of reducing harm (considering the \u201clegal\u201d alternative option[s], in certain circumstances) with societal programs meant to resolve and humanize people who happen to have used substances, and reform this country in a peaceful and enlightening manner that Portugal has already proven successful, absolutely. Not to mention, salvaged a lot of health and money and resources in the process of reprogramming the societal view on *potentially-addictive* or *medically-viable-alternative-to-pharma* substances (again, kratom is a communal example), by noting one thing: *it\u2019s not the drug itself; it\u2019s the relationship with the drug, that causes issues* \u2014 and it comes from just-day-no abstinence programs that inspire undue curiosity from lack of education and empathy for those who have no other means of coping, and it\u2019s worth noting: \u201cno one gets addicted to drugs \u2022just coz\u2022 they wanted to get addicted to drugs,\u201d given that is not \u201cjust cause\u201d to refrain from education and keep banning and incriminating/incarcerating.\n\nNo one deserves a stigma that penalizes them for life, for an act or behavior, that, if decriminalized, could indeed could viably be *less harmful* than alternatives they have (suicide, pure unadulterated drugs, less fentanyl in cocaine, no need for ridiculous fluorinated cannabinoids, no overly potent and powder-only forms of benzos being eyeballed from lack of education) if we *stop banning researched substances, educate the public like we do with condoms and sex-Ed, realize people will do drugs even if it\u2019s illegal, and they mean no harm, by their under-informed course leading to their use*, only in [undue dis]order of *predictably creating greater dangerous substances, resulting in chaotic disarray that comes from such behaviors as a society* \u2014 **become the change you want to see in the world, and keep the light within, to enlighten the world to the infinitely valuable nature of justifying programs to help reduce harm and induce peace, as opposed to inducing harm and reducing peace with complacency about this pervasively inane \u2018war\u2019 on drugs with no aim.**\n\n*War on drugs \u2014 is not the answer.*\n\n*Peace on humanity \u2014 is absolutely the perspective that will bring optimistic, opportunistic, prosperous, prospective change that salvages countless human lives and livelihoods, while reducing harm, in the future \u2014 never standing idly by whole watching the country as they are actively inducing harm.\u201d Keep believing, keep your attitude, and keep all viewpoints reinforcing the legitimacy of such. Lives are at stake. We must evolve. A war on drugs is senseless, when no one wins, and it just escalates, revolving. No one \u201cbeats\u201d or \u201cwins against\u201d drug prevalence in society \u2014 to believe such is foolish. So when you can\u2019t beat them, join them, and make peace within a manner that causes less harm, not to mention, reduces crime and violence associated with cartel activity, and harmful analogs being created \u2014 only due to the secrecy with which drugs must be discreetly handled, and the legislation that causes nothing but devastation. When anything harmful keeps revolving, it\u2019s time to salvage the good and start resolving.\n\nA war on drugs is a pox on the people who are being stigmatized with regard to their usage. We need an antidote, it will happen. Help drive the movement, by never letting others\u2019 shade douse your light of insight.\n\nI apologize for my egregious errors with spelling, formatting, run-on sentences, syntax, typos, or editing necessity. I can\u2019t proofread something that gets me so fired up. Need to maintain my own peaceful threshold as well, and such involves refraining from reading all I rapidly wrote without even giving a single word a second thought. Rapid fire writing. Typing on my keyboard so loud it\u2019s as if I have a vendetta against it \ud83d\ude02.\n\nWorth keeping good faith we will change the world slowly but surely, with appropriate views (not unlike what you mentioned about legislatively limiting the amounts of personal usage without penalty, like Portugal\u2019s government does, so we are humanizing people without stigmatizing or punishing them, so ignorantly, so wastefully).\n\nKeep the enlightenment fired up with good intent. Remember \u2014 this whole life \u2014- not just drug usage \u2014- is about harm reduction, sparing health, and salvaging peace, foreseeably.\n\nGod bless. Keep the love alive. Keep the humility, don\u2019t delete your post, stand by your views, justifiably and righteously thrive. \n\n(This is no \u201csoapbox for me\u201d \u2014 what this is, is another viewpoint agreeing and *screaming* about it, from *a megaphone,* on the *top of a building*, for serious nature of harm reduction and prosperity of our entire future within the view of drug stigma and policy reform, for *the valuable necessity in discussing the matter itself, and all good prospective opportunistic worth therein.* That\u2019s... what this is)\n\nKeep the voice of the enlightened truth, louder than the rest. You rock, OP. Thank you for inspiring this diatribe from me. I needed to vent, for such good logic and insight-sparing worth.

Minimum wage should always be tied to inflation - anything else makes no sense.\n\nBut considering authority I\u2018d say im quite lib, police is important, but regular police should not interfere with everyday life, and a regular officer shouldnt be able to carry anything more than a pistol.

I find a lot of people that have only used psychedelics, and those that continue to use them, they seem to justify their use of psychedelics saying \"hey atleast I'm not using meth or heroin\" that always irks me.\n\nI fully grasp the depths of reality psychedelics can drag you into, but I'd never justify my use of these drugs as being better than anything that is drugs. No drug is better than another, no matter what the perspective you hold. I wish more people understood this. Psychedelics can be mind expanding and some people use it once and never use it again because it changed their whole perspective on things, but some of those who use psychedelics once, experienced a life changing situation on it but didn't fully integrate it into their life, continue to use psychedelics (albeit responsibly) by trying to justify their use of mind altering substance saying that it isn't as bad as those other addictive drugs.\n\nYou have a point, not denying it, but the truth is there is really no reason for you to be using drugs to give you this idea. You can achieve anything and understand the whole cosmos without the use of drugs. but some of them get too involved(addicted almost) to the psychedelic experience that they repeat it over and over again, meanwhile telling themselves what they're doing is noble on pursuit. Look at it deeply and you'll see that though you aren't addicted to psychedelics, you're addicted to the experience. Most of them will deny it, but this comes back to what I said before, you don't need drugs to improve(a healthy person does not) your current state of things and no drug can teach you more than you already know. Most \"psych-heads\" never contribute positively to society, they just end up being a neusance to everyone else without realizing it.\n\nThis concept of \"blame-shifting\" is so widespread in the drug community it makes me barf. Those who smoke weed try to justify their actions by saying \"at least its not as bad as coke\", those who do coke justify their habits saying \"at least we're not heroin junkies\". Where does this end? It annoys me that within the drug community we hold such contradictary as a beliefs, I thought we were smarter.\n\nPoint I'm trying to make, no drug is better than the other Each of them serve a purpose, under the right circumstances.

I just want to share my blunder with you guys.\n\nI have been researching with increasing intensity lately. I discovered 3-ho and it hits the spot. One of the best experiences with dissos ever!\n\nI also have some old demons and I slightly lifted the lid on their box.\n\nI sometimes use the needle. Thats actually one of my old demons.\n\nWell, the other day I slowly and carefully started combining those three things.\n\nI had k in my system and didn't want to wait for it to leave before I poked myself with the h.\n\nI made sure it was a minuscule amount. Bam. woke up on the floor with a gash over my eye. Fuck. Scary as hell.\n\nBetter lay off the h. OK. lets just take a dose of 3-ho.\n\nNext thing I know, Im in a giant sack, being kidnapped. \n\nIt was made of the material that people surround trampolines with as a safety net. It was dark and I could only see bits of light from the outside.\n\nIn the sack with me were a bunch of other people. All laying quietly on the floor of this giant sack. I couldnt get out. I wanted to wake these people up, so I grabbed this bucket which I assumed was full of urine from the other folks. Who knows how long they had been in this giant sack. I dumped it all over the sleeping people.\n\nFade back to blackout.\n\nIt was morning and I was basically sobered up. My apartment was a disaster.\n\nThe stove was on and bright orange hot. There was food all over the floor. That bucket of piss turned out to be a buket of paint I had in my bedroom. Those sleeping people were piles of clothes.\n\nWhy am I telling you guys about this disaster? Therapy. I need to tell somebody how close I was to utter destruction.\n\nI am incredibly lucky nothing worse happened. I could have died more than once that night.\n\nEDIT: I will have visible reminders of this event for a long time. I have an unsightly splattering of paint on the carpet and on a lot of my clothes.

This went on for about 3 weeks where he became increasingly aggressive and hard to be around. We tried to support him but weren't able to really get through to him.\n\nAnyway the culmination of the story is that one day while he was presumably in a PCE-hole, (I could never imagine him doing anything like this otherwise) he ended up pushing his mom into a bookshelf, so she then called the cops on him. When the cops arrived at his house, he jumped at them with a knife and they shot him in the chest 3 times.\n\nSo yeah, that sucks.\n\nSo I just thought I'd put a little precaution in case anyone's thinking about going overboard with this stuff.

Love you all. Wanted to make a follow up post to my last one on the relatively unresearched synthetic opiate, AP-238\n        \nI had one intranasal session a night starting 2 weeks ago, skipping maybe 2-3 nights. I would do 10-20mg lines at a time, never exceeding 50/60mg per session. The drug itself was very chill, provided a nod that is personally preferable over fentanyl or heroin for me (no opiate addiction history or tolerance ever, just experimentation) The past 3 nights I have stopped using daily and would like to update on my nasal side effects. \n  \nTo begin, my nose would be constantly clogged and full of mucus boogers throughout the day after. Every morning I would blow my nose several times in the shower, producing disgusting looking partially solid mucus with opaque white or yellow color. On the first day of abstinence I decided to do some 2-FDCK again for the first time in several months. It was awesome, and I even unintentionally holed harder than I ever have before! It was great, but I think it made my nose even worse. Since then, whenever I blew my nose one nostril would have blood in the snot but not be continuously bleeding. \n  \nNow, after trying to blow my nose at work and clean up the mucus, it just started bleeding. And whenever I try to blow it gently or sniff too hard it starts bleeding again! Absolutely nuts side effects for not that much general substance going up the nose. I\u2019m interested to see how long it will take for my nose to return to normal. I plan to make a final report of AP-238 intranasal research once it does.\n   \nThanks for reading!", "author": "silverexe", "score": 76, "flair": null, "created": 1597226034.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/i84zi6/nosebleeds_random_stinging_and_nasal_congestion/", "num_comments": 60, "title": "Nosebleeds, random stinging, and nasal congestion from new RC opioid AP-238", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"g166rjb": {"score": 50, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i84zi6/nosebleeds_random_stinging_and_nasal_congestion/g166rjb/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597226883.0, "body": "[removed]", "replies": {"g166tuh": {"score": 10, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i84zi6/nosebleeds_random_stinging_and_nasal_congestion/g166tuh/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1597226918.0, "body": "I believe so, I\u2019m going to start experimenting with that ROA from now on.", "replies": {"g17c0xr": {"score": 7, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i84zi6/nosebleeds_random_stinging_and_nasal_congestion/g17c0xr/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597259831.0, "body": "nevermind, just plug it!", "replies": {"g17u2hy": {"score": 4, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i84zi6/nosebleeds_random_stinging_and_nasal_congestion/g17u2hy/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597271675.0, "body": "plugging burns badly", "replies": {"g19q3vu": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i84zi6/nosebleeds_random_stinging_and_nasal_congestion/g19q3vu/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597303308.0, "body": "never experienced burning, but I never took AP-238", "replies": {}}}}}}}}, "g166ztz": {"score": 17, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i84zi6/nosebleeds_random_stinging_and_nasal_congestion/g166ztz/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597227009.0, "body": "wym bruh snorting battery acid gives me a hard on", "replies": {"g185x15": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i84zi6/nosebleeds_random_stinging_and_nasal_congestion/g185x15/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597277554.0, "body": "I only boof battery acid", "replies": {}}}}, "g16m6vy": {"score": 26, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i84zi6/nosebleeds_random_stinging_and_nasal_congestion/g16m6vy/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597236068.0, "body": "God its like none of you read reports.", "replies": {"g16w35s": {"score": 29, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i84zi6/nosebleeds_random_stinging_and_nasal_congestion/g16w35s/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597244046.0, "body": "I don't know why anyone is downvoting this, they're absolutely right.

Slow taper with Diclazepam: as mentioned above. It has a longer half life and is less inebriating than Diazepam/Valium. Ashton manual protocols were followed (5-10% dosage reductions every 2-4 weeks). The reduction from a high dose to 1mg daily is easy enough without taking too much time, but the last milligram is brutal and can take years to successfully withdraw from. I unfortunately rushed my taper by opting to quit at 0.5mg only a few months into my taper. \n\n2. Flumazenil, DHM, Ibogaine, Salvia, Amentoflavone, 9-Me-BC: for the recoupling of the BZD-GABAA receptor complex and reseting your reward system via hormesis. **Important Note**: Rushing a benzo taper can ruin your reward system semi-permanently due to excess dysphoria for prolonged periods of time. There's also a chance you never recover and never resensitize no matter how long you wait. The worse your protracted withdrawals, the lower the chance there is of resensitizing fully by yourself. That's why you want to avoid bad protracted withdrawals, they really mess up your reward system to the point that you may need daily prescription amphetamines to function at all. The literature has clearly shown that heroin addicts might not die from heroin withdrawals cold turkey, but going through that can really ruin people's brains, they never get back to normal after \"toughing it out\". They develop hyperalgesia, reward deficits, and their long term prospects for overcoming the addiction is worse. Similar but different stuff happens for benzodiazepines.\n\n\n3. Cerebrolysin, Cortexin, BPC-157, TB-500, Semax, Selank, Ipamorelin + CJC1295 no DAC, GHK-Cu, Etifoxine, Emoxypine, Afobazole, Noopept, Bromantane, NSI-189, Intranasal Insulin, Magnesium L-Threonate, Agmatine, Jiaogulan @98% Gypenosides for general brain restoration, recovery and resensitization.\n\n4. Theanine, Taurine, Lemon Balm, Baicailin, Magnolia Bark, Oleamide, Nigella Sativa (Black Seed Oil), Ashwagandha (KSM-66), Progesterone (orally micronized): for general anxiolysis, mood support, and sleep enhancement.\n\nI've had over 1.5 years of experience now with protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. [It can really take multiple years for a full recovery](https://imgur.com/a/VpGwhI4), but even then [there are notable cognitive deficits 4 years after cessation of benzos according to a recent meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29244060/). \n\nOut of all the things I've tried, I would say that Imadezenil is hands down the best tool to use. I've found it to provide the most relief and efficacy, moreso than a long-acting benzo. It basically gets rid of 80% of benzo withdrawal symptoms without actually acting like a benzo (in other words, it helps withdrawals and you can use it to taper without actually using a long half-life benzo). The above background threads do a great job of explaining its mechanism of action and pharmacology, but it's basically a BZDr partial agonist that only acts on specific subreceptors of GABAA (\u03b12 for anxiolysis) and (\u03b15 for anticonvulsant properties). There's no tolerance whatsoever from what I can tell, and this makes perfect sense being a partial agonist that only targets specific GABAA subreceptors. There's no activity at \u03b11 which means there's no sedative-hypnotic effect and no amnesia/cognitive deterioration. It also acts via hormesis to recouple the BZD-GABAAr complex (similar to flumazenil but far more effective and safe from experience). I would equate 1mg Imadezenil to approximately 10mg Diazepam/Valium or 1mg Etizolam. \n\n**If I were to do my taper all over again, I'd use the following as essentials: 0.5-1.5mg Imadezenil once or twice daily sublingually for primary benzo PAWS support and tapering. Cerebrolysin, Cortexin, and BPC-157 for brain restoration and recovery. Bromantane for a dopaminergic reward system reset, NSI-189 for depression/anhedonia, and low dose Mirtazapine (<7.5mg) for sustainable sleep support for the duration of the taper.**", "author": "full_silver", "score": 91, "flair": null, "created": 1589337286.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/gihbao/imidazenil_the_fastest_way_to_recovery_benzo/", "num_comments": 53, "title": "Imidazenil - The Fastest Way to Recovery (Benzo Withdrawals)", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fqeqqqd": {"score": 17, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gihbao/imidazenil_the_fastest_way_to_recovery_benzo/fqeqqqd/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1589340837.0, "body": "You should post that in one of the benzo recovery subthreads!", "replies": {}}, "fqemntn": {"score": 7, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gihbao/imidazenil_the_fastest_way_to_recovery_benzo/fqemntn/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1589338885.0, "body": "Thank you for posting this super useful and important info!", "replies": {}}, "fqf8xgo": {"score": 5, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gihbao/imidazenil_the_fastest_way_to_recovery_benzo/fqf8xgo/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1589349495.0, "body": "Thank you so much this is extremely helpful.

I'm assuming you're already done with your taper, so Imadezenil would be pointless. I'd recommend the following protocol:\n\n1. 50mg Bromantane sublingual once daily: it boosts your natural biosynthesis of dopamine in the brain without acting as a traditional stimulant via neurotransmitter release/reuptake inhibition. It upregulates the two key enzymes responsible for dopamine biosynthesis in the brain: TH and AAAD. This absolutely needs to be your first and foremost option before resorting to daily prescription amphetamines.\n\n2. 5mL Cerebrolysin + 5mg Cortexin (dissolved together) intramuscularly once daily. This is the most powerful neuropeptide combination for overall brain restoration and recovery of various systems. It is very well studied in Russia and indicated for many neurodegenerative diseases. It is even prescribed in children. There is a ton of literature on both these compounds, take your time on Sci-Hub and read some full texts if you're willing.\n\n3. 500ug BPC-157 subcutaneously daily for the same reasons as above, but mainly acting on the dopaminergic axis.\n\n4. 40mg NSI-189 Phosphate for general depression and anhedonia.\n\n5. 7.5mg Mirtazapine sublingual every night before bed if you have insomnia or sleep quality issues.\n\n6. Last but not least, if the above don't work, then a strong KOR such a Ibogaine or Salvia can be used to reset your reward system in the case of heroin withdrawals. Anecdotes show that it works very well in past heroin addicts under the right setting (psychotherapy). This is the most invasive protocol by far in this list. This does not work as a miracle cure in the case of benzo withdrawals unfortunately.\n\n6. Worst case scenario, you can try explaining your situation to a competent physician but I doubt you'll be able to find an expert in this field who truly understands the reason you need dopaminergic stimulants. You should request low dose Vyvanse and stick with the lowest effective dose. It's the smoothest prescription stimulant and releases just the right amount of dextroamphetamine into your bloodstream every few mins irrespective of your stomach pH. You have to be willing to work with your physician and be patient with this - you'll likely get started on 20-30mg Vyvanse. Dexedrine XR Spansules are also a viable option but not as smooth pharmacokinetically as Vyvanse. I would avoid Adderall due to heavy noradrenergic side effects from levoamphetamine and would also avoid any NDRI's such as Ritalin and Wellbutrin - they do not provide the same dopaminergic push that classic dextroamphetamine provides, which is much needed in this specific scenario.", "replies": {}}}}, "fqhn7ut": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gihbao/imidazenil_the_fastest_way_to_recovery_benzo/fqhn7ut/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1589409233.0, "body": "I have it in my head that using a kappa agonist while dependent on mu agonists would precipitate withdrawal - you seem well read, can you tell me one way or the other?", "replies": {}}}}}}, "fqftsgs": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gihbao/imidazenil_the_fastest_way_to_recovery_benzo/fqftsgs/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1589360345.0, "body": "This is awesome", "replies": {}}, "g1f4rjk": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gihbao/imidazenil_the_fastest_way_to_recovery_benzo/g1f4rjk/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597419644.0, "body": "**r/Pyrazolam**", "replies": {}}, "fqgwwjq": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gihbao/imidazenil_the_fastest_way_to_recovery_benzo/fqgwwjq/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1589388764.0, "body": "I dont think its the way to go.

The \u03b11 subunit has the biggest downstream impact at the BZD receptor leading to sedation, cognitive impairment and amnesia. This is exactly what leads to long-lasting protracted withdrawals (strong \u03b11 agonists being Clonazolam, Flualprazolam, and Flunitrazolam for example).

Instead, I found Imidazenil to be far more effective as a partial agonist in the presence of a full agonist (Diazepam/Diaclazepam), where Imidazenil ends up acting a **competitive antagonist** just like Flumazenil but only negates sedation and cognitive impairment of traditional \u03b11 agonism rather than reducing seizure treshold.", "replies": {"fqh482z": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gihbao/imidazenil_the_fastest_way_to_recovery_benzo/fqh482z/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1589396053.0, "body": "The study points to the fact that a2 and a3 agonism still contributes to tolerance, but only minor.\n\nI dont know why you state that flumazenil doesnt let you get off benzos completely.

There is no sustainable GABAergic that can be used long-term without dependence and subsequent withdrawals. Even Tiagabine and Gabaxodol are not exempt from this. I would opt to use oral micronized progesterone (200mg with food before bed) as it improves sleep architecture similarly to GHB in both men and women, has minimal tolerance/dependence, and provides much needed inhibitory neurosteroids that are missing during benzo withdrawals (specifically allopregnanolone).\n\nAs far as a2 agonists, calcium and sodium channel blockers, you're better off using a truly selective drug that target what you're looking for. For blood pressure, the best antihypertensive is Nebivolol (Bystolic) under 5mg. It is ultraselective as a b1 antagonist and provides anxiolysis via winding down the adrenergic system (via modulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system). \n\nThe goal with benzo withdrawals should be to minimize protracted symptoms/interdose withdrawals, which is why a long acting benzo with 5-10% reductions every 2-4 weeks is the recommended taper approach. Unfortunately, some people still experience protracted symptoms for years due to sedative-hypnotic kindling (due to frequent daily interdose withdrawals with a short acting benzo), or by tapering too quickly and suffering through it. My goal with sharing this thread and my experience is to determine an actual strategy that promotes healing rather than masking symptoms.

At least it has for myself, not to say I have experienced what you have, especially the physical/emotional/mental abuse from your parents. That causes deep trauma, more than any other experience because they have formed your self-image in many ways. What parents tell you about yourself from a young age many times becomes repeated thoughts in your own head whether you realize it or not. \"I'm not good enough\", \"I don't deserve to be happy\" are thought patterns that develop in those situations. \n\nBut yes, I have been homeless before, I have lost the financial/emotional support of my parents after I turned 18 basically. Some of this was due to my drug use and offshoots of things that caused. But regardless, I had to fend for myself while being completely broke.

I was obsessed with pharmacology, Chemistry, basically reading about Chemistry/pharmacology all the time 24/7. I used it as a means to distract myself, so even while I was going to school for Biochemistry, I still read pharmacology for fun. I scratched and clawed my way out of this shitty hole I was in.

After I got to [350ug] , I dropped to zero no problem. I had minimal PAWS (so minimal it could have been \"reverse placebo\") for about a month and then I was completely fine.

Meaning it is hard to overdose on. The worst experience I had was an amazing supernod where I passed out and tried to start the same movie again. Then passed out again. Literally the only bad thing was missing the movie. It's probably because I mixed it with two benzos, Phenibut, and gabs. Otherwise things are great. Even that \"bad experience\" was warm and cozy. I also actually got a better nights sleep on it than I ever plan to. It has helped me cope with bipolar disorder and PTSD. I normally have at least two manic episodes a week (lasting a day) and correlated with fears of going to sleep and staying asleep. This knocks me out in only a way high dose benzos will do but without the hangover. Literally the morning after my double nod out I had the chillest experience ever at, to or through an airport.\n\nThe reason I took a high dose was because I decided not to travel with it and with tramadol instead because I didn't wanna pack a baggie and snorting scoop. I opted instead for the trams which looked very similar to my Olanzapine. It felt much dirtier and I sought out the strongest kratom extracts once I was in a legal state. It isn't that I don't have kratom at my disposal it's just that once you're at the ceiling there are bad gastrointestinal effects not true with 2map. Trams are the second treatment I've tried to be dual opiate agonists and work on seritonin.\n\n There have been trials on Tramadol and Tianeptine, and some have been successful and Tianeptine is an approved anti-depressant in several countries but never on a full scale opioid. Tramadol would probably never work in opioid doses for depression as it leads to a dirty mental fog. O-DSMT is the chem I have now and it's only slightly cleaner with a better duration.\n2map's major downfall is it's short duration. You have to redose after 3 or so hours. But the same is true with Tianeptine.\n\nThere are other benefits.\nOn 2 repeated doses of both of us taking 20mg each intranasally, NYE was a magical evening with a girl I only kinda knew. At least for that night I knew her much better and I probably owe it to this chem. \n\nAlso sex on this stuff and a small dose of amps (RC or otherwise) is great because the amps increase sensation and 2map allows you to last n last and women can have multiples during. (I believe this stuff is only a sexual enhancer for men and only when combined with amps. Women may get enhancement from this opioid as well but for them it's mostly the amps.\n\nThe 2 biggest problems with opioids are that they are fatal and how they are illegal. My first only somewhat careful experiences with this chem were very forgiving as I didn't skimp on the rest of my complex cocktail but it enhanced it in ways that were harmless. I had good conversations, was sub euphoric happy or completely euphoric with seemingly anyone and everyone. Even if I'd dosed a bit too much. So that makes this rather safe compared to other opioids. The other pesky part of opioids is the illegality of them.\n\n2-Methyl-AP-237 is federally uncontrolled and 5 state legal as it is only an analog of a Chinese cancer drug Buccinazine which is also uncontrolled.\n\nI dare say that if taken with restraint only 4 days a week that this drug should be considered an antidepressant nootropic. Much like Tianeptine. However Tianeptine WD is often worse than heroins and the WD from 2map is only as bad as morphine WD. Some food for thought is how Suboxone allows former addicts to live normal lives even while treated with subs. If 2map stays classed the way it is, people with complex mental disorders may lead more normal lives as well.\n\nNext up for hot take Monday: Etizolam when not abused is as effective as any benzo.\n\nAlso Clonazolam in low doses may combat both depression and anxiety\n\nEdit: Also no need to go onion farming. 2map, etiz gs and clam gs are incredibly easy to find clearnet!", "author": "StoopSign", "score": 7, "flair": null, "created": 1580780148.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/eyam5b/update_2methylap237_is_my_new_favorite_rc/", "num_comments": 36, "title": "Update: 2-Methyl-AP-237 is my new favorite RC", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fghd0b2": {"score": 6, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/eyam5b/update_2methylap237_is_my_new_favorite_rc/fghd0b2/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1580810898.0, "body": "Everyone says it\u2019s garbage, but I completely disagree.

I think I knew I was an addict before I was willing to admit it, and I began seeking relief in a delusional state. I remember reading all of the warnings on here about benzos, and thinking I could handle them because I had done all of the deadliest drugs without surrendering to addiction. Several years ago, there was a domestic rc vendor (that should give it away) with very fire flub, clon, and etiz at very affordable prices with reliable 2-3 day shipping in the states. This was really the epitome of domestic vendors, what a time to be on the scene if you were a benzo addict. \n\nThe first 30ml bottle of flub had me instantly addicted. I don\u2019t think I actually realized I was addicted until about 3 months in, that\u2019s how stupid I was. .5mg a day led to daily 4-8mg a day, and I proceeded to try and cold turkey myself out all the way until I checked myself into detox a year later. It went from the best year of my life, to literally the worst hell I could have imagined.\n\nYou\u2019re probably thinking, wow, this guy is a fucking idiot and deserved this. I can\u2019t say I disagree with you, but I will say I was self medicating For some very serious mental illness that I now have under control. \n\nAnyways, I did a 10 day detox and was never tapered from my habit, or ever received proper treatment. I got nothing more than the max dose of gabapentin, and some anti psychotics. I can honestly say that there were multiple points where I almost killed myself, or at least checked myself into the hospital. It has been ugly, I have tried every single supplement available, and eventually figured out what worked best: gabapentin+baclofen+lexapro (ssri). This combination gave me the most relief next to benzos, but there were still many issues, such as adhd type symptoms, and very severe mood swings. \n\nI went down this road for several years and reached a plateau, taking high doses of baclofen, Wellbutrin, 10mg lexapro, trazodone, and many supplements but I still felt paralyzed from the benzos. I have been working towards a career in IT and still suffered from memory loss to the extreme, I was risking my job until I started 20mg of memantine 3 weeks ago. \n\nMemantine works by regulating glutamate in the brain. It has very mixed reviews, and is known to not prevent regular glutamate transmission, but just to stop the irregular activity, which is why it is prescribed to people with dementia for memory loss. \n\nI did not work up to 20mg, I started immediately at 20mg because I enjoy dissociatives. I experienced a week of noticeable dissociation and brain fog, and holy fuck when the cloud disappeared did I feel my brain working. I have made more progress in the last 3 weeks than I have in the last 3 years. I have made psychological break throughs with my therapist, I have excelled at my job, I have connected with old friends and broken social barriers that were previously a seriously constraint.\n\nI am posting this because I know there are some bartards out there struggling, and feeling like there is no possible relief. I really encourage you to try some memantine to regulate your glutamate. The baclofen/lyrica/gabapentin and ssri had the greatest impact on my anxiety, but the memantine has completely changed how my brain is wired. I was about to be prescribed stimulants for adhd, and no longer need them because of this. Please take this with a grain of salt because no substance is the same for 2 people, but I know that this could help someone. My psychiatrist had no idea this was a thing and is going to be sharing it with other addicts who have struggled like me. \n\nTo the people out there who are thinking about buying rc benzos- just do it safely man. There definitely is a time and a place for benzos, but they fuck most people up and if you are self medicating for mental illness they will ruin your life. Save them for the rare trip or stim come down, just an emergency button. They fuck your brain up so bad it makes heroin addiction look like a walk in the park.

Wanted to do 40 mg. Ended up vaping 80 mg, plus 50 of diphenidine and at least 40 in 2 map 237. This stuff is more addictive than everything I have ever tried (ranging from heroin to coke to speed and I am just outnumbering the hard ones). I am not even complaining, I knew what I was putting myself into however, after this 80 mg sesh I will put it to rest for a while. Also it numbs the pain (today early in the morning I did a wrong movement while doing squat and probably ripped my tendon). After the first few puffs the pain was gone, more effective for pain relief than actual opioids. It doesn\u2019t even put too much strain on heart. I mean it is \u201conly\u201d 120 bpm and I mixed it with a lot of stuff, 25inbome makes my heart go up to 140 and DPT bad trips make my heart go up to 143. I don\u2019t feel lots of vasoconstriction and it feels relatively safe, also sert activity feels non existent... I feel motivated,primed and ready. Bonus, albeit not feeling any kind of sert acrivity I feel chatty and empathic but not in a forceful way. Wonder if this could be a replacement for PTSD patients cause there are still no evidences it can be neurotoxic. I am not even sweating that much and my temperature is as \u201clow\u201d as 37.8\u00b0C. Probably cathinones with a methylene deoxy moiety would be more suitable for PTSD patients, however the reason why MAPS sticked to MDMA is probably because MDMA doesn\u2019t give this monstrous compulsive redosing. Anyways stay safe out there, I can easily imagine people spending days sleep deprived and malnourished vaping Hex. \n\nPS it even numbed the Diphenidine manic side. More like overpowered it.

After using it semi regularly for a few days I ended up binging the rest of it one night and once it started wearing off I felt like absolute *horse shit*; my heart was racing, my nose was bleeding, and I legit thought I had overdosed and that I might die.

I'm a reasonably well respected, published scientist, and hold a PhD in my field. I've spent months bingeing on cocaine and IV heroin on numerous occasions, and I've had a troublesome relationship with alcohol for many years, but I've always been able to stop with relative ease when I'd decided enough was enough.\n\nI'm a huge fan of ketamine, but I've also been able to control my usage. With PCP analogues however, both 3-MeO-PCP and 3-HO-PCP, its another story.\n\nWith 3-MeO-PCP, I slowly ramped the dose with minimal effects and some very mild dissociation. It was severe on the nose. It burned and caused excessive rhinorrhea (runny nose), but I persisted, every evening and late into the night. Eventually one evening I dosed in the region of 20-30 mg and was overcome with mania, pulling apart a room in my house several times to find something I'd dropped. Crawling around the floor, dragging furniture around, drenched in sweat. Consumed in a frenzy, I searched and searched until I found the bulldog clip I'd dropped - something I normally wouldn't give a shit about as I have plenty more. \n\nAfter that, I knew this wasn't going anywhere good. I can't recall if I sampled it again, but then, or soon thereafter, I flushed it. Enough was enough.\n\nThen came 3-HO-PCP... WOW! This was the stuff I'd been waiting for! Again, I ramped up the dose from 4 mg until the opiate, dissociating bliss consumed me. I was in awe. It was perfect. Ideal time frame, manageable intoxication, and a miniscule dose - just a few tiny bumps was enough. I was euphoric, dissociated and delightfully stoned. I told myself I'd consume it a few days per week, but that never happened. As soon as I was an hour from the end of my work, I'd swallow a capsule, then proceed to take bumps every couple of hours til bed. The dosage grew and grew until I was averaging 12 mg with 36 mg now and again to end the night.\n\nI told myself to take a break. I told myself if I did, I would keep a little stash and enjoy it now and then. I couldn't. Everyday, evening to night I was dissociated. I was waking up exhausted. I was making spelling mistakes in emails and texts. I was forgetting things that I'd said or done, where I'd stashed my baggy, what day it was, who I'd spoken to, what work I'd done, etc. I found I was becoming more outgoing, chatting to people, becoming more enthusiastic about my plans, my thoughts, my ideas. Mania was creeping in, subtly, bit by bit. And yet I bought more (thankfully a fraction of what I'd originally planned). \n\nI began pushing it too far. People around me took notice. Combining it with the tiniest bit of alcohol or cannabis pushed me over the edge. Confusion and loss of awareness crept in. I kept burying my head in the sand, pretending (or convinced) everything was fine. Why not sample a new RC every month?! I was in control of course, and this one was going so well! Maybe I should order some more coke and ket too, maybe they'd go well with this!\n\nAs I sat at my desk, reading the same messages from friends over and over, the words made perfect sense individually, but the sentences did not. I had no idea how to formulate a response. I stared in absent confusion. I had spent weeks, maybe months, day after day in this distant state. I couldn't respond to the simplest message. Did that make sense? Was I even answering their question? What if they noticed? Did I say that already? \n\nThis happened numerous times. Hints from those close to me that my behaviour was bordering on bizzare begin to sink in - but only when heavily intoxicated. I had some very important work related responsibilities coming up, and I was running out of excuses for my behaviour, so I eventually convinced myself if I didn't do something I was going to risk it all - my life, my career, my partner, etc.\n\nSo again, I flushed the remaining stash. It's the next day. My mood has been foul and my patience short. I'm home alone for a while. I'm proud of myself. I kicked it! ...but I'm itching for a bump (or four). I pour a drink, then another. I scrape my empty baggies with a razor and manage enough for a couple of small lines. Up they go, and here I am, waiting for relief. The dissociation has lost its bliss, apart from the rare glimpse of euphoria I managed to catch again on one or two occasions. I had a tiny bit of cannabis stashed away. It'll ease my burden, I'm sure. I tear the place apart looking for it. FUCK! I must've tossed it in my confusion or one of my manic tidying sprees. \n\nSo what is it... What is it about these particular substances that just grip and don't let go? My experience could've been many times worse, and there are plenty of stories on Reddit of succumbing and facing much worse consequences. I don't know... but that is the trouble with 3-*-PCP... or at least my trouble.\n\nIt's time for a detox.

Obviously I made huge mistakes I understand that! Please don\u2019t troll! in a couple parts \nPart 1. This is for the person out there that wants to take Clonazolam either regularly or just for anxiety. \nPart 2. This is a cautionary tale for those who think they have a high tolerance to Benzos. \nPart 3. For those who have not done extensive research prior to taking this chemical.\n\nTo begin... I have suffered from anxiety issues my whole adult life and would get brief relief from Klonopin, Xanax and Valium. I have been an addict of all types of substances from heroin, Valium, meth all the way to ketamine. So I started to do research on this substance and others like it. I thought this could be a good substitute for Xanax or Klonopin. I purchased 500mg of Clonazolam in pill form. I received the package on Monday I needed to drop off my father so I waited to take it. Thinking this would take 10-15 minutes to kick in I took it after I dropped my father off and about 30 minutes from my house. I took 1 pill and 30 minutes later ended up taking 2 more (huge mistake!!!) then the next thing I remember it was Thursday morning. I woke up in my bed my wife wasn\u2019t anywhere to be found. My left eye felt like it was swollen so I walked into the bathroom and saw a giant black eye completely purple. You have to keep in mind that I have blacked out before on alcohol or mixing other drugs. I have never blacked out for 2 days str8 before! I had absolutely no regard for my life or others. From what I\u2019ve been told I was dodging traffic in the middle of the freeway. (After my wife suspected I took something and found my 100 pill stash in my backpack I became belligerent after finding out she took them) I pleaded with her that I would do anything for my pills. So she agreed to give me 2 pills if I went to detox. I said yes but never made it. The police had been called numerous times. Once after my wife convinced me to take a bath. I got naked and never made it in the bath but was apparently running through traffic naked. Long story short I will not be going down this path again because for me personally. I could have easily awakened in a jail cell with homicide charges and not remembered a thing. I believe from what my wife has said I took 6-7 pills after the initial 3 I took. I have a long ways to go about making this up to my wife and my father. (I accused my father of taking my pills) (my wife off abusing me) I was absolutely out of Control.

I first was introduced to RCs when I was around 16 and buying JWH-XXX\u2019s because they were very cheap and accessible. In retrospect I was far too young to even be consuming psychoactive chemicals, much less synthetic cannabinoids. That continued for probably about a year until I started doing opiates more frequently and by 18 I could snort 3 roxi 30\u2019s and barely get a buzz and by 19 I was a full blown iv heroin addict.\n\nFast forward 7 years through 30+ times in and out of rehabs(many times not completing them), several overdoses, iv coke/meth added in the mix, jail and we get to a year ago where I finally have myself somewhat put together and i start working on getting out of the system but have have to stop consuming cannabis and fall into a deep depression.\n\nI started falling apart quick without the cannabis and was on the verge of suicide. I know it\u2019s not great to be treating by playing doctor with drugs but I\u2019m not ready to be completely sober so I had to do something so I start researching RCs again. I find the current RC cannabinoids on the market aren\u2019t anything I want any parts of so I ordered 1cp-lsd along with some other stuff and it was truly a great decision. That was in March of this year and on my first trip I had so many deep thoughts about my life and the pain I was experiencing and what I needed to do to move forward and made so much progress in that experience that it truly may have stopped me from relapsing on heroin or killing myself because I was in such a bad place. \n\nAt the end of April my biggest fear came to reality and my grandmother, whom helped raise me for years, got Covid and had many pre existing health conditions and passed away. I\u2019m not close with much of my family so the thought of losing any of the few I am haunted me growing up. To the point of I remember being 12 and wanting to join the military at 18 so I could die as what I saw an honorable death at the time and never have to deal with losing anyone. Had this of happened in March in complete sobriety I would have went off the deep end. \n\nAbout two weeks after she passed I took 300ug of 1cp-lsd and watched The Midnight Gospel on Netflix and had one of the most introspective, emotional and therapeutic experiences of my life. Shout out to Duncan Trussell because that night changed my life.\n\nSo things were going somewhat good but with quarantine I started getting bored and got the dumb idea to dive into RC opioids. HUGE MISTAKE. I also got into some RC stims and tryptamines but I made the bad decision of slamming 2-map and o-dsmt. I got to the point where I was doing a lot and for a while and started getting bad WDs. Explored some iV stims too but found it\u2019s a dumb idea. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few weeks not since I threw away the rest of my 2map and used the rest of the o-dsmt after having a moment of clarity that by abusing RCs like I was it was no different than abusing meth/heroin and honestly probably worse and less safe. Used kratom to wein myself off and 3-fpm to help get through work. Can\u2019t say I\u2019ll never slam an RC again but I\u2019m definitely gonna do my damn best not to and not abuse them and I don\u2019t ever wanna get another opioid again. \n\nIdk why I\u2019m writing this, mostly hoping my experience will stop someone from making the same mistake I did and let people know how insidious opioids can be. And hey, I\u2019m not preaching that no one should do them because I\u2019m sure some people can use them responsibly like I can use benzos responsibility and just stop doing them whenever and not redose and blackout. Hell, I\u2019ve had a shit ton of etiz and clam laying around for like 6 months and used it once each and probably am gonna give most away and just keep a few doses of the etiz for an emergency situation. But if opioids/opiates bring you to your knees like they do me, heed my warning and if you\u2019ve never tried them before you\u2019re honestly not missing out on anything and your money is much better spend on things like lysergamides, tryptamines, mushrooms and phenethylamines.

So opiates can have very different effects on animals vs humans.  It's just this stuff has only been used on animals, so they give you the animal potency and get you excited.

The trouble is that I have yet to find any that don't make me feel ten times worse after the experience is over.\n\nStimulants are an absolute no go, as even caffeine makes me feel panicked as the effects wear off.  They feel great while I'm on them, and subsequently, it feels like the worst day of my life.\n\nPsychedelics are profoundly interesting and life changing, but the experience has grown to be full of panic and paranoia for me, such to the point that they're not enjoyable at all, and I feel at risk of trauma.  I've tried a few, but this is always the case, and it's gotten worse over time.\n\nAlcohol turns me into a different person, and one out of every two times I drink, I end up blacking out and passing out in the street or getting in a fight.  Even if this weren't the case, the hangovers are so brutal, that it's truly not worth the few hours of enjoyment before I black out.  I can't just have a few drinks, either, because I just end up very tired and very depressed, so I keep drinking more and more to run away from those feelings, and then turn into Mr. Hyde.\n\nI've not really tried dissociatives, but I have a suspicion that I'd run into the same problems I have with psychedelics.  Paranoia, doom, and a chance at trauma.\n\nMDMA is worse for me than all of these in some ways.  For an hour I'll finally feel at peace with myself, with the world, and just truly enjoy (LOVE) just being alive.  And then at the first sign of a comedown, I feel the worst feeling I've ever felt.  A deep panic, and a feeling of having all of those wonderful things I've just felt, ripppped away from me.  I've had some nasty psychedelic trips full of fear, but the feeling of the downward spike in serotonin I get as I come off of mdma, even during the roll, is the scariest thing I've felt.\n\nI use kratom very often, and it's helpful in a minor way, but it's not the mental unwind that I need, and it's quite short lived.  Kratom and etizolam can be mildly pleasant, but it's really not all that great.  As my fellow occasional recreational benzo users  who have anxiety know, they aren't really very euphoric, but just alleviate the anxiety that I have, and bring me to a baseline of feeling generally okay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know there's no such thing as the perfect drug.  But at the same time I feel doomed to not have a way to just get out of my fucking head for a few hours without suffering serious fallout.\n\nFinally, cannabis is just completely off the table.  It makes me feel awful, like everyone is against me and making fun of me, even if no one is there.  It makes me feel like I'm a fucking idiot, and I say horrible things to myself about how much of a phony I am and how fucking stupid I am.\n\nAm I missing anything?  I've thought 2cb sounds interesting, but I'm wary, since it's a psychedelic, plus I've heard the nausea and bodyload can be pretty gnarly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis post is probably pretty cringey for a lot of you, but I'm really just looking for some opinions from y'all, who usually seem very well informed and experienced in trying many things.\n\nI just want to enjoy myself from time to time, and it seems like a pretty bad hand I've been dealt if I can't have anything to just use here and there.\n\nIf it weren't for the addiction potential, I'd think heroin would probably be it, but I'm just going to avoid that possibility.  Seems better not to risk it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for any help.  I've considered taking a bit of a higher dose of benzos and then trying pot to see if it could then be kind of groovy instead of a descent into self hatred, but  I think it'd take a pretty high dose, and then I'd probably hit some pretty gnarly rebound anxiety the next day from the high dose.  Still might seem worth a try.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, thank you again for reading.  I know there's no perfect drug.  Just wanted to see if there's anything I'm not considering that might be reasonable for a person like me who's prone to a lot of anxiety.   Thank you.

Dissociatives can be pretty worthwhile but aren't as rewarding for me. I like to do small bumps of ket and play games sometimes, but not too often.\n\nI really want to say though: if the substances you mentioned in your post don't work, and cannabis is off the table to such an extent, then I don't know if using substances is the right move for you. Your story shows a surprising similarity with the story of one of my dear friends; high baseline anxiety, which in his case led to self control issues when using substances. He's off everything now, which works better for him than taking substances - even in moderation.\n\nIf you take substances regularly, IME you have a significant chance of increasing your baseline anxiety. I am not at all an anxious person, so a slight anxiety increase for me isn't that noticeable. For my friend, who is very anxious to begin with, it seemed to stand out a lot. I am also convinced this increase correlates to his occasional struggle with self control. He'd slip into abuse cycles and really lose himself, before getting better for a while.\n\nMy advice to him, and by extension to you, is to be very careful about pursuing this path. I agree with you that the occasional relaxing can be very valuable. But if it doesn't work for you with what I consider a pretty solid set of substances (kratom, cannabis, phenibut, etizolam), then perhaps it's better not to push it. Increasing the frequency or doses of substance use increases the risk of tolerance, dependency and negative effects in general. A normal schedule like you seem to be using (1x/wk kratom, 1x/wk phenibut on average) is about as far as I'm personally willing to go before I consider the risk of negative effects too big.\n\nLastly, I'd advise to maybe go a month without substances to reset all tolerances and reaffirm healthy habits. Substances are great, but having them as your only effective way of coping with life and anxiety isn't healthy and is a recipe for disaster IMO. I like to go a month sober every year (my next sober streak is due any day, probably starting in early May), and it really helps with making drugs more effective and reducing the risk of dependency and tolerance.\n\nSorry for writing a whole book.

Taking waaaay too much rc benzos everyday. Between etizolam, flualp, clonazolam, and flunitrazolam, i couldnt go more than 4 hrs without taking something. If i didnt stop i probably would of ended up dead. \n\nHeres what i did. Figure out how much of the benzos you need for a safe taper over about a month, and flush the rest. If you keep all of your shit, it will just be too much temptation. Start your taper with your normal dose, minus a little. Dont take anymore for as long as you possibly can until it becomes too unbearable. Take the dose you took earlier. Try to see how long you can go before you need to redose. Repeat this process, slightly lowering your dose each day. Do not lower your dose too quickly or else you will be too uncomfortable.\n\nJust gonna let you know, the first week or 2 is going to be absolutely awful. I did this process over about a month. Starting with 2-3 mg of flualp every 4-5 hrs for the first week, working down to 1-1.5 mg every 8 hrs by the second week, to .5mg when i wake up and go to sleep in the third week, then .1-.2 mg once a day in the fourth week. By the last week of the month, i started feeling more normal. I started only taking .1 every other day and eventually just stopped. \n\nIt is gonna be very tough and remember, going cold turkey can kill you. If you dont have the willpower to taper on your own like i just described, you need to go to a detox. I almost had a seizure during my first/second weeks multiple times. Most importantly, take your time and make sure you are comfortable and feel mostly okay. Do not rush this process you will regret it if you do.

I must admit that most of the stuff that goes through my head during my free time has little to do with chemistry, sometimes it gets a little \"colorful\" especially for a little Jewish Jersey girl like me. \\[check out my **Poetry-Dope Rhymes** section below for more details\\]\n\nThere's  something for everyone \\[interested in opioid research chemicals that is, but I will hit upon methaqualone analogues as well as benzodiazepines and have a discussion on 4-methylaminorex in my monographs\\]. Or there will be in the coming weeks and months as I have time to summarize my decade and a half long work in this arena and format these notes/commentary into my trademark-style of monographs. I try to focus on the unusual **Opioid X-Files**: mostly legal  analogues, consisting of the good, the bad, and the ugly of the lesser  known alleyways of the opioid class. Some are legitimately wonderful and euphoric. Most notable of these uniquely Duchess explorations is the revival of two old school Janssen opioids:\n\n(a) the ethyl ketone of despropionyl-beztramide (**Etodezitramide**)\n\n(b) And the highly euphoric N,N-Dimethyl analogue of dextromoramide/racemoramide known as **Dimethylmoramide.**\n\nIn my latest monograph addition I describe my experience synthesizing and commentary on the pharmacology of **phenomorphone** (N-phenethylnormoxymorphone), which is synthesized through a variety of reverse engineering N-demethylation procedures for oxymorphone, which I have dubbed ***Duchess von D-allylation***, *N-deallylation of naloxone into noroxymorphone which undergoes N-alkylation into phenomorphone*, which has a euphoric potency (not equivalent to a toxicity or analgesic potency) of fentanyl, but with more euphoric properties and an all-together different (in my opinion better) high than that of fentanyl, methadone or even heroin. Nonetheless, I find its high to be uniquely enriching and the buzz altogether wonderful.\n\nOther analogues that were less successful are still discussed and mentioned, I consider these my deformed back-alley abortion brain babies. I tend to  write without a filter, so you'll have to put up w/ a blend of my  mental abortions, usually of the coat-hanger variety: esp. *my highly  politically incorrect discourse* (which peppers my monographs throughout).

Microwaves do  serve other important purposes during the process, such as isolation  and purification steps (and for making \"Mack\" methadone free base crack  and \"Frack\" fentanyl free base crack) as well as the processing of the  intermediates.\n\nMicrowave etonitazene (***nukenitazene***)  was redeeming for its rapid access to the etonitazene molecule as well  as its utility for obtaining other analogues of the benzimidazole  scaffold. Etonitazene through conventional means \\[FI Carrol and  Coleman's 1975 EEDQ mediated synthesis\\] required a total of *9 days of reflux*.  As with the methadone nitrile synth, the scale-limitations put a  ceiling on its practicality, limiting batches to < 25 grams.\n\nUsing  a time-pulsed temp regulator (these are different from variacs)  combined with a MW that has an internal % power setting, the *clandestinist* can achieve ***Manifest Microwave Destiny***  and calibrate a consumer grade MW oven for use as an ideal laboratory  aid w/o physical modification of the microwave proper. The power output  can be estimated by taking the value provided by the manufacturer (i.e.  1000 W microwave oven) and then multiplying that by the % power setting  built-into the MW oven user interface. The best solution for the  homebake MW chemistry were the 10% and 20% settings on a 1000W MW oven.  This helps the clandestinist estimate the power range of their adapted  oven and compare it to lab-grade MW reactors and their associated  reaction wattage (which are specified in the literature).\n\nStirring  in the MW oven can also be tricky. It is best achieved by either  limiting your rxn scale so that stirring is unnecessary, or finding the  biggest baddest magnetic stirrer out there, disassembling the top  ceramic surface, and substituting the existing magnets with super  strength neodymium rare earth magnets. Those bad boys will whip that  solution like *Marquis de Sade in a Bangkok brothel.* The setup will have no problem with the *MW-stirrer double team*: churning up magnetic *cream*, while you *ream* it with a microwave *beam*.\n\nMost  of the \"magical MW effect\" mumbo jumbo (termed the non-thermal MW  effect) in the chemical literature is misleading. Most of the so-called  MW effect on rxn thermodynamics and kinetics is due to the increased  pressure resulting from conducting in a sealed vessel and the rapid  heating achieved as a result of using pressure vessels. Conducting a  reaction under pressure outside of the MW using a conventional heat  source will probably achieve the same effect, although usually quite a  bit slower. There is a Microwave Scale Disadvantage though, which is  readily apparent in the opioid syntheses that I adapted for home MW oven  use. The lack of MW interaction w/ many nonpolar organic solvents  limits the versatility. If something has the the polarity of benzene or  one of the n-hexane/pet ether solvents, you are going to have problems  getting that rxn working in the MW.  But high polarity solvents such as  water, DMF, alcohols, acetonitrile and ethers/esters/ketones, those work  splendidly...sometimes too well as their rapid heat and resulting  pressure can shatter containers. MW Explorers beware of shattered glass  in the early phases of your exploration, b/c there will be plenty. Let  the shattering begin! \\[this can be avoided by using PTFE pressure  vessels, the sweet spot being in the 50 mL range.\\]", "author": "DuchessVonD", "score": 79, "flair": null, "created": 1583854993.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/fga7un/duchess_von_ds_clandestine_rc_chemistry_monograph/", "num_comments": 19, "title": "Duchess von D's Clandestine RC Chemistry Monograph Series: von D-allylation of Naloxone to Oxymorphone - Vinyl for Your Veins: Bringing out the Narcotic in Narcan - The High-Efficiency Conversion of Naloxone into Noroxymorphone - Essential Euphoricopeia of the \u00e9galitarisme chimique: Phenomorphone", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fk3hxu9": {"score": 21, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/fga7un/duchess_von_ds_clandestine_rc_chemistry_monograph/fk3hxu9/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1583863180.0, "body": "this belongs in /r/TheeHive", "replies": {}}, "fk3izxm": {"score": 6, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/fga7un/duchess_von_ds_clandestine_rc_chemistry_monograph/fk3izxm/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1583864588.0, "body": "I've seen you on the vespiary!", "replies": {}}, "fk7xfq8": {"score": 6, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/fga7un/duchess_von_ds_clandestine_rc_chemistry_monograph/fk7xfq8/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1583974217.0, "body": "You're the coolest person on the internet.", "replies": {}}, "fk96py9": {"score": 7, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/fga7un/duchess_von_ds_clandestine_rc_chemistry_monograph/fk96py9/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1583998642.0, "body": "You are hands-down the most interesting person I've ever seen online", "replies": {"fkdfaa1": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/fga7un/duchess_von_ds_clandestine_rc_chemistry_monograph/fkdfaa1/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1584105529.0, "body": "I can fluff a lot more than pillows.\n\nIn certain cases of Viagra-resistant erectile dysfunction,\n(we're talking about the really sad cases here, such as those who watch a porn and willow)\n\nThey've successfully trialed an experimental treatment known as \"von Dillow,\" watching the Duchess take a Dilly bar and give it a sloppy swallow,\n\nIt's more effective than a little blue pill at increasing a geezer's blood flow.\n\nSometimes I'm amazed at the content matter that I'll include in the pursuit of a rhyme.

This bitch wears the pants in the relationship (I mean, metaphorically speaking, b/c obviously, they're not on right now and, btw, you can stop handhandling my ass, b/c we both know you finished with the exam long ago, and while, if i were anybody else, i'd take it as a complement that a creepy man in a lab coat is fondling my rear, you and I know its not going to make the cover of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition anytime soon, so stop), so if anyone's giving the spanking it's gonna be me.\") \n\nLater on, after I had woken up from my benzo mediated stupor, and found myself hooked up to an IV bag full of what looked like milky white syrup, which looked suspiciously like vancomycin (my father, a GI specialist had informed me of all the bad shit, like antibiotic resistant C. Diff and the like you can get from overusing powerful antibiotics such as vancomycin, which I, of course, in my OCD-like manner, misinterpreted as vancomycin = terrible persistent AB-resistant infections), so I begin removing my IV line when this black female physician (I think she was Haitian) walked in while on rounds (w/ a gaggle of students) in the middle of me freaking out. I told that bitch:\n\"Listen here you stupid Caribbean cunt, I will get fucking Hallakah Krav-Maga KKK Karate on yo' ass quicker than you can light a fucking cross on fire in your own front yard if you don't remove this shit from my arm, apologize, and tell your students over there, 'I'm a dumb bitch who uses Vancomycin too soon, Please excuse me, I'm just a simple Caribbean coon.'\" (I had kind of thought about what I was going to say ahead of time, as I was fumbling w/ my IV line and getting frustrated with how securely they had ported it in) Despite my minute stature, when I'm freaking out, I can give lucifer a run for his money and win an ice dagger staring match with Charlie Manson. Of course, the KKK would be equally liable to leave a burning cross (or would it be a burning menorah?) in my front yard, but the Doctor didn't know that. She just saw a girl with just enough piercings and (at the time) a haircut that could have walked out of central casting for American History-X, so, perhaps, she was more inclined to take my threat seriously.\n\nAnyway, that was almost a decade ago at the peak of my less stable period...so, where was I?...oh yeah: in addition to my laissez faire attitude toward patient safety, my own emotional stability (at times), and my tendency to be a very difficult patient, and a whole bunch of other things that are blatantly obvious, it's probably a good thing that I don't have patients...or children.\n\nLove,\n\n--The Duchess\n\n(or The Douchess, cuz I was sort of douche to the poor Haitian doc, which I genuinely felt bad about later.

(when I need a doc I need to wait on my doc, but when they want to talk to you any doc will do). I told the doc what happened, I assured her I'm not on drugs or trying to kill myself, I just want to take my medicine and go home to mourn, but she kept saying she doesn't believe me, that I have to be high even tho she couldn't tell what I took. I looked different but definitely not high, so I got pissed off told her to fuck herself for fucking with me on a day like this, what kind a bitch she is and slammed the doors... On the way out a friend met me and I told him what happened and he convinced me to go back. And you know what? They lowered my dose from 90-60mg. Thats 30%. It's fucking illegal. And when I asked my doc why can they lower my dose for 30mg when I just want my medicine and go home they first of all fuck with me, then decide to make me suffer after being butthurt and my doc said that was a mistake and that it wasn't her call and all kinds of excuses....\n\nI told her please lower my dose or I'll make a scene, I'll start hanging around the clinic and harassing people so you'll have to lower it. So lower the dose before I do something stupid and we're all in deep shit. You for running a clinic the way you do (what u mean) u know exactly what I mean. I'm surprised it's the only clinic in the whole country where they make up rules, give u different dose everyday and if you want to see what they're doing they tell u to fuck off politely.. Other clinics measure out the dose infront of you and mix it with juice. To top it all my clinic uses the cheapest brand of methadone which should be administered twice a day, but they rather give doses up to 180mg.

I originally used loperamide to help me after my doctor took me off gabapentin when I was abusing it, and I couldn't sleep or think at all without it. I was abusing it heavily, getting two prescriptions from two doctors a month. Given that, it was a recipe for disaster with someone with an addiction problem.\n\nWhen the second doctor took me off, I was looking online for literally anything I could have help and nothing illegal because I was on probation (I did and have been smoking marijuana throughout all of this, it never helped and it was very strong, it was probably sativa). I came across a few posts mentioning loperamide (an anti-diarrhea medicine) as a last measure means for withdrawal from mainly heroin or methadone and the like. I was desperate enough because I really did feel like I was going insane, so I ended up finding some and took about 20mg to test it. I don't know if I felt it at all but I do think I slept a little bit that night. \n\nThe next few days I didn't take anything besides a new 10mg/12hrs propranolol prescription for the withdrawal. It wasn't helping so I decided since I wasn't allergic to the loperamide, I would up the dose and see one last time if it would actually work. I ended up taking about 50 pills so 100mg, and I didn't feel it at all. At least at first... It felt pretty heavy in my stomach, but I gave it a few hours because one post said it would take a while to feel anything. What I felt in the next 4-5 hours later could only be described as pure bliss, akin to how oxy would feel if it was a little less euphoric (still a lot), along with it lasting a whole 2 days. There is the initial rush for about 3-4 hours, then the next couple days is just a steady high and I nod a ton during this. \n\nI'm just writing all of this to give you context, now my questions are\n\nA: Is it better to continue using loperamide or go to O-DSMT?\n\nB: If it's better, is it worth searching for a vendor or is it rare to find?\n\nThanks so much in advance!", "author": "Blowing_Snow", "score": 4, "flair": null, "created": 1588241279.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/gamww2/odsmt_question/", "num_comments": 14, "title": "O-DSMT Question", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fp0pc5d": {"score": 8, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gamww2/odsmt_question/fp0pc5d/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1588242785.0, "body": "If you feel like you need some opioid don't go to O-DSMT and for sure get off the lope.

If you do not have a tolerance, \\*\\*DO NOT USE MY REPORT AS YOUR BASIS.\\*\\*  Seriously, apparently it's easily strong at \\~20mg orally with no tolerance\n\n\\- During report, notes with no substance indicator is indicative of 2-methyl-237\n\nempty stomach, no bupe for the day\n\n\\- 2:00pm: allergy test of 5mg oral.  No perceived effects whatsoever\n\n\\- 2:30pm: 58mg oral.  10min- mild stimulation, stomach warmth, enjoying my vidya.  36min- still mild, eyeliids a bit heavy, but still playing vidya well.  50min- more noticeable, but still low\n\n\\- 3:30pm: 30mg insufflated.  Mild burn, attribute this to already being on substance 3min- neck pain subsides (bad posture). 23min- really enjoying the music of my vidya.\n\n\\- 4:10pm: 10mg insufflated.  Not really a noticeable change, eat some crackers and read\n\n\\- 6:58pm: 140mg (baseline by this point).  Much more pronounced feeling after about 30min, lasts roughly 60-90min (again, not much notetaking)\n\n\\- Getting ready for work, I dose 409mg adrafinil and 1mg pyrazolam at 942pm (DANGEROUS TO MIX BENZOS AND OPIOIDS, seriously be smart.  Using 2-6mg pyraz throughout each day weeks before today), again back to baseline by this point.  I've also had a large lunch, future entries will reflect this\n\n\\- 12:30am: dose 150mg.  Takes \\~ 90min to kick in, and it's quite a nice high (again, large lunch prior to work).  High lasts just over an hour\n\n\\- 7am: dose 180mg and 3mg pyrazolam.  Only small snacks before between now and last instance.  Come up takes \\~40min but definitely enjoying the combination.  Not playing vidya well (likely the pyraz), but the high is nice and lasts until about 9:56am\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClosing thoughts:\n\n\\- I can see why people have referenced this the \"crack\" of opioid RCs.  The high doesn't last long and the urge to redose can be strong.  Fortunately, my discipline has improved over the years, and I've started the bupe again today w/ plans to not redose for at least a week (no precipitated W/Ds btw, pretty sure the half-life is similar to 2MAP237.\n\n\\- Overall, I used 573mg in one evening.  Those with opiate tolerances, be tolerant of the fact that you can go through this VERY quickly.\n\n\\- I will only ever take this orally from hereon.  I've heard how caustic this is, and I don't want to harm my butthole either lol.  The burn through insufflation was noticeable even after already feeling effects too\n\n\\- It seems having a large meal prior to this greatly increases the time it takes to kick in.  It is still short lived however once it does start.\n\n\\- For me personally, I won't be taking this in combination with benzo RCs as I like to remain functional.  Aside from what I take for anxiety, I'm personally not looking for a blackout high experience\n\n\\- I hope this helps people with high tolerances looking into 2methyl237.  I will not be using this throwaway often, but feel free to ask questions and I'll try to answer them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading =\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: According to my [first inquiry here](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/hjknbf/how_is_redosing_2methyl237_throughout_the_day/), I actually ate just before 6:30pm, so before the log at 6:58pm.  I think that still contributed to the time it took me to feel the dose at 12:30am, but I find it interesting that it didn't seem to affect my 6:58 dose that much.. maybe because my body hadn't fully digested?  Again, wasn't intending on making an experience report, but it definitely contributed to the long comeup a few hours later\n\nEdit2: pm --> am", "author": "DefinitelyAnAlt420", "score": 9, "flair": null, "created": 1593789060.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/hkel16/experience_report_2methyl237_high_opiod_tolerance/", "num_comments": 13, "title": "Experience Report: 2-methyl-237 (high opiod tolerance, evening of July 2, 2020)", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fwsd2oh": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/hkel16/experience_report_2methyl237_high_opiod_tolerance/fwsd2oh/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1593794204.0, "body": "Well written.

Librium is a decent mild older benzo that's FDA approved but not good if you have a high tolerance. A couple of drugs that are not actually benzodiazpines but work on gaba receptors are Gabapentin... it's actually a very good drug for anxiety around 700-900mg(500 or 600 are still helpful) when combined with Suboxone.

As soon as you take benzos daily for even a short period of time, then you: (A) are addicted; (B) have built a tolerance that renders the medication effectively useless; and (C) are at risk of hellish withdrawl symptoms unless you can perform a successful taper, which requires a lot of time, careful attention to detail, significant willpower, and precise dose measuring (which is essentially impossible for people taking pills\u2014I dose volumetrically). \n\nI wish the cultural attitude toward benzos changed to be something you take once or twice a week, with zero ramping up of frequency or dose-size.

I won\u2019t lie, I was a little scared of this chemical based on what I had heard in reviews (causticity, nausea), but I decided to give it a go anyways. \n\nI have done a few opioids before, all in the last couple of months or so. These experiences were with 15mg of Hydrocodone on three different occasions all taken orally, .3mg of Buprenorphine plugged (not combined with nalaxone), and, on maybe 3 or 4 different occasions, a combo of 250-500mg Phenibut FAA insuffuted and 3-4 grams of Kratom taken orally. My tolerance for trying all of these chemicals, including trying 2map, has been very low or nonexistent. \n\nI had heard 2map has a similar potency to morphine, and because 15mg of Hydrocodone was great for me and had a similar potency, I decided to try 16mg of 2map. I mixed 80mg of 2map into 5ml of distilled water, then drew it up into 5, 1cc oral syringes. \n\nWhen the time came for my first dose, I poured out a small glass of distilled water after eating a medium sized meal to reduce nausea. Into the glass of distilled water, 1cc (16mg 2map) of solution was added. I drank the glass of water, and it had a distinct taste, similar to the smell, which was like a mix of cheese and gasoline, the taste only lingered for a few seconds, and wasn\u2019t particularly unpleasant. Much better than the taste of Kratom.\n\nWithin 10 minutes of ingestion, I felt the usual opiate warmth, and significant euphoria and sedation. For an equal dose of Hydrocodone, I would say 2map has twice the amount of sedation, with maybe 5-7x more euphoria. It was also slightly itchy. The effects continued to climb in intensity for another 30 minutes, and then began to decline until I was at baseline just over 2 hours after dosing. My first experience with 2map was much stronger and euphoric than I expected by a very large amount. I would imagine that\u2019s what heroin would feel like, and hearing other people compare it to medium quality H definitely makes sense.\n\nMy second dose of 2map occurred two nights later, and this time 1 drank 1.5cc (24mg 2map) of solution, and then redosed with 1cc (16mg 2map) of solution an hour and a half later. The effects were very similar to the first time, only more intense, and more nod-friendly. Redosing was very nice and smooth, and the very fast come up time makes for an amazing experience. Music was enjoyable as well which is nice because on some opioids it becomes annoying. I\u2019ve heard some people say it is stimulating, but I didn\u2019t experience any stimulation at all really. Buprenorphine was much more stimulating.\n\nOverall, this chemical is wayyy better than any other opioid high I\u2019ve ever experienced, and I can see why people have compared it to heroin. I experienced no discomfort or nausea taking it orally as long as I ate with it or drank a glass of milk with it. It completely blows Hydrocodone, Buprenorphine, and Kratom+Phenibut out of the water for me, so if you don\u2019t have much of a tolerance, this is an amazing, cheap opioid to buy.", "author": "SibeliusVC", "score": 10, "flair": null, "created": 1592548990.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/hboqm4/2methylap237_was_miles_ahead_of_any_other_opioid/", "num_comments": 12, "title": "2-Methyl-AP-237 was miles ahead of any other opioid I\u2019ve tried (Report)", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fva9yvl": {"score": 23, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/hboqm4/2methylap237_was_miles_ahead_of_any_other_opioid/fva9yvl/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1592552763.0, "body": "Best opioid you tried and the hardest one you\u2019ve done is subs?

I did not experience anything for the first 15 minutes, which was strange, and had me thinking maybe I didn't do enough - but that's not the case with this chemical, it just take's a second to set-in, trust me on this one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, I have no exp. with 3meopcp prior to this, or anything like it - only things like DxM, you know, cough syrup, or RoBoCouGH, and also something called 2fdck - which I found to be really really interesting!\n\nThe 3-MeO-PcP is pretty good stuff, and it is very VERY potent!\n\nI cant stress that enough, like, you literally only need 5-6mg of this stuff to get really tanked, however, I find myself doing 5-6mg (insufflated) then another 5-6mg a few hours later (the 2nd dose really hits me hard as fuck); I have not yet tried oral, only insufflated, although I did very sloppily put 6-7mg on some tinfoil and tried smoking it - which I have no idea if it worked, because I had already consumed around 15-20mg nasally prior to this - so I can't attest to it's effects vaped on tin-foil yet, but i am curious about other user-experience with this CH3M - this seems to be a really interesting chemical to research and I am really surprised at how potent it actually is...coming from someone who' has never touched PCP, but has done other hard drugs like meth, cocaine, heroin, etc.\n\ni used to be an addict,, injecting methamphetamine and heroin on a daily basis, was addicted to that stuff for years but got clean and no longer use needles, so I am not a noob - but this stuff, its something else, and i would love to hear more about it from others and have more information on the subject, so please feel free to share your experiences with this substance on this post here for others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really didn't think this out or through before posting, and I am under the influence of 3meopcp at the time of this text, so take that into account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do find this substance to be very stimulating, and it make's my body and brain feel like it's vibrating when consumed, typically in the 10mg insufflated dosage range, I have not yet tried any other ROA other than nasal, but I do plan to try oral soon and will post some info on that.\n\nAm just really surprised at how many different ROA's (routes of administration) there are for this one, I mean, you can vape it in e-liquid, you can snort it, you can slam it, you can take it orally, you can even sublingually dose it (I think?) - I have free-based cocaine before, like put the coke powder on tin foil and mixed a little bit of baking soda with it then put a few droplets of water and mixed it around with my finger, in circles on the sheet of foil  - which then I let dry and used a lighter and tooter to smoke/vape it - I don't think you have to use baking soda with 3meopcp, I think u can just put it on foil and vape it - but I tried with little info/research on that and cant really report on that just yet...but.. i do plan on putting some info out there for others interested in the future, because it is possible and it does work from what I hear.\n\nso yeah, 3-MeO-PcP - it's a very strong dissociative-like substance, and I don't know much about it, but I do want to know more and know if others have user-experience with it, and what its been like for them, that's why I am creating this post  - so if you have any exp. with 3-meo-pcp, please do share - even if its random or just words, anything helps because the more info out there on it the more we can benefit from using this CH3M safely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I find 10mg insufflated to be really really strong, I don't know that I will ever go over that because it almost immobilizes you at that point, the body load the mental space is just too strong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading, and I am looking forward to hearing what others have to say about this one!\n\n\\- \n\nB", "author": "InfoJunkie88", "score": 6, "flair": null, "created": 1601622536.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/j3jgp1/3meopcp_beginners_guidefirsttimersexperience/", "num_comments": 9, "title": "3-MeO-PcP Beginners Guide....First-Timers-Experience...", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"g7cpgor": {"score": 5, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/j3jgp1/3meopcp_beginners_guidefirsttimersexperience/g7cpgor/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1601630176.0, "body": "I feel that sort of vibration and weird stimulation too.

Its best to mix with K i recommend lowering your K dose by 30-50 percent and add 20mg then do it all at once .better antidepressant than K. too\n\nhere are my disso stat comparison\n\n3-ho-pcp:  \nRelaxing/warm: 7/10\n\nMania inducing:6/10\n\nPsychedelia,Holes, Visuals: 0/10  the only time I had visuals was when I took too much and was seeing teleporting aliens in the corner of my eye. That was like 30 mg so not a good drug for holes \n\nRecreation:9/10 \n\nAntidepression: 0/10  \ndespite what people claim I find this drug has none of the antidepressent qualities you see in PCM and PCE derivitives. Yes if your depressed and you take it you'll feel good and still feel good after but its nothing like K and I would not recommend you try this for depression. \n\n3hopcp would make me extremely emotionally unstable afterwards. Like crying and stuff spazzing out.\n\n3-meo-pcp: Relaxing/warm -1/10\n\nMania Inducing: 5/10\n\nPsychedelia,Holes, Visuals: 3/10- dont try it  \n\nRecreation:3/10 - Was extremely boring i just felt retarded and numb. I got no good effects and kept upping my doses trying to figure out a good dose for me. I got up to 40 mg and blacked out. In my blackout i mustve thrown the bag away since I haven't found it since. \n\nAntidepression: 0/10   same as 3hopcp\n\n\n3-meo-pce:   warmth  10/10 This shit was magical dude. \n\nMania inducing: 7/10 - this ones pretty good at inducing mania but its a different type than the 3hopcp type. \n\nPsychedelia, Holes, Visuals: 10/10:  Probably the strongest ive ever tripped on Dissos(that i can rememeber) Ok so this substance has a really unique hole. You feel like your underwater felt kind of like the Pepsi man commercial. It's got a magical feeling to it a bit like DXM but more positive. Most dissos you hole on them and it's pretty detached you know what I mean? Oh and about the underwater thing. I really felt like I was in the bottom of the ocean. one time my song i was playing ended and so for the next song they need to take you to a new scenario. I was listening to this song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iz1vrjX3Ls and they put me into a tube. Think of those tubes at the bank where you can deposit checks. It's like that but on the astral plane. Forgot to mention the tube was full of a kind of watery gel that felt really nice as i shot through.  https://imgur.com/a/TajYEEz Heres a chatlog I found between me and my friend when I was having this experience.\n\nRecreation: 10/10 Just dont over do it   \n\n\nDCK: WARMTH 3/10\n \npsychedelia: 10/10\n  \nRecreation: 3/10 \n\nAntidepression 10/10 SS+\n\n\nMania: 4/10 \n(dont do it over multiple days it aint K it seems to retain some of the stimulating effects from the PCxs)  \nAlso forgot to mention DCK gave me xray vision . I'm if it was real or if it's just my mind remembers my room and puts the pieces together.\nI get this effect even when I dont use it(ran out in marchish?) \nYeah the other day i was laying in my bed listening to lil peep sad af  and smoking a cigarete and put my blindfolds on bam xray vision again. \n(btw this cigarete is what made me manic tbh I'm not even 21 I was like gimme a a loosie bro. And so he hands It over i pass over a dollar and beforeI give him  money the other one this guy who actually speaks inglish ask for my id so i put the money down on the counter and ran off with the cigs) I actually feel kind of bad about this even tho ive shoplifted a bunch of beer in my life  and never paid. Maybe its cause this guy seemed sad and disrepected that i ran off even tho i paid. I'm sorry arab guy.) had to get it off my chest \n \n\n\n2fdck: Bought this twice each time and it never worked for me snorted 300mg and didnt feel anything.   \n\n\n\nDXM: \npsychedelia: 7/10 \n\nRecreation: 9/10 \n\nAntidepression: 7/10 (It's a different kind to K tho) \n\n\nMania: 10/10 The worst i've ever been in my life When I was using 3hopcp everyday I was actually depressed af . IDK why the pcps have such a reputation and not DXM.  redose dxm 3 days in a row(one time per day) led to me having a severe manic episode where I'm suprised I didnt get instutionalized or arrested.   \n \n\n\nK: Psychedelia 9/10\n\nrecreation: 10/10 - For me this drug is like heroin to an opiate addict. No other drug has given me such a good experience. AND theres almost no downside to it? I think the bladder thing is overblown and probably from Snorting user? I only use it IM and I've used it very heavy for long periods of time and never had any problems besides a little burn while I pee and more need to pee. (ive been doing K often for over a year) \n\nAntidepression 10/10 The antidepressent effect is not as much as DCK but I prefer K's subtle effect \n\nMania:1/10  Extremely difficult to make your self manic with this one.\n\n^will forever be my fav disco", "author": "madison259", "score": 17, "flair": null, "created": 1588290081.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/gay11p/my_review_of_dck_and_comparison_to_other_dissos/", "num_comments": 8, "title": "My review of DCK and comparison to other dissos. jarbrains?, xray vision and a limo ride with satan.

Discovered etizolam when I was 15, would do 100mg in a month, binging on weekends with my neighborhood friend, every 3-6 months, until I was 17, my most recent order of 125 2mg 'Etizolam Stars' (if you know you know) was taken by the police. Told him it was an anxiety supplement that I got online, like stuff over the counter. Wasn't charged.\n  \nCue 1st half of 2017, when I for the first time in my life became addicted to any one substance. Alprazolam, and selling Xanax to fuel my addiction. This period consisted of daily maintenance doses of alp (2-3mg a day average), along with a plethora of other drugs out of curiosity (different benzos, opiates, meth, Adderall, DXM, MDMA; pique polysubstance abused coupled with Xanax addiction).\n  \nForced to go-to rehab and had my 18th birthday in there. When I got out, I knew I'd never go back to being physically dependent on anything. And 2.5 years later, I'm still not. Had some stints in 2018 with trying new drugs and my life revolving around getting fucked up (heroin, cocaine, xans on the weekends), but still never addicted physically. That heroin is no joke though. Besides the point anyway.\n  \n-------- \n  \nCue to present day. Been keeping my benzo use infrequent, once a week or less for over a year. It seems like I have some sort of permanent tolerance even though I'm not addicted. Back in the day I used to take 0.25-0.5mg Alprazolam at once and feel perfectly medicated. Well due to my drug use taking a toll on my mental state it seems like it's always a struggle to ward off my social anxiety and inability to be in the moment with drugs. When I'm alone, I feel at peace. But I was invited to a party, and last weekend, I bailed because I wasn't feeling up for it. Just would rather stay in my studio and hang with close friends and chill. We ended up drinking and doing coke anyway. Hadn't done coke in months, so that was nice. \n  \nTo the point of the post. Fluaplrazolam 3mg + 4 beers report. I showed up to the party at 10:30pm, having just dosed my first ever dose of Fluaplrazolam; 0.5mg. I was still uncomfortable and anxious in the environment so I got a beer. Took another half 0.5mg and beer. Still lucid as hell and wishing I was more fluid for the party. I love parties when I'm on benzos and can get that real lubrication from the alcohol. By the end of the night, most others had left, and it was just me my best friend and a few girls that were talking with us. We hang out in the main room for a while, probably my favorite part of the party. I was feeling a bit better after my 4th beer. \n  \nEveryone departed, and I was about to get picked up by my studio partner when I saw my best bro outside waiting on a ride and he asked me if I'm trying to go to this next party. I was dissolving a full 1mg Fluaplrazolam tab sublingually at this point, planning on vegetating in the studio after a seemingly failed attempt to party. I was like oh shit, fuck yeah let's go. Started feeling the full tab nicely. We got to this next party and it was bonkers. People in the lawn, some dude telling us it's overpacked and we can't get in. Well he ran off somewhere so we went inside. It was lit as hell at this party, they had a subwoofer and sound system playing good party music, and it was fucking packed. I was feeling great for this environment, off of total 2mg Fluaplrazolam and 4 beers. \n  \nDanced around and shit, talked to some people, generally was able to get my level at this point. Cops showed up and I was the first one to jump the backyard fence (underage drinking charge is a no-no, currently have court for probation violation) Caught an Uber with my friend and went back to my studio. Took another Fluaplrazolam blotter and went a little manic, recording a new song idea and touching up some of our mixes for our next album. Went to sleep real easily. \n  \nWoke up feeling like garbage but now I'm okay, few hours after wake up. I'm making this post to help out some people who are confused about these 'superbenzos'. First off, if you have no past experience with benzo abuse and addiction, no shit, these drugs will knock you on your ass. Secondly if you're the type to get sleepy or use benzos as sleep aid, Fluaplrazolam will probably not be good for you as a social anxiety aid. Personally, I loosen up on benzos, and get a lot of energy because my mental fog is alleviated and I feel like I can do everything I always want to do but don't.  \n  \nAand lastly. Blotters VS Solution. Blotters are simply underdosed. It isn't the same as LSD blotters, they can retain dosage a bit more consistently. I could literally feel the dried up chemical on the blotter when I was taking it. So most likely, I only took about 2-2.5mg. I recommend the blotters if you can get them because you know exactly how much you've taken, you can split off however many you want to use in a night really conveniently, and keep track of your dosing by simply counting how many you have left instead of guessing how much fluid is missing from a bottle. \n  \nP.S. - Obligatory don't combine benzos and alcohol. Combining two strong central nervous depressants have high possibility of being fatal in higher doses or bad circumstances.\n  \nThanks for reading.", "author": "silverexe", "score": 21, "flair": null, "created": 1581304719.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/f1dh24/fluaplrazolam_sensible_experience_report/", "num_comments": 6, "title": "Fluaplrazolam | Sensible Experience Report", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fh4l6lk": {"score": 9, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/f1dh24/fluaplrazolam_sensible_experience_report/fh4l6lk/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1581308465.0, "body": "A great report thanks for writing it .", "replies": {}}, "fh4mdsp": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/f1dh24/fluaplrazolam_sensible_experience_report/fh4mdsp/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1581308862.0, "body": "Just for the permanent tolerance part.

I get it. This isn\u2019t the same situation but people that understand chemical compounds might cringe at this idea as well. I know this isn\u2019t a \u201cclassic speed ball dude\u201d but instead a psychedelic phenethylamine and dissociative mix.  Go cry about it elsewhere. I\u2019ve seen people mixing heroin and meth and being in pure bliss, and I recently got a huge experimental bundle for fun, so I thought hey what the hell might as well.. Couldn\u2019t find anything online, and I don\u2019t trust everything I read online anyways. So take this all with a grain of salt \ud83d\ude09 Anyways .. Not sure of the proper format or wording, just for harm reduction purposes of warning people of the combination. \n\nPre-Trip: Took both orally in a capsule. Weighed on a milligram scale (going to the thousandths place). Triple/quadruple checked to make sure the amounts were correct. Checked weighing an empty capsule and rechecked the filled capsules after taring and recalibrating. Multiple times. \n\nAmounts: About 35mg 3-ho-pce and 20mg 2C-B-FLY\n\nTrip report: after 1 hour and I start feeling the 3-ho-pce, then I took 20mg of 2C-B-FLY\nI\u2019ve never been allergic to any drugs (so far) and I don\u2019t believe the symptoms were anything to do with that. \nA couple of hours in: at times I had to be reminding myself to breathe normally.. I felt like my heart was barely pumping. It felt similar to a time I mixed a strong upper and downer, a long time ago. Heart palpitations (sort of, but not exactly like that) to an extent? Such a weird feeling I can\u2019t explain.. but the whole time I was just hoping it ends soon. Waste of a night and at times I felt like I should induce vomiting, somehow, but hadn\u2019t eaten much beforehand so it didn\u2019t seem feasible and thought I\u2019d rather just lay down and let it pass.. \nThe visual effects were minimal. Small color distortions, but even that felt like a gloomy weirdly tint/shade of purple all around with no fun exciting visual tone behind it. \n\nEnding last words: Some of you might think I just don\u2019t enjoy these kinds of drugs but you couldn\u2019t be more wrong, I had the time of my life on 400ug 1P-LSD and 45mg metocin (4-HO-MET) a month prior. \n***Keep in mind - everyone\u2019s experiences will vary.
