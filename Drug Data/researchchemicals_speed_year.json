I did a lot of other drugs many different ways because of this, but I was never addicted to anything other than cannabis and nicotine. \n\nI wasn't trying to be productive, so no I was not productive. \nNo unique skills. The only thing my experimentation with hard drugs got me was the ability to save my judgement. \nBefore, junkies were bad. Now, I regard addicts as human beings who are in pain, suffering, and often times doing their best despite poverty and trauma. \n\n\nI think this did more for me than learning a skill might have. I kind of left that attitude (try everything twice) behind after doing hallucinogens recreationally for awhile, and then ceremonially.

And when you quit both, their withdrawals partially cancel each other out.\n* and if that wasn't enough, antipsychotics exert, overly simplified, the opposite effect of monoaminergic stimulants. with excpetion of Histamine receptors (which makes them addtionally effective for sleep), they block almost all receptors to some degree that monoaminergic stims work on (inderectly of course), hence antipsychotic tolerance roughly equals less stim tolerance and vica versa, means it reverses tolerance to stims to a certain degree.\n\nI take amphs every day, sort of therapeutically but also recreationally (i'm never really tweaking or something, but take enough to lift my mood etc.). i use sero for sleep every night at about 50-75 and it's working perfect. i sleep 8 hours almost everyday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ncons:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* if you are antipsychotic-naive, it can be toguh to figure out the right dose. too much and you risk getting akathisia for like 3, which is bad. very bad. always start with 50 mg and see if it's enough. 75 is the sweet spot for me for sustainable usage.\n* also, it's quite long lasting and has an active metabolite, so, especially without tolerance, taking too much may make you feel groggy the next day and dimnish the effects of stimulants for another few hours. but they still cancel any negative feeling of the stimulant hangovers the next day. at the right dose, and especially if your brain gets used to it, there isn't much of a hangover from either at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nmore shit that helps with comedowns (like really helps, not like fucking 5htp or cbd or some shit)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* kratom the next day. works wonders, but is also habit forming.\n* take antioxidants (vit c < opc < egcg <NAC < emoxipine) togther with stims.\n* consume acidic food or supps (NAC and vit c happen to be pretty acidic too) when you want to come down. this will increase amphetamine/basic drugs excretion.\n* supps like magnesium and multivitamins and all that shit\n* FUCKING.

I have a naturally high tolerance to them, and can handle rather unhealthy amounts of them. For reference a single 30mg adderall taken intranasally doesn't feel that strong to me, and will mostly have the effect of making me crave more. For me the lines blur between \"functional\" and \"recreational\" when it comes to amphetamines, which is why I love them so. I enjoy the fact that I can be very high and experiencing significant euphoria, while also still being able to socialize, complete tasks, and pass as sober to society at large. I fell in love with prescription amphetamine pretty much instantly, so the prospect of an RC that is far cheaper, easily available, and just as good (or even almost as good) was very appealing. As a result I have taken many of them. I will be comparing them to amphetamine mostly, so you can consider that the \"control\" to for all these RCs. I take something for the comedown anytime I take a stimulant. I often also take these long before I come down to smooth it out. My go to is phenibut, but I also use and have used kratom, hydrocodone, 1,4-BDO, CBD, and some RC benzos for this purpose. I have pretty rough comedowns because I tend to take a lot, and I also redose to stay high for a whole day when I take stims. I also wait at least a week between my \"speed days\" and at most I allow myself to take them two days in a row, never more. So I typically am going into the experience with either no tolerance or a rather low tolerance. My habits of usage certainly play a role in how the drugs affect me, so keep that in mind. I will rank each one at the end of its review.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2-FA:** This one is by far the closest RC to Amphetamine in my experience. A 30mg oral dose of 2-FA nearly the same as a 30mg Adderall IR to me, as far as mood lift, stimulation, and side effects. The duration is pretty similar as well. I think Amphetamine is capable of inducing somewhat more euphoria at higher doses, but the difference is rather small. 2-FA still has good euphoria if the proper dose is taken, but its ability as a consistent mood booster is as good as standard amphetamine. In my seasoned opinion, this is the gold standard of functional RC stims, and it is good enough to totally replace expensive RX stims. I think that 2-FA may have a slightly milder comedown compared against the control, but like most of it's qualities it's far more similar than it is different. Great mood boost and stimulation without being too distracting. It is everything that I thought 2-FMA would be, which is an Adderall clone. It is pretty terrible to snort, and it doesn't vape. This one is best oral, but also works very well plugged. I don't have a ton to say about this one, because it's very similar to amphetamine in every regard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2-FMA:** This one was a huge disappointment for me. I was really just hoping it would be even half as good as RX amphetamines, but it just wasn't. People were right when they said it is very functional and has low abuse potential, but that's only because it lacks any significant mood boost/euphoria. Everything was there, the strong stimulation, the focus, muscle tension, the long duration, everything except the enjoyment. It feels like amphetamine with all the pleasure stripped away. It didn't necessarily make me feel bad, but I didn't feel good either. It basically made me feel apathetic and robotic. Even if I was very awake and could focus, I didn't really give a shit about anything. For me amphetamine is useful not just because it helps me focus, but because it gives me a fantastic mood that makes tasks so much more interesting and engaging. Therefore, making me productive. For this reason, 2-FMA was pretty much useless for me. Feeling like a robot who is only compelled to do things by joyless stimulation kind of sucks.\n\nThe only application I could imagine for this drug would be in combinations with other drugs that are enjoyable on their own, but would benefit from a bit of stimulation. At least the potency and duration were rather high. This is by far my least favorite RC amphetamine, it actually really confuses me that people recommend this drug so much, but perhaps I'm to fixated on pleasure to appreciate this as the tool that it is to some people. An amphetamine without pleasure is like an opiod that dulls pain but doesn't have euphoria, what's the point?  At one point, I put some in a bowl of weed, and I think it worked partially. I refuse to get this one again to give a proper vape trial as I would have to pay for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3-FMA:** This one is weird. It honestly does feel somewhat like a midway point between 2-FMA and 4-FMA. The first thing that I noticed about it was how potent it is. I vaporized 30 milligrams, and it felt like I was just coming up on 60mgs of adderall. I found it to be significantly more potent and longer lasting than amphetamine, especially when taken orally. It is also unique in the fact that it vapes nicely. It is pretty euphoric as well, in the ballpark of adderall, maybe a little more intense. When I get really high on speed I get to a point where it's difficult to not rapidly form ideas, either by talking to people, writing, or just basically forming a complex dialogue in my own head. I get to that state VERY QUICKLY with this stuff. It's weird because it can serve the role of a functional drug well enough, but it's definitely not ideal for it. It just skips the stage of being pleasantly stimulated and focused, and goes straight to what is basically a state of controlled mania.\n\nI'm not sure if it does have any effect on serotonin, but if it does it certainly releases far less then 4-FMA. It also seems to be a little on the edgier side, it caused jitteryness and a feeling of over stimulation more than its peers. In general, I think the amphetamines with a methyl group tend to be a little more potent, but are also a little heavier in the undesirable side effects. I found myself needing a little kratom or phenibut to smooth this one out. This one isn't my favorite, but its impressive potency and duration give you a lot of bang for your buck. The fact that you can vape it is also very nice. The powder was mostly small rocks, and it smelled really chemically in an unpleasant way, so I assumed it would be nasty. However, upon vaping it off foil I realized that it had a very mild taste, kind of like a fake sweetener, and didn't burn my lungs at all. It vaporizes even a little bit better than 3-FPM, at least for the batch I got. This one is worth giving a try for amphetamine lovers who enjoy being perhaps a little too blasted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4-FMA:** This one is really rather euphoric. It definitely releases some serotonin, but not enough to make it a proper empathogen. It also releases to much to really be a functional stimulant either. This one is kind of just in a stimulant limbo. On one occasion, I did take it at work in a succession of smaller doses. It got me through my shift with no sleep, but it took a toll on me. It's very good for socializing, especially informally with friends, but it's a little too rolly to be good for focusing or studying. It's also not even as complete of a roll as say 3-MMC. I found that it was a little less potent than amphetamine, and also had a worse comedown. In general, it seems to be a bit harsher on the body and mind, probably in part due to serotonin release. It's not really a terrible drug, it's just right in-between two roles, neither of which it can satisfactorily fulfill. This one would probably be best for recreational activities where you want plenty of euphoria and stimulation without dedicating to an actual roll. It's not the worse stimulant I've tried for sure, but if you've got other options go with those.  It seems like this is just a shittier version of 4-FA, a drug that was able to fit into two roles far better. The second worse one I've tried.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3-FEA:** This is the only one in this list that I would consider to be a true empathogen. This is possibly the most unique amphetamine that I have tried, because it is by far the least stimulating. When you take an empathogen like MDMA, there is some level of relaxation mixed with the stimulation due to the serotonin release. It's pretty subtle with a drug like MDMA, but its like 3-FEA takes that kind of serotoninergic chill, and presents it in its pure form, without the in your face stimulation. It almost seems as if it's amphetamine, but with most of the dopamine and norepinephrine replaced by serotonin. It's the only amphetamine I have taken that didn't compel me to constantly move. The dosages for this one were very high, but even at very high doses there wasn't a whole lot of muscle tension or stimulation. At a certain dose level (I don't remember what it was, but it was high) it did become a true roll in my opinion, just the most relaxing roll ever. It actually was a little trippy at that point. Unlike 4-FMA, where even when you took a lot you never felt like you were even close to rolling. The weird part was that at doses below the threshold of rolling, it was literally just a relaxing amphetamine. It felt like speed, just instead of that pushy energetic rush, there was a calm sense of well being and chill. I felt more social, but instead of it being driven by stimulation it was driven by a feeling of openness and calm.\n\nDue to its rolly nature, this one is probably not good to take as frequently as standard amphetamines, but it is really nice and worth trying. Some people characterized this drug as being a useless in-between like 4-FMA, but it's far more interesting and fun than that. I personally found the comedown to be a lot more tolerable than drugs like 6-APB or MDMA. It was about as bad as an amphetamine comedown, just different. Instead of acute mental and physical discomfort, it took the form of a gradual transition out of the high and into a feeling similar to how you feel about a day after a strong MDMA roll, emotionally drained. This drug is super unique, if you like entactogens this one is worth trying, if nothing else but for the novelty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3-FPM:** I know this isn't technically an amphetamine, but it's pretty similar and it's got a flourine on it. Plus I want to talk about this one. This is one of two stimulants I have vaped. Because of this, it is elevated to a higher status for me. Especially since this drug is fucking painful to sniff, even more so than most of the previously mentioned drugs; all of which, besides pharma amphetamine, are pretty awful to snort. I think what I like the most about 3-FPM is that is has less unpleasant side effects than any other drug on this list overall. I can sleep more quickly, eat more easily, clench my jaw less, and have considerably more tolerable comedowns. One might assume that this is a trade off for euphoria, but I disagree (sort of). For me, 3-FPM can have euphoria as good as amphetamine, it just doesn't last as long. It has a short window of real pleasure, and then the majority of the rest of the high is just okay. Oral amphetamine has 3 to 4 hours of the actually really good peak effects, where 3-FPM has one, even though I feel like the total duration of 3-FPM is roughly the same. As a result of this, it lends itself to continual dosing, which is why vaporization is my favorite ROA for this one. It's really easy to just vape a bit of it every half hour or so and just keep a nice high going. It's strange though. You want to redose to get back the euphoria, but you don't actually start coming down until a few hours after you start craving. So it can be insanely fiendish, but if you're occupied you can kind of just ignore it for a little bit, as opposed to something like coke.\n\nIt's also far less potent that amphetamine, probably about half as strong. The lower potency combined with the extremely forgiving nature of this stim means that even when you're using a ridiculous amount of the stuff during a binge it never fucks with you as much as you feel like it should. For these reasons, it's a pretty good functional drug (as long as you're using ROA's other than vaped), second to 2-FA as far as RCs go for me, but it's also a pretty decent recreational drug. It's super fun to vape a ton of it with some friends because you can enjoy that satisfaction of overindulgence without paying the price that less friendly stims will charge (shit like hexen for example). I have a feeling that 3-FPM has far less of an effect on adrenaline than most amphetamines, while still releasing a good amount of dopamine. The high is really smooth and clean and doesn't have much edginess to it. It's not like a serotonergic kind of smoothness either, it's like a purified dopamine high. This one is one of my favorite stims, simply because it's so light, yet it still has that nice energetic euphoria. I blow through this drug so quickly when I have it though. It's ironic that the lightest stim on this list is also the most compulsive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis list has all of the ones I've tried so far. I know this list is missing 3-FA, 4-FA, and 4-FEA. I would love to try the first two, although it wouldn't surprise me if 4-FA is pretty much extinct to Americans. From what I hear, 4-FEA is an even less potent version of 3-FEA, which sounds pretty useless, so I doubt I'll try it. I hope someone can get something of value from this 3-FMA fueled monstrosity, my apologies for this wall o' text.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited for grammar and sanity.", "author": "colorfulexistance", "score": 257, "flair": null, "created": 1583235805.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/fcone5/my_reviews_on_all_of_the_flourinated_amphetamines/", "num_comments": 111, "title": "My Reviews On All of The Flourinated Amphetamines I've Tried", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fjc3rrp": {"score": 45, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/fcone5/my_reviews_on_all_of_the_flourinated_amphetamines/fjc3rrp/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1583236662.0, "body": "Good read.

Makes you look and act like a crackhead tho. Super compulsive AND super addictive, probably the one drug that makes me think about it a bit too concerningly often. \n\nSurprisingly little to no comedown too. \n\n**4F-MPH:** It's everything about ritalin but turned 120% up. Currently on it for the first time. Slaps.\n\n**Methylphenidate:** Amazing stim, gives me smooth euphoria throughout the day. Sometimes makes me tweak a bit but it's great for anything productive while being fun as shit. \n\nDoesn't make me feel like im high on drugs, just makes me a better and happier me. Its expensive though and the comedown **sucks** so i don't use it often. \n\nDefinitely something i should watch out with 4f though, its cheap asf and easy to get in large amounts. \n\n**Caffeine:** been addicted to this since i was 13 lol. If i take a 2 week tolerance break it literally gives me euphoria. Isn't unhealthy. It's socially acceptable. Makes me function very well. It's not something too special but it has a place in my heart. \n\nAlso coffee in most forms tastes delicious. \n\n**Armodafinil/modafinil:** used it for a while to be productive. It worked well. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\nHas no comedown and feels healthier than other stims so I'm ranking it higher. \n\n**Methamphetamine:** Did it once so i don't have much to say here. Good euphoria but a whole week of comedown + those redose cravings is no bueno for me. \n\n**Amphetamine:** Makes me feel great if its good but most street speed is cut to hell and gives me a lot of anxiety. If it's pharma adderall, i like it a lot. Not much experience with it though. If i got access to pharmacy stims I'm going for the ritalin \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\n**2-FMA:** Pretty nice stim, has a little bit of euphoria and makes me productive. Nearly no comedown. It gives me more anxiety than i want and my heart rate JUMPS waaaaay more than other stims. Feels really unhealthy in that regard. \n\n**1-ethyl-theobromine:** Synthesised with a friend of mine from theobromine as a fun lil experiment. Used a caffeine synth but replaced the methyl iodide with ethyl iodide. Worked well and had a melting point matching the literature. \n\nI took some. Felt like a really strong coffee. Lasted shorter. Was a nice lil experience. Uh. That's all. \n\n**_From here onwards they're all garbage imo_**\n\n**Flmodafinil:** It's a lot like modafinil but makes me an anxious mess. I'll pass. \n\n**Theobromine:** eating a bar of dark chocolate for breakfast after a coffee tolerance break just made me unable to sleep with no other discernible effects. The definition of meh. \n\n**Theacrine:** useless, no effects. \n\n**IPPH:** made me feel like shit and annoyed at everything. No stimulation, no anything else. Just annoying edgyness.

Ketamine has shown incredible antidepressant results and I think in the next few years it will probably become the first-line response to someone being hospitalized for suicidal intentions. Benzodiazepines are used now but they can actually make people more likely to commit suicide by removing their anxiety about going through with it.

This is rather a newer understanding from what I gather. Amphetamines entering synaptic vesicles through VMAT-2 collapse the pH gradient between cytosol and synaptic vesicle which allows monoamines to exit the synaptic vesicle into the cytosol. (More availability for efflux caused by TAAR-1).\n\nMonoamine transporters themselves (DAT, SERT, and NET themselves rather than VMAT) are co-localized with TAAR-1 receptors throughout the brain, and when amphetamines are taken up through monoamine transporters they activate TAAR-1 causing transporter phosphorylation which reverses the transporter and causes efflux of the relevant associated monoamine. (Of which more are available from VMAT)\n\nObviously this effect will be more pronounced at dopaminergic neurons, as the affinity for uptake through DAT is higher than SERT, unless dopamine or norepinephrine transporters are co-localalized with SERT. I don't have extensive knowledge of how often this occurs but I know there are instances of DA/5-HT co-localalization.\n\nI'm no biochemist but all of this taken together seems to me to suggest a potential for a non-negligible effect (1.7 mM isn't strong but it isn't nothing).\n\nYou could be correct, and maybe the differences have more to do with increased cAMP through TAAR-1 activation. I had kind of forgot that TAAR-1 was inside the terminal and thus needs to actually be taken through the relevant transporter to act as a releasing agent rather than just indiscriminately blasting all monoamines.\n\nAlso just a side note, I understand TAAR's association with amphetamine is a relatively recent understanding (last decade or so) of amphetamines' MOA, whereas previously it was thought that it was simple competitive reuptake inhibition via the fact that amphetamines had affinity for DAT/NET. That might be why you hadn't heard it discussed in this context previously.

If you have only 3MMC as reference point then the taking 4MMC won't all of a sudden make (quality) 3MMC totally worthless as many people seem to suggest (not you, you've phrased it suggestive in a positive way) But many times i see no mention of the fact that even though 4MMC have significant better euphoria, it comes with it downsides as well for the SERT affinity. So I might agree that 3MMC is even a better 'stimulant' then 4MMC which i feel belongs under the pure entactogens. Personally there both far to recreational to be of any productive kind for me, but 3MMC has imo a little stronger aphrodisiac effects and much less of a sudden crash. Which in turn makes it a lot less fiendish then 4MMC... again in my opionion.\nBut all that being said: quality 4MMC is an amazing compound\n\n2. Not everybody has easy access to REAL and quality 4MMC these days since its pretty much global ban. So if you get it test it to be sure, as many times people get sold other cathinones or mixes there off being sold as 4MMC (65:35 3mmc/4emc is a common example i find) furthermore it depends where you live of course.. in my county the Netherlands its still readily available as is 4FA. But 100km south when in Belgium i have only ever run in to fake mixes (just as an example, nothing against Belgium)\n\nTo OP: great post, you've clearly found 4f-MPH which is a great substance.

From 1948 to 1991, America was fighting the Cold War under the mandate of the Truman Doctrine, which itself was a direct result of the so called \"long telegram\" from George Kennan in 1946. This doctrine espoused the strategy of containment to stop the spread of Communism, where the US and its allies would pour money, resources, political aid and if necessary, military power into a region in order to ensure that Socialism/Communism did not spread to more countries.\n\nThis is where the terms First World, Second World and Third World come from. The \"first world\" was ostensibly the US and its Western Allies, the \"second world\" was the Eastern Bloc and its allies, and the \"third world\" was pretty much everyone else that the two sides fought over ideologically. The types of places that are a good place to foster a thriving drug trade (South East Asia, Central Asia, Central and South America) due to low employment, minimal infrastructure, government corruption and little law enforcement outside of major cities also happen to be the types of places that are ripe for revolutions.\n\nIf those revolutions happen to be Democratic and friendly to the West, or just far-right enough to be anti-Communist, then all is good and we prop up a friendly dictator, like in Chile, Argentina or Iran. If those revolutions happen to be Socialist or anti-West, well then, time to invade. If the place we invade also happens to be the major production region of a drug like coke or heroin, so be it. \n\nOf course there are numerous examples of the US actively supporting the drug trade because it was \"in Americas best interest\" (the irony is implied). Hell, while Nancy Reagan was telling kids to \"Just say no,\" her husband was basically using the CIA as a front to launder coke money to pay for weapons for the Contras to fight Communist revolutionaries. \n\nAfter the cold war, we still needed an enemy to justify our bloated military budget, so along comes the \"War of Terror\". Same script, all new countries to invade. Again, the fact that Afghanistan was the primary poppy supplier in the world when we invaded was inconsequential. For years the coalition forces vacillated between turning a blind eye to the drug trade in certain regions because it was literally the only thing bringing stability to most of the country, and burning entire fields of poppies to try to get the locals to cultivate crops less illegal.

Not to mention, so much less lives ruined, so much less tax money spent on prisons, so much harm reduction, so much communal exposure to help guide and reinforce truth of harm reduction education efforts. \n\nHonestly, check it out. If you want the details (down to the amounts everyone is allowed to carry on them for personal use, for each drug), feel free to ask me. \n\nIt is shocking, it is groundbreaking, it is ... worth adopting, everywhere, for the good of salvaging baseline even approach in humanity\u2019s \u201cpeace on drugs\u201d productive efforts, as opposed to the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d cycle that unjustifiably produces bans within a manner precisely accurate to what you describe, here.\n\nI feel you, bud. I don\u2019t like the stigma around drugs. \n\nThere are no bad drugs or good drugs, \n\nthere are no hard drugs or soft drugs.\n\nThere is, however, a paradigm we should all find relatably worth noting: *there are good* ***relationships*** *with drugs, and bad* ***relationships*** *with drugs*.\n\nPeace, fam. I feel you. Keep the love alive. Starve the ego, feed the soul. Consider making your passion the fuel for the inevitable future trajectory of harm reduction movements, once everyone as a society is willing to stop looking the other direction, and catches on to these issues...to these aspects of drugs, to these aspects of human nature, to these aspects of the relationship dynamics within & between drugs and human nature.\n\nDrugs don\u2019t kill people. People with drugs don\u2019t kill people. People using drugs in an irresponsible manner, kills people. \n\nThe right to bear substances. \n\nHarm reduction as a necessity (education included).\n\n*No felons made from a simple shipment, no lives ruined* for ... e.g. \u201ckratom being treated like heroin, by volume of possession, given schedule 1 state law,\u201d *even after discharge from prison, when no one can get a job prospect due to felony record from a harmless act* (or technically *harm-reductionist act*, given responsible choice to use kratom instead of PK\u2019s, within the instance being illustrated here), *resulting in a once-never-dealing-hustler becoming a hustler on the streets, picking up a drug dealing habit*, **coz there is no other option for a fully sustainable income, regardless of how much one never wants to do such an act.***\n\nTake that passion you feel, reading your post and my comment. Hone it into inspire the ineffably altogether foreseeable process of moving in the direction of progression into a \u201cpeace on drugs\u201d approach, as an educated society, all aspects of harm reduction idealism included, moving for such good being foreseeable from insights based on all hindsight of *each and every life ruined and tax dollar wasted*, from being willing to acknowledge the issues and drive a humanistic approach with aims to guide a movement that will no longer \u201ccuff and characterize someone as a drug user,\u201d and instead: \u201clend a hand to another human being, who happened to believe substances are innately possible to bear utility without causing harm, or, utility of reducing harm (considering the \u201clegal\u201d alternative option[s], in certain circumstances) with societal programs meant to resolve and humanize people who happen to have used substances, and reform this country in a peaceful and enlightening manner that Portugal has already proven successful, absolutely. Not to mention, salvaged a lot of health and money and resources in the process of reprogramming the societal view on *potentially-addictive* or *medically-viable-alternative-to-pharma* substances (again, kratom is a communal example), by noting one thing: *it\u2019s not the drug itself; it\u2019s the relationship with the drug, that causes issues* \u2014 and it comes from just-day-no abstinence programs that inspire undue curiosity from lack of education and empathy for those who have no other means of coping, and it\u2019s worth noting: \u201cno one gets addicted to drugs \u2022just coz\u2022 they wanted to get addicted to drugs,\u201d given that is not \u201cjust cause\u201d to refrain from education and keep banning and incriminating/incarcerating.\n\nNo one deserves a stigma that penalizes them for life, for an act or behavior, that, if decriminalized, could indeed could viably be *less harmful* than alternatives they have (suicide, pure unadulterated drugs, less fentanyl in cocaine, no need for ridiculous fluorinated cannabinoids, no overly potent and powder-only forms of benzos being eyeballed from lack of education) if we *stop banning researched substances, educate the public like we do with condoms and sex-Ed, realize people will do drugs even if it\u2019s illegal, and they mean no harm, by their under-informed course leading to their use*, only in [undue dis]order of *predictably creating greater dangerous substances, resulting in chaotic disarray that comes from such behaviors as a society* \u2014 **become the change you want to see in the world, and keep the light within, to enlighten the world to the infinitely valuable nature of justifying programs to help reduce harm and induce peace, as opposed to inducing harm and reducing peace with complacency about this pervasively inane \u2018war\u2019 on drugs with no aim.**\n\n*War on drugs \u2014 is not the answer.*\n\n*Peace on humanity \u2014 is absolutely the perspective that will bring optimistic, opportunistic, prosperous, prospective change that salvages countless human lives and livelihoods, while reducing harm, in the future \u2014 never standing idly by whole watching the country as they are actively inducing harm.\u201d Keep believing, keep your attitude, and keep all viewpoints reinforcing the legitimacy of such. Lives are at stake. We must evolve. A war on drugs is senseless, when no one wins, and it just escalates, revolving. No one \u201cbeats\u201d or \u201cwins against\u201d drug prevalence in society \u2014 to believe such is foolish. So when you can\u2019t beat them, join them, and make peace within a manner that causes less harm, not to mention, reduces crime and violence associated with cartel activity, and harmful analogs being created \u2014 only due to the secrecy with which drugs must be discreetly handled, and the legislation that causes nothing but devastation. When anything harmful keeps revolving, it\u2019s time to salvage the good and start resolving.\n\nA war on drugs is a pox on the people who are being stigmatized with regard to their usage. We need an antidote, it will happen. Help drive the movement, by never letting others\u2019 shade douse your light of insight.\n\nI apologize for my egregious errors with spelling, formatting, run-on sentences, syntax, typos, or editing necessity. I can\u2019t proofread something that gets me so fired up. Need to maintain my own peaceful threshold as well, and such involves refraining from reading all I rapidly wrote without even giving a single word a second thought. Rapid fire writing. Typing on my keyboard so loud it\u2019s as if I have a vendetta against it \ud83d\ude02.\n\nWorth keeping good faith we will change the world slowly but surely, with appropriate views (not unlike what you mentioned about legislatively limiting the amounts of personal usage without penalty, like Portugal\u2019s government does, so we are humanizing people without stigmatizing or punishing them, so ignorantly, so wastefully).\n\nKeep the enlightenment fired up with good intent. Remember \u2014 this whole life \u2014- not just drug usage \u2014- is about harm reduction, sparing health, and salvaging peace, foreseeably.\n\nGod bless. Keep the love alive. Keep the humility, don\u2019t delete your post, stand by your views, justifiably and righteously thrive. \n\n(This is no \u201csoapbox for me\u201d \u2014 what this is, is another viewpoint agreeing and *screaming* about it, from *a megaphone,* on the *top of a building*, for serious nature of harm reduction and prosperity of our entire future within the view of drug stigma and policy reform, for *the valuable necessity in discussing the matter itself, and all good prospective opportunistic worth therein.* That\u2019s... what this is)\n\nKeep the voice of the enlightened truth, louder than the rest. You rock, OP. Thank you for inspiring this diatribe from me. I needed to vent, for such good logic and insight-sparing worth. We all should, within reasonable views, with proven fact (Portugal!) of what will work to keep our world intact, without harshness of solely opinion when we all ...react.

Minimum wage should always be tied to inflation - anything else makes no sense.\n\nBut considering authority I\u2018d say im quite lib, police is important, but regular police should not interfere with everyday life, and a regular officer shouldnt be able to carry anything more than a pistol.

Fact is the way you guys are are treating drugs is TOO liberal, and everyone will have problems with them at some point.. because no matter how good your mental power is, drugs can override your normal thoughts patterns, and before you realize it you are an addict or developed a severe health issue to something you possibly touted as safe for years. For example, all it takes for a casual for-fun user/every now and then type, is some bad shit to go down in life that takes you to a low where you feel like nothing can help you feel better, so you do the only thing you\u2019ve taught yourself to feel better which is drugs. This creates a nasty cycle of denial and addiction. Brings up another fact, is that you all seem to disregard the fact that most drug users have mental health issues to go along with their use.

The come up was strong but nothing too out of the ordinary just some body load and eye fluttering which I normally only get when rolling. I ended up going with my gf (gf is sober) to drive us to chili\u2019s to pick up some food and then swing by a smoke shop to pick up some nitros chargers. \nOnce we got back to the apartment I was approximately 2 hours into the trip and decided to take a whippet. This is where I experienced my first delusion that was the catalyst for the psychosis episode. When I took the whippet I said something along the lines of \u201cthe demon is back\u201d to which my girlfriend looked completely shocked which in my delusional brain at this point concluded that her reaction to me saying what I said was confirmation that something demonic really just happened. I then proceeded to say what\u2019s going on and stormed out of the apartment. \nAs I stormed out of my apartment I started to realize I did have control over my body and actions so maybe I wasn\u2019t possessed but instead of using any sort of reasoning skills I started have 4-5 other delusions. The delusions consisted of me living in a simulated world, me having something to do with a spiritual battle going on, me believing that I was Jesus suffering for humanity\u2019s sins and so on. \nI ended up running all the way to my mothers house (which was a couple blocks away)-because I needed to explain to her how reality had just broken because of the demonic possession and or other delusions but once I got to her house (my childhood house) it literally looked like a haunted house that was oozing black smoke which I interpreted as evil.\n\nI then ran away from my moms house after knocking on the door and standing in her front yard, putting my arms into a cross like position. So I\u2019m running away from my moms house at this point but she gets in her van and comes after me and pulls up to a stop sign and asks me to get in the van while crying. What I saw was her van oozing black smoke and her face looked like she was possessed and trying to manipulate me to get in the van I ran full speed away from her van while screaming \u201cThis goes against everything you have ever taught me!!\u201d. At this point I actually hopped a 9ft fence into someone\u2019s back yard and started just sprinting through people\u2019s front and backyards trying to follow what I could see as light rather then the darknesss that I saw from my moms house and van. \nThe light eventually lead me to a house where I thought I was going to meet god maybe in the form of my own mother but that did not happen. So I actually just sat on the porch of this house while I observed my visuals which looked like spirits fighting each other. I eventually left the house and started running down the street again at this point I heard someone running behind me. Turns out my gf had called my best friend to come help me out so I hear his voice behind me. He is the first person I have seen up close since the psychosis episode had occurred so when I saw him I tried scanning his face to see if I could see if he looked possessed or like he was trying to take me down a wrong path. After trying to figure him out I honestly didn\u2019t know and to play it safe I sprinted away from him as well.\n\n So I\u2019m running down the street still with my best friend and my mom railing behind me at some distance. The cops come next because my mom decided it would be the best to make sure I didn\u2019t get hit by any vehicles. ( I did have moments thinking about jumping in front a car to break the simulation but my fear of pain and if the simulation delusion wasn\u2019t the right delusion kept me from doing that). I don\u2019t resist and get hand cuffed by the police and they start trying to talk to me to figure out what\u2019s going on. At this point I was trying to see if the cops where demonic or angels or if they were part of the simulation. At one point one of the officers asked me to make my hands together like I\u2019m praying to help loosen the cuffs and it helped make my wrists feel better so I assumed this was a faith thing and I needed to start praying.\n\nThen, I get put  on a stretcher with my arms and legs restrained as well as handcuffs on. Once I get to the hospital they put me in this back room where it was all gray and away from everyone else since I was screaming \u201cHELP HELP!\u201d over and over again.  I was afraid of what they would do to me on that table. There was 10 nurses restraining me plus 4 wrists restraints and handcuffs and I went into a 20 minute screaming match because I thought I needed to fight my way out from the bad spirits or ascend god. They then IV me with some strong benzo which I didn\u2019t realize that\u2019s what they were trying to do to me. But within 5 minutes of them hitting me with the Benzo my racing thoughts slowed and I immediately recognized what had happened and basically started repeating:\u201choly fucking shit I just had psychosis episode and had 0 awareness I was in it until literally just now. \u201c\nThe things that confuse me the most about this experience is that I had taken acid from this batch on 3 other occasions including 1 time where I took 2 1/2 tabs and went through 50 chargers and i was completely fine. I also have about 100-150 trips under my belt and never had a single delusional thought let alone multiple until this trip. All my experiences with psychedelics prior to this trip always made me feel like I was going in a positive direction in my life and the way I was doing it was relatively responsible. I always anticipated \u201cbad trips\u201d anxiety, fear, confronting yourself in a way making positive change things like that . But I never had any indication I would have delusions or a psychosis episode. The whole thing has left me decently traumatized as well as my loved ones and I feel a deep sense of shame and guilt for what I have done. But I have been managing my anxiety and depression by tripping relatively frequently giving me the power to be so positive and humble in my day to day life.\n\nHowever,I obviously need to break from tripping for a good while as well as find other things that will give me fulfillment. But I also wonder if one of the tabs were super mega dosed (my visuals didn\u2019t subside until around 30 hours after dosing) so if I do ever return to psychedelics I\u2019m thinking that to stick to the ones that are active over 1mg to avoid a potential mega dose without realizing it.

Individuals with Asperger's can push 130-150 IQ for raw logical reasoning, but the same individual is less focused on social reputation and perception of status, causing them to be under-utilized and under-appreciated by most observers.\n\nAdditionally, anxiety can spawn from ability to accurately and precisely track a large number of variables at any given time while considering many polarized vectors. In this way, anxiety can be an artifact of intelligence.\n\nAdditionally, depression can spawn from perception of under-utilization and perception of unrealized self-potential due to things that cause anxiety.\n\nI get this feeling because you are similar to myself in that you are quickly producing large text communications that include very dense symbol complexity relative to median--with significant rare keyword utilization, indicating advanced vocabulary, indicating highly advanced thinking processes that can be difficult to unpack quickly for digestion by neurotypical individuals.\n\nConsider that if this is the case, a phrase such as \"causes the thing to have increased potential for occurrence\" could be shortened to one symbol: susceptible. If your thought processes are using mostly shortcuts to very complex ideas, you can  have extremely complex thought processes at any given moment in time, and they can be extremely difficult to unpack, leading to feelings of anxiety and depression as it's probable you \"won't feel heard\" or that \"no one is actually listening to you\", while people are making fun of you for \"droning on\".\n\nIf you can identify with some of this, I think you need a muse. You need a focal point to blast your full power visuospatial reasoning ability towards 24/7, such as a business or artwork.

The craziest park of that night was I took 4 chargers without breathing and said I wanted to see my buddy but what happened was I passed out and the second I came back I said I felt nothing and that it made me cry because I understood that he was gone and there wasn\u2019t anything left of him remaining. 2 weeks after that night I tripped again by myself on the same acid again 2 1/2 and 50 chargers and had another positive experiences even though I knew I needed to slow down on the nitros afterwords. Fast forward 2 more weeks I had my episode in the same amount being 2 1/2 tabs and only 1 hit of nitros that sent me spiraling into delusion. For more background on my tripping history over the last 2 years I\u2019ve tired lsd and various analogs, I extracted dmt, mdma, ketamine, nitros, 4 ho met, 5 Meo mipt, doc, dxm and various combinations. Never had a psychotic episode prior and the only other drug experiences that has severely fucked up my self awareness to that extent was benzos and alcohol but in those situations I was blacked out in this situation i remember every detail.", "replies": {"fsa6se5": {"score": 14, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gt0urr/drug_induced_psychosis_that_ended_in_me_being/fsa6se5/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1590848163.0, "body": "Some of this doesn\u2019t make sense to me, but you said your best friend had died within the past month or so of taking this trip?\n\nThat seems like a *huge* event, and whether or not it was at the forefront of your mind might not make a difference when ingesting a psychedelic (and dissociative on top of it.)

I can say for sure though when I was 15 buying MDPV, it always had a chemical smell with a slight odor of cum and piss, and when a-PVP came out and then a-PHP like 2 years later, the chemical smell got worse and worse and closer to semen and dirtier piss and old socks, I used to have to shower 3 times in an order of cold hot and cold again because the smell would RADIATE out of the pores in your skin, and I would get to school with people still commenting someone smelled like cat piss, cum, disgusting sweat and dirty socks, I never thought anything to this day in the RC world was as fucking disgusting, coming out of my skin, made me wonder how many underlying problems that shit had to cause on the body and mind...", "replies": {"ga5i2rt": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/jhzuap/lets_do_a_review_of_how_how_rcs_smell_like_when/ga5i2rt/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1603734300.0, "body": "So how would you describe it in a couple words / short sentences?", "replies": {}}}}, "ga59czd": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/jhzuap/lets_do_a_review_of_how_how_rcs_smell_like_when/ga59czd/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1603724303.0, "body": "Real good, acetone washed coke, smells like Gasoline.

Is it bias since he created them and had mescaline as his first experience? Why so many 2Cs when none of them is as lucid and clearheaded as LSD or breathtaking as DMT?\u201d\n\nWell fuck, I admit that I couldn't have been more wrong\u2026 After seeing people raving about boofing 2CD on some ancient bluelight thread I too gave it a go yesterday.  I took LSD countless times, had Ayahuasca with a Peruvian shaman and tried many RC tryptamines but none of them came even close to Mescaline, DOC and now 2CD in therapeutic enlightenment.\n\nAll three being phenethylamines is not a coincidence and even after trying one third of the whole dozen I no longer have any objections to the substances Sasha had picked and respect him even more.\n\n\n**EFFECTS 70mg boof**\n\nOnset occurs in 5 minutes followed by crazy escalation as reaching the peak takes only about 10 more minutes. The speed and power of this ROA is intense... Visuals are quite intriguing with yellowish fog everywhere and not much stimulation present. Heavy nausea can occur but gradually subsides.\n\nIt exposes you to some thoughts you might rather avoid and at first it might get uncomfortable however it does this in a gentle caring way. It might touch something quite sensitive for a brief moment nevertheless lets go when you had enough. Never forces you to feel a certain way and manages to keep this objective view on every thought. Yeah maybe sorting out shit that is actually tangible isn\u2019t as earth-shattering as DMT yet many tryptamines are unnecessarily religious. You may start speaking to God or whatever but what is it good for? I mean wishing for something to happen doesn\u2019t make it happen. 2CD is about neither about God nor the universe, it focuses on you.\n\nCome-down starts 2 hours after administration and in 2 more hours just aftereffects remain. Doesn\u2019t interrupt sleep at all.\n\n\n**COMPARISOONS**\n\nYou know how Bromide in the 4th position like 2CB/DOB usually makes the compound more stimulating and Chloride like 2CC/DOC much more chill? Since 2Cs are shorter lasting and easier to handle 2CB became much more popular. The DOx family is infamously too stimulating and last fuck all, no wonder DOC which is more laid back and shorter lasting is regarded as the best together with DOM.\n\nI have never had the pleasure to try DOM but it's other name, STP (Serenity, Tranquillity, Peace) is exactly how I would describe 2CD. I had a 10/10 time on DOC and 2CD managed to reach the same level of enlightenment. This is how I would imagine DOM, one of the greatest of all time, just with 2 distinct differences. Firstly you peak in 15 minutes so no 2 hour come-ups and secondly imagine the entire action is compressed to a mere fraction with 0 losses\u2026\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n11/10, fucking magic, MAGIC, no other way to put it. Sad truth is that 2CT2, 2CT7, 2CE have all vanished long time ago and 2CD will likely follow soon. I hope I run into them someday as they are probably even better.

I know some purists dislike it when other empathogens are compared to MDMA, but I still believe it\u2019s a handy way for me to measure what I\u2019m looking for in this class of drugs. Though there\u2019s one empathogen, just one, that I think tops it. \n\nIn reverse order, then:\n\n**9. MDMA once the magic\u2019s gone.**\n\nGorgeous come-up followed by three hours of confusion and frustration. Never again. \n\n**8. MDA. 60 to 100mg.**\n\nFine, and powerful enough, but lacks warmth and love. Has pleasant enough rushes but they\u2019re nowhere near as enjoyable as those on MDMA. Won\u2019t be this taking again as there are better RC alternatives below.\n\n**7. 6apb. Around 90mg (all my batches have been very pure).**\n\nSimilar to the above, but nicer (though there are nicer possibilities below). Wrecks my sleep for days afterwards, though, so I won\u2019t be taking this again. \n\n**6. Borax combo: 50mg 5mapb, 20mg 2fma and 10mg 4-ho-met.**\n\nThe 2fma in particular added little to the 5mapb and damaged my sleep for days. Considering the hype about this combo, it was a wee bit disappointing.\n\n**5. 5mapb by itself. 50 to 90mg.**\n\nPretty lovely, but just doesn\u2019t have MDMA\u2019s love and warmth or rushes, or energy.  And if I take over 90mg the experience becomes confusing and \u2018mongy\u2019 (comparable to going over 150mg of MDMA) and wrecks my sleep for days. Pluses: redosing works nicely, and 5mapb combines beautifully with tryptamines (but this report is trying just to focus on empathogenic experiences). I won\u2019t be doing 5mapb by itself again. \n\n**4. 3fea/2fea \u20183foria\u2019 pills. 70Mg 3fea and 30mg 2fea in each pill, 2 pills.**\n\nThis is where things got really fun for me. The experience has the warmth and empathy of MDMA and gentle rushes. But unfortunately no matter how many pills I take the experience just isn\u2019t powerful enough. I might do this combination again, though am more likely to stick to the real peak experiences below.\n\n**3. 1 \u20183foria\u2019 pill, as above, plus 50mg 5mapb.**\n\nThis is the second-best RC empathogenic experience I\u2019ve had and I\u2019ll definitely be doing it again. Has everything a peak MDMA experience has except overwhelmingly powerful rushes. The 5mapb seems to provide the power that the 3foria pills by themselves lack. Absolutely bloody amazing.\n\n**2. Those first few MDMA experiences. Approx. 120mg**\n\n**1. aMT. 40mg boofed to prevent nausea and to speed up the come-up.**\n\nHas everything my first MDMA experience had, except the rushes are even more powerful and lengthy and the experience lasts for 14 hours. I\u2019ve had better combinations such as Al-Lad + 4-ho-met, but aMT is the single most euphoric substance I\u2019ve ever taken. Presumably the need to boof it is the only reason it hasn\u2019t conquered the world.\n\nI hope this information is of interest, especially for others like me who\u2019ve long lost the magic of MDMA. \n\nHope you're all having a fun, insightful and safe holiday period.

It is a psychedelic first and an empathogen second and some people struggle to unlock the empathogenic effects at lower doses. It has a very long come-up which can mislead people into topping up before the full effects are predictable. \n\nBut here's the kicker: as well as being a serotonin releaser it is also an MAO-A inhibitor. This means that the higher the dose is, the more serotonin is released, but also the less serotonin can be broken down by the brain. \n\nThis makes it extremely dangerous at doses over 100mg and potentially dangerous at doses approaching this due to the steep dose-response curve. Everyone's brain and body are different. Fatalities HAVE BEEN recorded. \n\nMaybe the risk of hospitalisation is only 1% but with 70,000 people in this subreddit that would mean 700 people. When we are so used to substances like LSD where the risk profile is so low, I urge you all to take care with aMT.\n\nI will add that I have had a number of enjoyable experiences with aMT just as I did with NBOMe compounds.

It was meth for awhile but with no psuedo or ephedrine to use as a precursor it's racemic crank that is crystalized for aesthetics. At the right dose and using the right ROA, 2-FMA will ring your bell. Crank doesn't. Now 2-FMA burns more, mg for mg than methamphetamine. 3-FPM snorted feels like someone shoving a red hot ice pick up your nostril. It is not worth the slightly quicker come up than eating it. My comment regarding 3-FPM being better for a party is because I am more sociable and I feel a bit goofy, for lack of a better word. I would not want to spend 10 hours writing code or building a fence on 3-FPM. But 2-FMA will have me acting like myself, finishing the fence in eight hours and then screwing my wife for an hour or three.

Rest in peace.) I enjoyed the body buzz heightened sexuality and roll feeling similar to MDMA/meth and the psychedelic effect similar to eating 8-10 hits of blotter. We dosed at 2 PM on a Thursday afternoon. However there was a point about 6  hours into the trip where I began to become co concerned with the intensity of the effects. If it wasn't for the fact that my friend who was on twice as much was stripped naked by this point and perched on the coffee table in the middle of the room laughing like a lunatic while he defecated a stream of viscous diarrhea onto his table in the middle of a party of a few friends some who partook in DOC and others chose not too. Jeopardy the game show was on TV and one of the categories of questions was called Angel's and Demons and Alex trebek was asking people about biblical passages referring to Lucifer and Satanic references. Alex then grew horns and morphed and the contestants on the show were torn apart in fire. Then there was a documentary about Vietnam on and my friend who was wearing a camouflage coat became my tormentors as I was a prisoner of war in a camp and when he was asking me if I wanted something to eat it was  because he was trying to poison me . I said No although I was completely unsure if I did or not. At this point my identity had melted and I could not remember my own name. He threw me a cigarette which I cringed at in terror and flinched when it harmlessly struck me and I realized it was just a smoke and not a hatchet. At this point an acquaintance of mine realized I was gripping the chair I was sitting in with white knuckles, my teeth gritted, my jaw locked and my eyes pooled completely black with pupil. He asked me if I was OK. At the moment I was being erupted out of a volcano, blown into outer space, dying on a desolate planet and being reborn in a primordial ooze and nursed at the breast of an asexual being who assured me that the world was good and just breathe, dont panic, just breathe and hold on. Ten hours later at 6 am friday morning 16hours after dosing I was still experiencing intense visuals and amphetamine feeling but not so much that I could not safely walk  talk or be in public. We decide to go purchase alcohol and frozen pizza and cigarettes.  As I was transient at this point in my life I and it was winter In New York i donned a large winter jacket and book bag and brought it with me to the grocery store which was entirely way to illuminated I went straight for the beer cooler and put about 8 bottles of high alcohol content IPA's into various pockets of my winter jacket. Then a 12 pack of Bud Light 8 ounce berry a ritas cans went Into my book bag. A $4 dollar frozen pizza was purchased on my food stamp card and my friends purchased cigarettes.  As I walked past the cashier and out the store all I could hear was the clinking of the stolen bottles of beer in my coat. We began drinking them immediately outside.  When we returned the house now 18 hours afters dosing I was still feeling amphetamine affect but the visuals had quieted down considerably.  We continued to finish the alcohol and smoke cigarettes cook the pizza and discuss the prior evening and plans for the day. We listened to the Disco Biscuits and watched a few shows on You tube. I began retreating to the bathroom to masturbate several times as the chloro amphetamine was still running but starting to fade. 6 hours later and 24 hours after dosing I was still experiencing mild visuals but was entirely used to it and felt like I was really on the tail end of the snake. I decided to go steal more beer and food and stop by my other friends house to watch a marathon of The Walking Dead and drink myself to sleep. 29 hours after dosing and several drinks and 4 mg of suboxone later I began to feel even a little tired and began to yawn and stretch. I got comfortable  and fell asleep about 32 hours after dose.  Alcohol  and suboxone helped ease me into a rest. I was still experiencing slight visuals, mainly trails and floaters. After 6 hours of sleep I awoke. No visuals , and mild crash feeling post methamphetamine use. But cured with 1mg of clonazepam and 1800 mg of gabbapentin. Altogether I would say the psychedelic effect of DOC was more intense and longer lasting than any LSD trip I had. However i do not know how DOC I ingested. It must have been alot. I would advise anyone using this substance to clear their schedule for 2 days.", "replies": {"f68k2qp": {"score": 5, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/dpopgl/psychedelics_amphetamines_dom_doc_dob_etc_and/f68k2qp/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1572758101.0, "body": "Sounds like a lot of DOC.", "replies": {}}, "f61t7tn": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/dpopgl/psychedelics_amphetamines_dom_doc_dob_etc_and/f61t7tn/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1572675253.0, "body": "Holy hell man that was a great fuckin read, thanks for sharing.", "replies": {"f687uav": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/dpopgl/psychedelics_amphetamines_dom_doc_dob_etc_and/f687uav/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1572755042.0, "body": "No shit, where do I get some!

However it is rather long and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a good way to write a TL;DR. \n\nPrevious posts, [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/i0p78y/methallyescaline_mal_dosage_effect_and_experience/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) and [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/i95hgn/a_funny_little_alexander_shulgin_anecdote_i_came/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) \n \nDose: 55mg Methallylescaline fumarate\nMilky grayish white crystalline powder.\nMy SO dosed 42mg 4-AcO-DMT.\nThis was the 15th, and I\u2019m writing this on the 18th.\n\nDropped around one in the afternoon. The come up started about 30 minutes after. Mild nausea, and physical stimulation appear first. The nausea never got past mild, and started to subside after I threw up about an hour after dropping. The physical stimulation, however, intensified exponentially. I would describe it as a rolling euphoria, coming in squirming waves. \n\nWe hopped in the shower when the come up was really ramping up. The heat and water really amped up that physical euphoria/stimulation. This is also perhaps the most sexual psych I\u2019ve ever taken. Even more then 5-MeO-MiPT which is typically thought to be one of the most sexual psychs. \n\nAfter the shower we went and laid on the bed, both reaching our peaks. This chem has the longest lasting peak I\u2019ve ever encountered. It was at least 3 hours. The headspace was light, like 100ug LSD. Visually it was like 300ug. Physically incomparable.\n\nThe OEVs were neat, but nothing special, somewhat like mushrooms, exactly like 4-HO-DET. The CEVs were the most interesting I\u2019ve ever encountered outside of DMT. They were very realistic, 3 dimensional spaces, with various creatures. Another thing about them was that I had the ability to influence what I was seeing. I would imagine a thing and it would slowly resolve into greater and greater clarity in my mind\u2019s eye.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve already spoke on the most noteworthy part of this drug, the physical euphoria/stimulation. It wasn\u2019t like speed or MDMA where it\u2019s very CNS head space euphoria. It was more peripheral, like waves of pulsing light moving up and down my body. This is by far the most stimulating physical ecstasy I\u2019ve ever experienced, and I\u2019ve taken quite a few physically intense psychedelics. It absolutely blew me away. To the point where I was having a lot of trouble focusing on the wonderfully rich CEVs. \n\nThe comedown was pleasant and clear headed. However, all the squirming and muscle spasms from the sheer euphoria of the compound left me feeling exhausted, I definitely burned somewhere close to 10,000 calories from this trip. I\u2019m 6\u20194 and 250lb beef boi, so I burn a lot of calories just existing, though. \n\nWe each took 500ug flualprazolam around 1am and slept till 10am the next day. There was a lot of muscle soreness the next day. I\u2019m still experiencing some mild muscle soreness writing this on day 3. \n\nOverall: This is my new favorite psychedelic. My previous favorite was 4-HO-MiPT. If it didn\u2019t have the come up nausea it would be an absolutely perfect psychedelic, in my book. I would recommend this to almost anyone with some experience. \n\nHowever, I think, based off of all the info I gathered before this trip, that it\u2019s not a worthwhile psychedelic if you take a light or even mild dose. I wouldn\u2019t call my dose a heroic one, but it was heavy. I think that\u2019s where a lot of the controversy/mixed reports are coming from. It seems the stimulation would be uncomfortable and the headspace would be boring with little visuals, if one took a light dose like 20-35mg. Also one\u2019s ability to deal with come up nausea, however it wasn\u2019t that difficult to deal with. I think you just gotta go in to this one rather strong to get the true magic out of it, making it atypical in that way.\n\nInterestingly, me and my SO came up and peaked at the same time, my peak lasted almost twice as long, but the come down was about the same. Of course we cut it short with the benzo, but it was 85% over by that point. So it seems it has a very similar timeline to 4-sub-tryptamines, despite some reports stating it was much longer. It seems that\u2019s mostly just referring to the peek. 8-10 hours is pretty accurate. 12-16+ seems unrealistic.\n\nEdit; I could write a lot more, so ask for as much clarification if you want.

However it\u2019s not representative of the \u201cflavor\u201d of the headspace. It\u2019s unique. I found it to be joyful and more suited to extrospection, making insightful observations, than introspection. At one point we were walking around outside and we started observing dragon flys. Notice that there was a male and a female doing a little mating ritual that involved some complex flying maneuvers, and talked on that and evolution for like 15 minutes. I also played my synth/piano at the peek of the trip, and found it very easy and played better than I have ever played before. Which I wouldn\u2019t claim if I was alone, but I had witnesses lol. \n\nLastly, me and my SO are very lucky in that, we are closer than any couple I\u2019ve ever encountered.

I wouldn't want to wish the hell that is opioid withdrawal/addiction to my worst enemy. It's really bad... But so is fucking around with benzos too.\nShould you be able to get pharm grade opiates per prescription or otherwise, I would strongly advise you to only take them on a 2 to 3 day binge once a month and then stop. It's the best way to not get addicted but also takes a lot of willpower, especially as your very first opiate experiences will be the best ones in your life. A feeling of warmth and safety that you will always want to come back to. It sticks to your mind. That is, until you start using it daily and tolerance kicks in and you take it just to feel normal and not fall into withdrawal. That is the point when you are trapped. But again, same rule applies for benzos too.\nI used to be able to keep my opioid habit safe for many years. Never got physically addicted or withdrawals. But then they still got me. It always does. Same old story. I had to undergo 4 massive surgeries on my spine which kept me locked in bed lying on my belly for 2 months. Hooked up on a pain med machine pumping hydromorphone and or dipidolor in my vains, AKA \"hospital heroin\". In the mean time my father died totally unexpectedly with 60 due to an heart attack and my then girlfriend AKA biggest love of my life left me in  very cruel and cold way. I was left all alone (no siblings, mum died some years earlier ago due to brain cancer), no father/family, no girlfriend, just constant pain and lonelyness - and back then, before the media blew up the whole opioid crisis, an seemingly endless supply of dilaudid and oxycodone pills by my gp and surgeon. All in all the perfect recept for disaster. Long story short, that's the time when I got hooked. Then the opiod crisis began, doctors became very cautious on prescribing any more pain meds and cut down my prescription by 50 percent suddenly. Then withdrawal started... And heroin found its way into my body.

Maybe felt like half a pill or even less. I would say this first try reminded me of a light dose of speed. Effects started to wear off in two hours at which point I took another 15mg this time nasally. Effects came on in 30 mins and were similar. Felt a bit speedy but again not as present and very subtle. About an hour after this dose i took a 75mg dose of O-DSMT. It felt like the O-DSMT high and euphoria was magnified and certainly lasted longer. I enjoyed combining A-PCYP with this dose of opiod on the way down and I found them synergic. At night I did notice slight visuals on the ceiling! \n\nOverall I wasnt that impressed with this chem.

Neat!\n\nIn that case I can (truthfully) tell you I've been studying pyros since **2008**. That's **11 years**, if you don't wanna do the math...\n\nI've read dozens upon dozens of reports on \"underground\" forums that don't even exist anymore, on top of the big sites.\n\nAnd you couldn't have been reading too extensively, if you never saw **any** successful reports of oral use.\n\nAnd I'm not trying to convince you of anything, other than the fact that it works. It's also the only way most people can use them while still retaining strong self control, and not getting as many side effects. That's the benefit of oral.\n\nYou're basically trading rush for self control...\n\n>and oral route provides no rush in peoples experience but tons of negative side effects.\n\nNow you're moving the goal posts. You never mentioned a \"rush\" in your first comment, and I hinted at this idea myself, in my 2nd to last paragraph.\n\nNo shit, stims are less rushy when you eat them, rather than sniff / shoot / smoke. That's true of **ALL** stimulants, because it takes longer to get into your brain, and dopamine levels climb slower.\n\nAnd in case you missed it, like 90% of pyro reports out there describe them as having a nice rush, but tons of side effects, and probably more than they're worth. \n\n\n>i have no clue in a fiddlers fuck what you are getting at... \n\nThen you should probably lay off the pyros, cuz I thought that was pretty clear and straightforward...\n\n\n>Oh by the way, this is a analogue of A-pvp and not MDPV. lol?????\n\nAll pyros are basically MDPV's grandkids. It's the archetype for its class, because it was the first one on the RC market...\n\nAnd a-pvp, is just MDPV without the \"MD\" part....

What are your thoughts on this chemical vs the others? 2-fa 3-fa etc. \n\nI hear reports of people saying they barely got anything out of 3-fpm. Could that be due to tolerance or difference between batches? This is a very crystalline white powder, not much smell.\n\nEdit: Decided against the benzos it\u2019s been 4 hours since last dose and still feeling stimulated. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be sleeping tonight &amp; thinking about dosing before work I can definitely feel the addictive potential coming out.\n\nAlso does anyone have experience mixing 3-fpm with Kratom? Usually take 3-4 grams twice a day on work days and was wondering if there would be any interference.\n\nEdit: dosed 25mg (insufflated) on break at work (Metal Fabrication) and no euphoria but very focused and work is zooming by. No crazy jaw clenching but my pupils are defiantly bigger.

Super clear mind. No significant ego-boost.\n\n\\+30min: first rush is over. but the effects are still strong and apparent.\n\n45min: redosing 30mg; effects dont get stronger\n\n\\+2  1/2h: done about 250mg trying to reach the first rush (nonsense, just  an bad habit of mine, thats why i always prepack my stuff when i go out  so that i dont take too much - when i got 1g at home i'm just taking  250mg to the party).  I'm sweating (Troparil + 30\u00b0C in Germany). I can  do my college work easily and if even feel motivated. Great.\n\n**Result:**\n\nIt  was my second time Troparil. The first one was nearly inactive and i  thought: wtf thats wasted money. But this time it totally flashed me.  Didnt expect that. And the fact, that its nearly half as cheap as RTI111  and WIN35428 makes it even better.\n\nComparision to other Cocaine derivates/analogues:\n\nTroparil vs. WIN 35428: WIN35428 is a joke against that. Not a real rush. Just focused and awake (mildly)\n\nTroparil  vs. RTI111: Troparil doesnt burn as much as RTI111 when insufflated.  Duration is the same. I will look for the comedown, which was the reason  why quitted RTI111. RTI111 has an comedown for 4hrs where you cant  sleep and feel depressed and you never want to take drugs again. When  taking RTI111 anything over 120mg on an evening makes my heart beat  irregularly and my mood is shit because i dont get the rush anymore.  When taking Troparil i can take the doubled amount (?) without getting  any fucked up side effects.\n\nTroparil vs. Speed: Duration shorter; Bodyload not as strong as on Speed\n\nTroparil  vs. Benocyclidine: Troparil has an much nicer bodyload. Beoncyclidine  feels like a mix between coffee and modafinil to me. Benocyclidine lasts  longer but you have to take more mg to feel it (when taken orally).  Also benocyclidine is the worst chemical i ever put inside my nose so  look for taking it sublingual, oral or up your ass (or iv, im).\n\n**Conlusion**:\n\nIt's  a really nice substance. The price is more than good. Compared to  cocaine where you (as an not weekly user) take arround 0,5g and pay 40\u20ac  (in Germany) you can have an nice evening with troparil for 12,5\u20ac (hope it's okay to post  prices when no vendor is mentioned). Probably its cheaper because there is no need to take 250g.  150mg will do the same for sure (for an male, 64kg, 24y, no tolerance). **You have to try yourself what doses are fine for you.** Start withy an allergy test (1mg) and then do 5-10mg until you feel good. And if you dont feel an increase in mood- just stop!\n\nFor further Informations about the substance: [https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Talk:Troparil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Talk:Troparil)\n\nAnd feel free to ask questions.\n\nSorry for my english!", "author": "Fraggdachs", "score": 28, "flair": null, "created": 1596772763.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/i4yzi4/troparil_and_other_cocaine_derivates_experience/", "num_comments": 36, "title": "Troparil and other cocaine derivates.

Were talking branded bath salts containing mephedrone, 2Cxs, BZP pills and herbal blends of JWH018. As these products were so much stronger and cheaper than street drugs there was a massive decline in the black market. To be fair drug gangs did get involved in the rc market (which was far from clean) and id say contributed funding to the anti legal high hysteria. I remember arriving into my city early for work one morning towards the end of the pre ban era to find smoke hanging for miles. A drug gang had bombed a very succesful head shop to put them out of business. Alot of money was found in that fire proof safe ill tell ya. The shops did such good business there was some 24/7 ones that would serve through a hatch. Chinese delivery drivers were known to pick up shit late at night and bring it with your food for a nice tip.\n\nAlthough later during this period I got heavy into mephedrone (hadnt taked mdma or cocaine at this stage so you can imagine how much more the already legendary euphoria was amped up and im not sure if ill ever get near the level of psychosis aswel from meph binges) my main focus was spice. gold, silver, diamond, yucutan fire etc. These blends were interesting to experiment with albiet a lot more tricky/messy/addictive than cannabis. Some would cause hallucinogenic and delusional states. I can remember walking across a field listening to the chatter of trees in the wind. Stopping to watch as they talked to one another with increasing understanding of what they were saying to the point id become one myself. No longer watching from my body but looking out from up high  at the little figure of myself.\n\nI remember a shop opening in a very upper class area and that was the breaking point. It didnt last more than a month after that. Mothers in arms on all the late morning talk shows speaking about the evils of these substances and the benefits of prohibition. There was a really weird patch after the ban where street drugs hadnt come back properly yet and the shops didnt have to close straight away. They got rid of some weird shitty products that somehow werent covered in the band. Ill never forget the intense projectile vomiting and no other effect some post ban headshop pills i got gave me. This brings us up to the year 2010.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn 2012 I went camping in the UK with some scottish friends. It was a lovely site. Yurts and tents set up in a clearing surrounded by dense magical forest. No civilisation for miles. One of the first days we went into town and picked up a bag of herbal insence from the head shop. We took a small puff each from a pipe and went to see Prometheus in 3d in the cinema which was dope. Later at camp we discovered just how heavy this particular noid was. Very delerius and trippy. The next day me and a friend went of exploring in the woods with the spice and a pipe. We got really fucked up I cant recall what happened but we lost the bag and pipe. Returned to camp ready to be punished by the rest of the gang.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few days later later I set off into the forest alone to clear my head after getting myself worked up in my head over some shit in my life. It was a perfect summers day and the sun shone through any gaps in the tall trees that it could. I came to a small clearing with a pond and a fallen tree. The fire pit in front of it added to the look of this perfect accidental bench. I sat down. At some point I noticed our pipe was on the ground with a very large barely smoked bowl of spice in it. I did what anyone would have done at that moment. I took the call. My jet lighter made short work of the packed bowl and i coughed my lungs up.\n\nI got very high very quick. Uncomfortably high. Crazy. I could hear the sound of summer and kids playing nearby. I stumbled in the direction of the sound. I realised through a small area of forest parallel to the clearing was the back of a cul de sac. This freaked me out i wasnt prepared to deal with people. It was shocking how close this housing estate was. walking around its parimeter a little and gaining some elevation i notice how large and pristine the estate is. Like edward scissorhands. I made contact with an entity named Jacob. Not sure exactly when he arrives but its soon after discovering the houses. He makes me aware of the forest 'motorways and highways'. We go to the edge of one. A cleared straight path with hundreds of blurry figures 'power walking' at high speeds going either way on either side. At the time nothing seemed out of the ordinary.\n\nI believe a few other things 'happened' between the highways and when shit got terrifying. I recall stripping and running across a field with jacob haha and i remember falling into the pond (this happened for sure). But everything started to get really awful when i noticed the distant angry screaming of my parents. I felt so ashamed. They knew i was high. They were worried sick and had in my mind at the time brought me on a nice family holiday. I had screwed it all up. Ruined it. I guiltily started to make my way back and there shouting got louder. Jacob left me to deal with this shit on my own. Very near the camp but still hidden in the woods i became super stressed about facing them. I kinda froze for a while.\n\nI started to sober up a little and certain facts started to come back to me. Mainly that my parents where in another country and most of what i had just experienced was total hallucination. There was nothing but forest out there but id seen a whole suburban world. I could still hear the screaming but i now knew it was my friends looking for me as id lost track of time. I navigated my way towards the voices and when i caught the first glimpse of tents I was like Andy Dufresne at the end of shawshank. Victory pose. My redemption. I legged it over to them feeling like it had been forever and with the look of someone who had just survived death. Well of course nobody had been screaming. Nobody was worried. It had been max an hour since i left. I just looked like a gobshite and they tore me to shreds in their adorable accents.\n\nOne of my friends was going on about these UK blends containing salvinorum analogs. I dunno about any of that. I have many crazier and dodgier tales but i always come back to that housing estate in my mind and my imaginery friend Jacob. So many of my noids (and hallucinogens in general) trips were with friends in various types of wooded areas so so many of my psychedelic reference points are tree related.", "author": "199me", "score": 29, "flair": null, "created": 1578221034.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/ek6tnm/into_the_woods/", "num_comments": 31, "title": "into the woods", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fd6m6w1": {"score": 4, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ek6tnm/into_the_woods/fd6m6w1/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1578221813.0, "body": "And if you don\u2019t mind, what are you using right now?", "replies": {"fd6mc0a": {"score": 5, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ek6tnm/into_the_woods/fd6mc0a/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1578221864.0, "body": "cannabis atm", "replies": {"fd6mf8f": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ek6tnm/into_the_woods/fd6mf8f/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1578221895.0, "body": "Only weed?", "replies": {"fd6mkw4": {"score": 4, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ek6tnm/into_the_woods/fd6mkw4/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1578221947.0, "body": "yeah i was on binge recently of a pcyp and then a php but im taking a week or two off anything but weed", "replies": {"fd7ercy": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ek6tnm/into_the_woods/fd7ercy/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1578232134.0, "body": "Pcyp better than pihp?", "replies": {}}, "fd7n7rs": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ek6tnm/into_the_woods/fd7n7rs/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1578235872.0, "body": "How is A-PCYP compared to a-php/pvp, hexen, NEP, etc?

Did do MDMA, Speed and Coke a few times.\n\nDon\u2019t use drugs on regular days only on parties or when I go out to clubs and stuff\nI really dont like being drunk and i was looking for something that was in between coke and mdma.\n\nFew friend told me that 3MMC was great and you can buy it legally in a Smartshop where i live.\n\nSo on new years eve i did MDMA and 1 month after that i tried 3MMC for the first time on a party . I heard it sucks to snort so at first i did around 150 mg oral. After 30 minutes i felt a really warm feeling just like the first time i did MDMA. Could talk to everyone about everything. After 2 hours i snorted around 20 mg. 1 hour later again 20 to 30 mg. This was around 3 o clock. An hour after i did another 50mg. after that another 30 to 50mg. Came back home at 7 and could not sleep till 9.\n\nThe day after was not horrible but i did had a headache and took some asprine. (dont know if thats a good idea btw). I slept for a few more hours and felt pretty good. The whole week i felt fine, did not feel depressed or something which i was afraid of because i did MDMA a month before which also has effect on serotonine.\n\nSo i went out this Saturday and tried 3MMC again. This time pretty much the same dossage. Feel like a heroine addict while using it. Just onna take more and more. Day after was pretty good no headache or what so ever.\n\nI have a party this Saturday and want to take it again. Planning to take a break after that for around 1 month.\n\nI would like to hear your opinion about it\n\nIn my opinion its a very good RC and i really like it.

I mean I never do more than planned and such. Till I met Hexen. Wanted to do 40 mg. Ended up vaping 80 mg, plus 50 of diphenidine and at least 40 in 2 map 237. This stuff is more addictive than everything I have ever tried (ranging from heroin to coke to speed and I am just outnumbering the hard ones). I am not even complaining, I knew what I was putting myself into however, after this 80 mg sesh I will put it to rest for a while. Also it numbs the pain (today early in the morning I did a wrong movement while doing squat and probably ripped my tendon). After the first few puffs the pain was gone, more effective for pain relief than actual opioids. It doesn\u2019t even put too much strain on heart. I mean it is \u201conly\u201d 120 bpm and I mixed it with a lot of stuff, 25inbome makes my heart go up to 140 and DPT bad trips make my heart go up to 143. I don\u2019t feel lots of vasoconstriction and it feels relatively safe, also sert activity feels non existent... I feel motivated,primed and ready. Bonus, albeit not feeling any kind of sert acrivity I feel chatty and empathic but not in a forceful way. Wonder if this could be a replacement for PTSD patients cause there are still no evidences it can be neurotoxic. I am not even sweating that much and my temperature is as \u201clow\u201d as 37.8\u00b0C. Probably cathinones with a methylene deoxy moiety would be more suitable for PTSD patients, however the reason why MAPS sticked to MDMA is probably because MDMA doesn\u2019t give this monstrous compulsive redosing.

On the other hand, I know 4-HO-MET is the easiest psychedelic for this combo, so I do it.\n* **+05:20** \u2013 **Nervousness: Stim or Psych, who wins?** I think the first 20 minutes of the trip was the most difficult to manage: It was like if I took a psychedelic **ALONG with** a heroic dose of  stimulants (= same time). My hands were shaking, anxiety and stress were high. 4-HO-MET just triggered the \u201cdormant\u201d effects of 4F-MPH. It wasn\u2019t easy to calm myself down but I tried as hard as I could, taking deep breaths, listening to \"speedy\" meditation music, and rational thinking made me go through this part of the trip.\n* **+05:50 to 09:50** \u2013 **Superman state:** I managed to calm myself down. Now I feel very stimulated (positively) with a nice psychedelic vibe. Truly amazing sensation. My body felt very light, I could move easily, dance. Juggling with balls was so easy. My brain performance was like at max. I tried cognitive games and I was impressed by the performance (+ 25% score). Much better than stimulants alone (+10% average)\n\n....\n\n* **+10:00** \u2013 **Effects ending:** Starting to Feel a bit exhausted\n* **+11:00** \u2013 **Sleep:** I usually have some trouble sleeping after taking 4F-MPH, but this time I managed to sleep easily.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     TLDR: \n\nI tried the combo of 4F-MPH (a stimulant) and 4-HO-MET (a psychedelic)\n\nit was quite challenging to control then nervousness and stress. But the experience was fully worth it after the initial phase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n    Effects Summary:\n\n* **Sensory: 5/10** Visual effects were limited to more vibrant colors, HD vision but little warping. Good music appreciation.\n* **Physical**: **9.5/10**: Feeling light, taking a cold shower was amazing. No heart palpitation or side effect except feeling hot.\n* **Functionality and Learning Potential: 9/10** I learned things much faster than with psychedelics or stimulants alone. It\u2019s perfectly functional in a home setting. Not for work.\n* **Spirituality: 1/10** the stimulant part makes your thought race and doesn\u2019t let you think deeply about things.\n* **Difficulty / Risks: 7/10** It was difficult for the first 20 minutes. Anxiety and nervousness were very high. I had to dominate my stress levels and calm myself down.\n* **Sleep and after-effects: 9.5/10** 4-HO-MET always makes me have great resting nights when I mix it with something else.

To try again but with slightly lower dosages.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n    Thoughts:\n\n**Effects Similarities:** This experience felt close in effect to my past experiences with 30/70mg 2FEA/3FEA combo. Slightly less euphoric, but the \"fluidity\" of the psychedelic made things more interesting.\n\n\\------\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\n* Needing a motivation/euphoria that you can't find with regular (=functional) stimulants.\n* When you want to learn something that you really struggle with (Juggling with 4 balls for me).\n* Looking for an unusual headspace\n* Lower dose.\n* Controlled Environment (Air Conditioning Recommended / Cold Non-Alcoholic Drinks)\n\n*(At your own risks.)*\n\n\\------\n\n**Not Recommended:**\n\n* If stressed, anxious, impulsive.\n* Not for a work setting\n* Not for newbies.\n* If you have people around you.

I am CaptainEtazene and I'd like to write something about etazene.First of all, it is a very strong opioid. It differs slightly in action from classic opioids. It is a molecular speedball. If you take little, you feel everything at once: euphoria, speed and relaxation. If you take more, euphoria is growing, but the opiate action profile is getting stronger, until you finally fall into opioid drowsiness. Compared to isotonitazene and fentanyl, it was hardly seen to cause respiratory depression. Removal of the nitro group [https://imgur.com/in8mfuX](https://imgur.com/in8mfuX) from etonitazene caused smaller respiratory depression, less hypnotic properties and increased speedball effect.After that, you can work normally and be even more productive than when being sober. Just don't overdo with dose. Small doses - euphoric; high doses - heavy opioid.\n\n*How to dose it?* For total opioid beginner: 0.5-1 mg per spray in nasal spray, causes high euphoria and a feeling of soft legs. 1.5-3 mg already makes you fall asleep.\u00a0 When someone took 30 mg of pure he vomited, went on all fours but was happy.\n\n*How about tolerance?* It grows terribly fast. Within a few days, the dose to be taken to obtain the desired effect can increase several times. There's cross tolerance with other opiates.**The important thing is that a dose depends on the method of administration and what etazene is administered with**!!! For some routes of administration higher dose is needed! Ask your vendor which administration route is best to use for a given etazene product.

After about 40 minute or ingestion I was in absolute pure bliss, never in a million lives would I ever guessed that there is such a state that exists, I mean you know the rest of the story, it's fucking MDMA....\n\nI fell in love with this drug, but I was well aware of its dangers and how often I could take it, I never took it more than once every two to three months, but I hated that, yet I was willing to wait and not loose that magical feeling.\n\nEventually I got the chance to use 3mmc, which had a warning by the dealer that is has addiction potential due to low tolorance, at that time I never experienced addiction other than a bit of craving for weed, but that wasn't so bad.\n\n3mmc when taken orally gave me a mild MDMA high, less heavy on the body and pretty euphoric, a bit similar to speed, it makes you happy, cheerful, friendly as fuck,you just wanna talk with fucking everyone on social media and like their posts for no reason,  it can also make you a horny beast who can last 7 hours masturbating.\n\nI was taking it orally, about once every 2 to 3 weeks, I had no cravings or anything to take it, but I loved the drug very much, and was willing to experiment further with it, the day I decided to snort the substance was probably a turning point, now my brain knew  how can it release dopamine and serotonin the easiest, and it will trick me to go buy some even if it means getting broke, fucking your health, money and relationship.\n\nNow I'm using 1 to 1.5 grams a week, once a week, and I never broke that pattern, although I'm still in the danger of increasing my use, it's actually a good thing I'm pretty broke now because of it, as it's not that cheap where i live (130$ for a g).\n\nNow I can't break out of this cycle , it's been going on for more than 8 month, I get cravings on once a week, but once I get the craving for lines binge, I will find a fucking way to get it, even if it meant borrowing money from friends and lying to them.\n\nI need your help, I don't know if deep inside me I really want to quit cuz I might be using this post just to pretend I'm doing something about it. A comment here or personal message is very appreciated, I cannot go to rehab yet as I live with a religious family, and if they know about any of this I'm fucked... \n\n\nWhat the drug taught me about addiction:\n\n-The more I used, the more familiar I got with the feeling and the harder it got to fight the craving.\n\n-The drug will take priority over almost everything, I think about it often.\n\n-Snorting stimulants is fucking addicting.\n And other shit..\n\n\nSome effects I have now after long use:\n\n1- cognitive abilities are pretty good, but i was much sharper before.\n\n2- my sleep quality is pretty shit, waking up in the morning feels like hell.\n\n3- My memory is OK, but i do get a bit clumsy a day or two after use.\n\n4-I get triggers from seeing anything related to drug ritual, just seeing credit card can remind of the drug.\n\nThat's what I can think of for now..\n Sorry for the long post but I wanted to share and I'm pretty desperate for help at this point, and help spread awarenesses of the potential dangers of this rc.\n\nThank you \u2764\ufe0f", "author": "misterLastTime", "score": 37, "flair": null, "created": 1603959495.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/jjzsx4/what_3mmc_taught_me_about_addiction_i_need_your/", "num_comments": 28, "title": "What 3mmc taught me about addiction + I need your help. *Post Might trigger drug cravings*", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"gagczl2": {"score": 9, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/jjzsx4/what_3mmc_taught_me_about_addiction_i_need_your/gagczl2/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1603969061.0, "body": "You definitely have an instinct to stop and I highly suggest you follow your gut.

Like a psych or a disso, or even another stimulant with less serotoninergic activity would definitely be better for your neurochemistry.

According to my (limited) research it would appear one pill is enough, however my own personal experiences with molly and the like have taught that you shouldn\u2019t always have to adhere to prescribed guidelines (in order to get to that eye rolling/vibrating place for example). \n\nSo basically lads, will i pop one and call it a nice n chill evening (along with some weed), or will the fiendishness take over about an hour or so into it leading to it all being devoured in one go, and consequently as a result, a very unpleasant sleepless night (along with the obligatory brain damage).\n\nAs a side question regarding its neurotoxicity, having taken a some molly a month ago (~300) would it be a sort of breaking of the 3 month rule thereby resetting it? (I.E. is there any cross-tolerance between the two?)\n\nTLDR; got some 3-mmc to try for first time, how much to take and what to expect? Is fiendish compulsive re-dosing inevitable?\n\nPS. If there\u2019s anything out there im missing out on please let me know, so far I\u2019ve only had 2-fma, 4-fa, clonazolam and etizolam (my favourite so far)\n\nUpdate: not at all what was expected, took one, felt chill, took another a bit later, compulsive redose is less prevalent than with speed and coke. It is described as a hybrid of coke and molly but i dont feel either, feels like slightly cleaner speed, maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s a first time. Either way, can\u2019t say i see the appeal, need to up the dose perhaps?\n\nUpdate on update: finished em all by 7pm as the comedown slowly started creeping up, hoping for that mdma-like eye rolling stage, is this attainable with a dose of 240?\n\nSpoiler: it is not", "author": "YoungStalin420", "score": 3, "flair": null, "created": 1596521070.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/i36pau/3mmc_metaphedrone_first_timers_questions/", "num_comments": 22, "title": "3-MMC (metaphedrone) first timer\u2019s questions", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"g09pzvw": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i36pau/3mmc_metaphedrone_first_timers_questions/g09pzvw/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1596525765.0, "body": "One will get you a pleasurable coke but better high experience, 2 will feel like molly.

Scales have drastically come down in price and gotten better quality in the last 10 years. There is also huge number of different models to choose from now. Scales can be had as low as under $5. Great ones for bit over $10. Good milligram scale for bit over $20.\n\nI like ordering stuff from eBay. It's fun to test out things. In the last 10 years my apartment has been searched countless times by police always resulting in the loss of my scales. I have given away all my scales when I have tried to stop using drugs. I have borrowed scales to a friends in need who never returned it. Or just given away for various reasons.\n\nI have experience of many different scales from varying price brackets. Here are my recommendations. I have nothing to gain from this. Just sharing my experiences to help others.\n\nIn my opinion it's mandatory for everyone to own two scales. You need a quality 0.01g and 0.001g accuracy scales. Scale with 0.1g accuracy is absolutely useless. Never buy such a scale. Price difference to 0.01g scale is not significant. \n\nPeople often recommend the Gemini 20 scale. I think that's a carry over from 10+ years ago when there were no other options. I have owned few and it's no a good scale. No wonder people who own them think small amounts can't be measured even with a milligram scale. \n\n[NEWACALOX 0.001g / 100g. \u00a320 shipped](https://www.ebay.com/itm/NEWACALOX-100-50G-0-001G-Digital-LCD-Jewellery-Weight-Pocket-Scale-USB-Powered/283492700904)\nMilligram scale with 100g max limit. That's a rare sight. Built in battery that is charged with micro-usb. Mine has been on very heavy use for months still going with the first charge. Previous scales that I have owned start to give inaccurate results as batteries run low and the worst thing is when there are no replacement batteries available. This scale is also very accurate when calibrated correctly. I trust the scale accurately measure 10mg doses. But this requires good technique and several measurements to be sure. Under 10mg is still volumetric territory.\n\n[NEWACALOX 0.01g / 500g. \u00a310 shipped](https://www.ebay.com/itm/NEWACALOX-500g-x-0-01g-Electronic-Jewelry-Scale-USB-Powered-Digital-LCD-Display/283511893121)\nSmaller brother of the previous scale with 0.01g accuracy and 500g limit. Built in battery and all that other goodness.\n\n[Small portable pocket-able scale 0.01g / 100g. \u00a35 shipped](https://www.ebay.com/itm/163779457902)\nTo carry with me when I need. All other scales that don't have the cover permanently attached with hinges suck. Cover gets loose and the scale gets damaged in backpack. This one is accurate enough for everybody's needs. Just note that cheaper scales are not at their best in the low end. So measure with extra weight like the cup you are going to put powder in.\n\n---\n\nHuge thanks to /u/cookiej0e, /u/hexachoron, /u/GammaMT and everyone else in the comments!

When i got there at 11am he asked me to test some of the butylone and report my experience to him as he was planning on taking it that evening. I happily complied and took around 100mg orally around 12am.\n \nThe come-up is swift so after about 10mins i feel a high similar to 4-FMA but with less bodyhigh and euforia. I make the choice to complement this with 2 bumps of 3-MeO-PCP.\n\nAfter that i had to take a couple of trains to get camera equipment for my studies. At about 4pm i suddenly feel the butylone high wear off at an incredible speed but dont really crash. The PCP high is still going so i take 2 more bumps with a couple of hours in between.\n\nAfter requiring the cameras i rush them to my place because i was going to party in the city with his friends that i barely knew. So i'm running with two heavy bags of proffesional equipment whilst dissociated af and still feeling kinda speedy. I can feel that i'm straining my muscles but i just keep going. \n\nFinally i can go have a good time at 8pm so i brilliantly decide to put some 4-FMA up my nostril (a key). Once i get there i realize everyone's just drinking so i feel kind of awkward being the only one high and try to hide it. As the evening continues though i snort another key of 4-FMA and take 3 bumps of 3-MeO-PCP. I completely drop the act and start walking in circles around the group, dance to nonexistant music, climb on shit, hop in front of the group like a 10yr old girl but they seem to accept me and laugh at my silliness.\n\nIt's 12:30 am when we settle down in someone's house to watch a movie. The 4-FMA is losing it's effects and i start coming down in a somewhat dissociated state. At 2am i realize i have to either go home before i can't anymore or do some more 4-FMA. I finally make a wise decision and decide to leave with a pretty sober friend only to find that i'm barely able to walk! \n\nMy legs and my neck hurt like crazy and i have very shitty balance so putting on my shoes feels like torture devised by Satan himself. On top of that i haven't eaten since breakfast so i'm starving and nauseous at the same time.\n\nSomehow i manage to climb on my bike and drive home at the pace of a snail on ketamine. I forcefeed myself meat, bread and yoghurt as i'm honestly scared that my body won't be able to deal with the abuse i've put it through without some sustenance. I get to bed, notify my friends and.... stay awake for  the rest of the night because this combo apparently doesn't know the word sleep. Finally i decide to write a trip report because i'm awake anyway.\n\nI'm a film student btw and in a couple of hours i'll have to use that fucking heavy, expensive camera.

I was still having vivid CEV\u2019s that were intricate and brightly coloured until at least 5:30am\u2026. I cannot recall if I slept or just lay meditating in a state of astonishment and awe; for that last trip was the deepest K-hole I have ever traversed. Never have I been so far gone from my reality, quite literally transported through a metaphysical plane of dimensions\u2026. While simultaneously being completely aware of whom I was and where I was.  \n \n\nThe setting for this was my room; which was unfortunately messy due to renovations taking place in my bathroom. I was by myself with nothing to do. I had 325mg of S-isomer ketamine left from my stash\u2026. Now, I have been using ketamine for years, and I thought I had hit the k hole numerous times\u2026. but looking back on it, I believe I only truly hit a \u201ck-hole\u201d 3 times. The first 2 times were accidental, although a couple weeks ago I dipped into my stash, and looked up dosages on Erowid.org\u2026 Previously, I had always eyeballed my doses and thought I was taking big lines, at a k-hole dose\u2026. I mean, I was very dissociated to the point you could say I was tripping; I really thought I knew what I was doing with this drug\u2026\u2026 boy was I wrong.   \n I recently bought a fine jewellery scale for my 4 substituted psilocin analogues that I bought from my local RC vendor (4-aco-dmt, 4-ho-met, and 4-ho-mipt). So I dipped into my stash of k a couple weeks ago and scaled out a \u201ck-hole\u201d dose according to Erowid.org\u2026. Surprisingly, a k-hole is much more than I previously thought. That trip shattered my grip on reality and provided some of the most intense hallucinogenic anesthesia I could have hoped for. When I came down from it, I was so blown away that I had to call my friend and explain my trip.  \n \n\nSo fast forward a couple weeks and I have nothing going on for the evening; I decided I want to traverse that state of mind again. Now, normally I would be working, out in the woods, but my boss got into a gnarly mountain bike accident and I had to rush him to the hospital the night prior. My day was spent driving 3.5 hours to the lodge we had been staying at, to retrieve our belongings. I got home, cooked a fantastic meal for my family and was in a very good mood; despite being worried for my boss and best friend (he was going to be okay). THE TIME TO TRIP WAS NIGH.  \n \n\nI scaled out a gram of sacred lotus 25X extract, brewed a tea and proceeded to smoke a few bowls from my bong. I had the bright idea of mixing 25mg of 4-HO-MET (which I will refer to as methylcybin or colour) in with my initial pre-load bump of k\u2026. when I do K, I always start with a good bump(s) to get well acquainted with the effects first; before I take my fat \u201ctrip-rip\u201d and lie down. I had done colour thrice prior and didn\u2019t find 25mg to be that visual of a dose. I expected I would have mild OEV\u2019s, but I just wanted to add more distortions to the k-hole. I was excited to try a new combo like this. I have combined mushrooms and ketamine many times and knew I could handle it.  \n \n\n**T+10:30pm-** 50mg of ketamine and 25mg of colour have been insufflated. Colour burns like hell to snort and tastes horrid in comparison to K. I begin drinking my sacred lotus (with some ginger tea added into the mix) and already notice alerts 5 minutes later. The familiar warmth and euphoria of K begins to make my face heavy and I notice textures have way more depth, minor perceptual distortions begin 25 mins later  \n I was taken aback by how I didn\u2019t expect that amount to get me on such a good trip that was increasing in intensity; normally after 40 mins I would be either at the peak or past the peak. Yet, it kept increasing (probably due to colour taking longer than k to take effect.) Blue lotus and ketamine is a combo I have done many times, which provides unbeatable euphoria, and allows me to trip off less.   \n I put on the album The Magnolia Electric Company, by Songs: Ohia. Holy fuck I feel good; I am experiencing amazing synesthesia\u2026. Although, I started getting weird and dark vibes, like something was gunna pop out and jump at me. I look down at my un-made bed and saw an aerial view of a scene from my memory, of me and my ex-girlfriend back in 2012, making love. I felt the intensity of the love in the moment, as though I was reliving it in real time. Obviously, this was just a bunch of pillows and crumpled bed sheets, but I re-experienced a precious memory. I had always had a toxic and co-dependant relationship with her, but we always remained friends and never stopped loving each other. I became so happy for her and where she was; in love with another man, I became so proud of her for finally getting the psychological help she needed and cherished the times we spent. A single tear of joy rolled down my cheek. FUCKING WOW I thought, that\u2019s deep.  \n \n\n**T+11:15-** Effects have barely gone down slightly, for someone on horse tranquilizer I\u2019m very lucid mentally. The lotus and K must amplify the visual effects of the methylcybin, because I feel like I\u2019m on a level 3 mushroom trip. I rip another 30mg ketamine up my nose and in minutes this drastically increases the effects. I feel an almost electrical euphoria and I feel warm, as though I\u2019m sitting next to a campfire. I take off my shirt and crack my basement window to smoke some bong out of it. I rip another small bump (25mg?)of K and sit on my bed smoking weed\u2026. Suddenly, I see two glowing green eyes approaching and getting bigger in the darkness; I get a wave of K effects increasing, and think my reality is falling apart\u2026. I swear I thought I was having a stroke, as a wild raccoon tried to sneak its way into my house from my window, right before my eyes. In a knee-jerk reaction, I leapt to my feet and tried to scare it off. This only angered it, as it hissed at me loudly; so I punched it in the face and screamed \u201cGET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE YOU DIRTY FUCKIN COON!\u201d as it scampered off into the distance. Obviously, I was referring to the raccoon, and my heart was pounding with adrenaline\u2026 but I became self-conscious of how racist what I just screamed out my window sounded. I laughed very hard afterwards and shut my window.  \n \n\n**T+11:45-** I\u2019m having a very groovy trip, like I am on mushrooms and my motor coordination is impaired. Spacing out provides astounding open eyed visuals, which refocus back to a level 2 mushrooms trip when I stop zoning out. I have been smoking weed consistently and chatting with friends online until this point. I feel as though the colour is beginning to peak for me. I rip another 70mg of ketamine and it is otherworldly. My floor is fractalizing. I feel like I am k-holing, but still very aware of who I am and where I am. I go to the bathroom and discover that walking is surprisingly much easier than one would expect. Normally, walking on ketamine feels foreign and weird, yet this time I feel fantastic and walk with a smooth gangster strut, off to the pisser. Peeing was very hard; I had to go sitting down in order to get my stream going\u2026. I then sat on the toilette after peeing - forgetting I just peed; and tried to pee again to no avail.  \n \n\n**T+12:05-** I was seeing the checkered pattern on my bedsheets flow like water, with the texture of clay. I closed my eyes and saw 3 dimensional Aztec and indigenous artwork playing before me. My ponytail brushed my back in a creepy way. I began to feel paranoid of spiders.  \n  A slight shadow in my room seemed darker than it should and fractalized in a way that could resemble a spider, though it was not a spider\u2026 I didn\u2019t let this get to me, though I felt a strange wave of uneasiness as the K kicked into gear and smacked me in the face. Suddenly this intensified, and I got an extreme sense of \u201cenvironmental orbism.\u201d My own paranoia, combined with after images of my surroundings, manifested into a very pale outlined image of a jumping spider (looking dead in the eyes), right on my wall; made of slightly different orange, peach, yellow and emerald green hues. This manifested for 2 seconds, before morphing into a trippy looking cat and vanishing. This would normally freak me out, but I was in a wondrous state of anxiolsysis. I soon kept zooming in on textures around my room, to a state of wild macropsia, and realized everything in this Claymation realm I was in was changing materials; and that material was cats. I was seeing, almost on a cellular level that everything around me was made of soft, adorable kitties. Purring, whirring, writhing around and snuggling. The carpet - everything as well as my body, was just a quilted mesh of kittens. Seeing this and realizing this tickled me with delight. I felt so enthralled with joy that it reminded me of a child, who knows he\u2019s been good, and that his parents and Santa love him on Christmas; wholesome as fuck. I closed my eyes and saw an epic purple flying fortress that looked like a sabretooth tiger and an Egyptian cat god on top, his sceptre emit golden fractal light and this palace opened up at the mouth and sucked me inside of it. I was soon in a purple and blue digitalized esophagus portal, just being sucked into a massive subterranean cave, containing an indigo and emerald green coloured flower, made of mineral crystals and was moving as though it was a sentient being; shimmering beautiful auras of light.   \n I opened my eyes and I was sitting on the end of my bed. My carpet looked purple with blue spots, and the weave of the carpet manifested into some symmetrical texture repetition, protruding out of what looked like an elf-alien\u2019s head\u2026 a bright blue electrical aura grew around it as my jaw dropped in astonishment...  I smoked a fat bowl with blue lotus extract on top. Moving around made my external hallucinations dissipate and become less apparent. I lay back and basked in the euphoria. My closed eyed visual were absurdly wild.   \n At one point, I became one with the realm of my closed eyed visuals and saw Mrs. Puff from SpongeBob Squarepants freaking out; inside this comical machinescape of whimsical cartoon imagery I was beholding. In the most shrill, exasperated and guttural tone, she started screaming, \u201cOHHH SPOOOONGEBOB, YOU CRASHED THE BIIKE, NEVER CRASH THE BIKE!! YOU FAILED, FAAAIIIILED!\u201d  \n My field of visuals panned over and I saw my friend/boss who recently crashed his mountain bike, all fuckin\u2019 mangled and plastered onto a big rock; his skin had the texture of SpongeBob and the way he was plastered, literally looked like some kind of sea sponge. \u201cI broke me cunt!\u201d he replied, in the thickest Australian accent imaginable. \u201cI found a fukken rock, it looks like a sword\u2026.FUCKIN OATH, CUNT\u201d he stated, as he cut Mrs. Puff in half; popping her like a balloon. Bubbles, stars, and lightning poured out everywhere like a pi\u00f1ata; I laughed my ass off.   \n I opened my eyes and realized I was definitely at the peak. I noticed that I needed to go to the bathroom. I had listened to the Songs: Ohia album twice, and put on the album Rastaman Vibration, by Bob Marley. I sat there vibing out to the music for a couple songs, before realizing I was gunna piss my pants soon. It was dark between my room and the bathroom, yet I decided not to turn on a light, because I could transparently see my CEV\u2019s with my eyes open. The song Johnny Was, played and became fainter in the distance. The further away I got from the speaker, the song began changing. Eventually, my mind was processing the song in a way where it was a completely different song. This background noise, accompanying the ceiling fan in my bathroom, created a monstrous symphony of blackened death metal music. This was blowing my mind harder than any mortal song ever could. It was the best song ever fucking made! I started doing vocals to this music I was hearing and became a rockstar. As my piss stream began, a ripping guitar solo started shredding. My mind was thoroughly exploded.   \n \n\nI turned off the ceiling fan and the music stopped. I walked through my dark basement, back to Bob Marley. My CEV\u2019s were less apparent in the dark, but they were still there. A translucent film creating level 5 geometry was sprawled across my visual field. My basement was a realm of red lightning and levitating red cubes, along with blue orbs and stars fluctuating around the room. I saw 3 pufferfish swimming around the room, in fishbowls that were levitating. These fish looked like a cross between my friend and Mrs. Puff. \u201cHOLY FUCK\u201d I thought as one of them swam by while it said in a nasally voice, \u201cFuckin weiiird\u201d. My imagination was in overdrive. I came back to my room and smoked some more weed; as these effects were starting to diminish.  \n \n\n**T+1:00am-** I was still righteously high, though I knew I was coming down from the K and possibly the methylcybin. I sat up on my bed and saw the remainder of my K, all busted up into one massive line. I\u2019d say the dose was at least 150mg. I was so thoroughly impressed by this combo; I knew I had to dose it all at once. I also knew I had to do this sooner than later, as I didn\u2019t wanna be up all night (in hindsight this made no difference, as I didn\u2019t sleep regardless). The Bob Marley album finished and I put on the album, The Magnolia Electric Company by Songs: Ohia again. I divided this line into 2 lines and smoked one final bowl in preparation for the k-hole  \n **{*****NOTE:*** *This is where my trip truly becomes otherworldly. I am doing my best to describe these hallucinations, as there were possibly thousands of them; and many of which I can\u2019t remember. So I will take a break here just to list different works of art; in the hopes that you can view them and get a better grasp of this level 8B geometry I became a part of. Try to envisions all these hallucinations and geometry in the same form of style as these paintings and artwork*  \n ***Gaia - Alex Grey***  \n ***Breakthrough - Larry Carlson***  \n ***Abstract - Matt W.

I took one line up each nostril, grabbed a glass of water, took a difficult piss (mild urinary retention) and came back to my room. I got comfortable in my bed and noticed my trip was kicking in fast. I felt like I was flying around on a rollercoaster, as an orgasmic body high took over. My teeth became numb as well as my fingertips and felt like they were being stretched through a vortex; almost like being sucked through a black hole. Any visual effects of the 4-HO-MET became drastically increased, until I was blasted off into level 7 geometry. From this point on, I started flying through dimensions, landscapes, scenarios, and scenery as my entire field of vision became an interactive canvas for incredible surrealist paintings and Claymation seeming environments. I began feeling like I was melting into my bed, in an orgasmic kind of way. The scene I was viewing before (a window, my closet, and a desk) morphed through some visual haze, into an ornate palace made of flowing, iridescent playdough. I was transported through a portal into some magical fairy-tale land full of mushroom forests, dinosaurs and dragons. I likened this to being in a Super Mario level made of fucking playdough. This massive shift in environment frightened me. My jaw dropped in astonishment. \u201cAm I dead?\u201d I asked myself. I felt my heart and noticed it was beating quickly, but it was still healthy and normal. I noticed my breathing was consistent and normal and I was fully self-aware that my name was Eric and I was tripping on K and methylcybin in my room. Suddenly a green portal opened up and a demented and psychedelic version of Rick and Morty crawled out, on top of the palace. \u201cGoddamnit Morty, this is why I use the portal gun\u201d Rick said, as they both retreated back where they came from. This scene quickly morphed into an ancient Chinese empire made of sandcastles.   \n \u201cHoly fucking fuck!\u201d I thought to myself, ecstatic with delight. A pink and gold version of Shenron from Dragonball Z flew overhead and winked at me, as fractals made up the sky and frogs climbed the steps to the palace, before disintegrating into orbs. I closed my eyes and got sucked closer to the palace, until I was outside the entrance. The drawbridge opened and an elf-alien head was looking me dead in the eyes. It seemed like it was very impressed that I managed to arrive before it and it opened its mouth. Sucking me into a completely other world of wonder. Everything became digitalized, in an almost mechanical seeming way, as I was falling down a hole of psychedelic geometry. Some of these colours were colours I didn\u2019t know existed and when they appeared it was like they melded through my eyes, behind my field of vision and crept into my soul. I was now one with my visuals. I became these landscapes and geometry. I simultaneously perceived an exposure to semantic concept networks while becoming the inner mechanics of my consciousness\u2026. THIS ENTIRE TIME, my ego was fully intact with itself. I could get lost in these dimensions but I always knew who I was and what was going on.  \n \n\nFor example, ads kept popping up on YouTube and taking away from the trip. I knew to skip them! I could see my speaker shining clearly within this machinescape, because this fantastic environment was actually an emanation of the synesthesia my speaker was producing. I skipped the ads with no difficulty and proceeded to vibe to the music again, basking in the divine splendor. I could feel these hallucinations physically, as the machinescape was constantly shifting and changing. I closed my eyes and saw a prehistoric marsh, full of angels and surrealist looking creatures. A gigantic toad\u2019s head rose up from the marsh, shot its tongue at me and ate me. I became sucked through another digitalized esophagus made of purple, green and blue geometry, until I ended up in a belly that was another fairytale type land. I saw what looked like a cross between a lion and a serpent, smoking a joint in a room that seemed like Alex Grey must have painted it.   \n I managed to get to my weed and bong and smoke a bowl. This increased these effects to incredible levels. After this point, it would be almost impossible to describe the hallucinations I was receiving. My mind was processing info at a ridiculous speed, as I became a thousand different landscapes and hallucinations. I felt fucking amazing.  \n \n\n**T+2:40am-** These incredible effects started to leave and I knew I was well past the peak. I had listened to the same album a few times and decided to smoke a bowl and try to sleep. I smoked my bowl, and scraped whatever tiny scraps of K had stuck to the plate into a tiny bump. I was still very high and impaired; I went to take a pee and returned to my bed. I sleep in a basement, with pillows over the windows, so zero light can enter my room. As soon as I turned off the lights, I was immersed again in a brightly colored machinescape of CEV\u2019s. Thousands of them! One distinct one that I remember was a science fiction type landscape that looked like ancient Egypt, made of gold and sapphire. UFO\u2019s were flying overhead, as reptilian beings danced and smoked a hookah with this caterpillar race of people. I was seeing absurd scenarios like the Eric Andre Show, which could not be explained, but were fucking hilarious.  \n \n\n**T+ ????-** This visual imagery was becoming less bright, but I could still not sleep as a result. Considering I was coming down off an anesthetic, I was unnaturally horny. I started dry humping my bed, until I had to give in to my fantasies. These fantasies played out like actual memories I was reliving. This felt so good, that I may as well have actually been fucking these girls I slept with. In my dark room, I moaned uncontrollably like a slut, as I ejaculated so hard I soaked the top of my shoulder. As I came, I saw an entire nebula of galaxies erupt from my dick like a geyser.   \n My ex gf was named Ocean, and a psychedelic and beautiful version of her manifested; levitating in mid-air. She had beautiful flowing blue hair, much like an ocean, as amazing auras of energy and dolphins radiated from her. She sucked my load of galaxies into her mouth, like a supermassive black hole, and made precious eye contact. I don\u2019t know how to explain my psychological reasoning behind this\u2026 but I felt as though my cosmic orgasm literally gave birth to new universes and dimensions; possibly thousands, maybe millions of them. I cleaned myself up and relaxed in astonishment. Meditating in silent wonder, I played some creepypastas on YouTube and tried to sleep. This was an exercise in futility\u2026 HOW CAN YOU SLEEP KNOWING EXTRADIMENSIONAL TRAVEL IS AT YOUR FINGERTIPS!?  \n \n\n**T+10:30am-** If I did sleep, I didn\u2019t notice, and couldn\u2019t have slept more than a few minutes\u2026 Not wanting to interfere with my sleep schedule, I got out of bed and began really reflecting on how incredible that trip was. This trip will be next to impossible to beat. I have full intentions of repeating this combo.  \n  As there are almost no reports of it online, I knew I had to record it for science.  \n  If anyone else attempts this, I implore you to record the effects. I eagerly await the future where I am able to acquire more ketamine and am in a proper spot to repeat this trip (possibly with higher dosages)  \n \n\nIt is important to note, that although I did not sleep, I did not feel hungover. I mowed the lawn, did some gardening, and began writing this report until about 1:00am.   \n \n\nIn conclusion, this trip surpassed all expectations, transported me to other worlds and is now held in my eyes as the BEST psychedelic drug combo EVER.

Hold 7 seconds. 8 long seconds out. \n\nIt helps relax me. I do it a lot. \n\nAnd I was nervous. \n\nI was on a 24 hour dry fast. No food. No water. It helps with my auto-immune-like symptoms and I feel great during it. \n\nI drank one glass of water to break the fast and loaded my Rap\u00e9 applicator with nicotiana rustica powder.\n\nI blew into my left nostril. Sharp pain. Teary eyes. I'm used to this. \nI re-loaded and blew into my right nostril. Sharp pain. Teary eyes. The works. \n\nAnd after this short cleanse I felt A LOT better. Completely ready for the experience, and ready to let go. \n\nI brought my small glass water pipe to my lips with 5mg 5-MeO-MALT preloaded in it, sandwiched between two layers of oolong tea leaves. I do this tea-leaves thing with smokeable tryptamines to keep from burning the active material and creating harsh smoke. I THINK it does something? \n\nIt's tradition. \n\nI light the material and breath deep. The airflow isn't great and I do not lift off. It's subtle. The walls are wibbling but that's about it. \n\nI use the rest and do get a strong body high, but nothing mind blowing. I can feel that it is telling me to release all tension in my body and let the drug do what it will with me. I feel somewhat anesthetized, and moving is difficult. \n\nWhen this wears off I ask the little man in my head(the little man that is always there, not a drug-induced little man) if I should take more 5-MeO-MALT. He replies \"NOPE\". I ask him if I should take some DMT. That, he IS in to. \n\nI want to blast off, because I'm not overjoyed with the lackluster effects from the botched 5-MeO smoking. \n\nI load in 40mg and smoke it all. I got it ALL in one toke. \n\nAnd I lied back and closed my eyes. I was surrounded by higher dimensional clowny boys, all playing 4 dimensional jump-rope with each other, and while I was amused, I wasn't exactly impressed. I still felt entirely in the room, other than for the visuals. I told the clowny boys that I'd be looking for a blastoff with the next try. They seemed supportive, though they continued to jump rope with each other until the visions faded to the point that I could reload the pipe. \n\nThis time with 11mg 5-MeO-MALT. And I did not botch the airflow this time. \n\nI got it all. \n\nWithin seconds I felt launched at incredible speeds inwards. The visuals were less-so than the non-blastoff of DMT, and yet the experience was so much more profound and stimulating. \n\nMy ego was stripped away and I was yoinked right into the center of infinity. Into that space where all things swam around me. Even **I** swam around **ME**. \n\nI had the concerning thought that I needed to try to remember where I came from so I would return on the comedown. \n\nI felt like it was extremely realistic that one could enter this space, and then return to the wrong frame of reality. I didn't want to come back to the finity(from the infinity) into the body of a dog or something. I mean sure that could be fun but I've got a life going on here! \n\nI felt the thought, threw out some trust into the universe that it would deliver me home safely, and allowed it to strip another 10% of me away. \n\nAs I began coming down and the layers of me slowly returned, strong feelings of kinship with my friends came through my mind. I desired deeply to converse and message them. I wanted to be with those buddies and let them know how much they mean to me. \n\nI felt the desire to connect with my female friends at respectful, completely non-coercive levels. I recognized toxic masculinity in myself, and gave it to the universe. The universe ate it up and pooped it out into tiny less-so-toxic masculinities and I felt free of a lot of that shit. I still do too! (4 hours later)\n\nIt was curious that I saw no entities on the 5-MeO despite the experience being so much more intense than the DMT. It was just me and the universe as one in holy holy loveydovey matrimony. \n\nAlso, It all did feel subtly sexual, but in a very healthy way. \n\nThanks for reading!

MDMA's values are around 650%, 550% and 225% for serotonin, dopamine and NE respectively. [Source](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jts/41/3/41_329/_pdf/-char/en)\n\n[Here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Neurochemical+binding+profiles+of+novel+indole+and+benzofuran+MDMA+analogues) is a paper which suggests that the effects of 5-MAPB and MDMA on the transporters are pretty much identical, which is weird because even without reuptake inhibition, direct neurotransmitter release often happens by reversal of these transporter.\n\n[This](https://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC4500375&blobtype=pdf) paper is interesting but doesn't have anything on 5-MAPB unfortunately.\n\nI can't really find conclusive evidence right now but at least it's clear that it is much more selective for serotonin. Anecdotally, having used it myself at 65mg, dosing 3-FA (very selective for dopamine) halfway through, I can attest that it suddenly felt a lot stronger and MDMA-like. Keeping in mind the success of popular combo u/borax made years ago (maybe you can chime in), and how lackluster 5-MAPB apparently was on its own, my guess is you don't need nearly as much when adding an amphetamine; these tend to potentiate each other greatly, but that's just my experience and what I've read from others.", "replies": {"fn41fjm": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/fz44db/how_would_adding_an_amphetamine_affect_the/fn41fjm/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1586660910.0, "body": "I agree with this. 5-MAPB was definitely not useless but a small amount of stimulant really changed the character.

Was a really nice time and our communication improved, was actually pretty romantic haha. She was scared of nausea but got through it really well, it's all about getting lots of water and breathing really deep.\n\nI agree with the stories I've read, if I were to give it a personality it would be 1p's gentler patient cousin that waits for you, whearas 1p is more like \"LET'S GO!\" and the bodyload hits you like a train. Which i sort of like for the physical energy, you just need to use it and not just sit back or the tension gets painful. With 1cp i would say the comeup was at least twice as long, more time to get up to speed with it, and lasted a maybe 1-2h longer than 1p. Faded away like a cloud like other lysergamides. My exp was consistent with most accounts I've read so far. \n\nI agree this stuff is the closest to real lsd though not as deep and full, I would say potency is roughly the same or maybe a little less than 1p? It's hard to compare because the ride is so gradual, not as intense. In that way it is similar to real lsd. I still like 1p in its intensity but 1cp i would say is better for someone's first time. Very smooth ride. \n\nI did hours of yoga/strengthening exercises, drank probably 4-5L of water lol, deep breathing, we made a nice rice lentil turmeric mushroom dish at the end of the day and it was super satisfying. 7am now getting ready for work, feeling nice and calm, sleep was good, muscles feel more balanced, posture improved, inflammation way down. \n\nI love doing yoga/stretching on lsd, the control and awareness I get of my body is improved and i can turn on my deeper core muscles consciously with the right breathing. I think the inflammation response is dampened and it allows your nerves to branch out more freely. I think 1p is a little stronger in that aspect, or maybe it's just that it hits you faster. I have a decent sheet left so probably will be taking more soon and will report with a higher dose. Looking forward to it. We're going camping in early Oct so that'll be a nice trip :)\n\nWould recommend 1cp to someone wanting a gradual calm ride with moments of introspection, it waits for you.

I had rather high expectations for this since most people describe it as a \"hidden gem\" and also since I love 2C-B. I have tried 500ug and 1mg before with only threshold effects present. I tried this with nothing else other than weed and nicotine throughout the experience\n\nDuration - 6-7 hours \n\nT+0 - I cut the tab into 3/4s and put 1.5mg under my tongue. After a minute or two I noticed an odd metallic taste. \n\nT+10 - The tab dissolves fully and an uncomfortable amount of saliva has built up in my mouth, so I swallow it. This is relevant later on. \n\nT+40 - I notice the first alerts while taking a shower. It feels like there is a slight cool energy building in my calves. It's subtle but apparent. I also notice that my thoughts are becoming clearer and more analytical in a way. \n\nT+90 - The body high is more pronounced now and it reminds of 2C-B, but except its more refined and less buzzy, if that makes sense. It's also a bit more subtle than 2C-B since there is much less of a body load.\n\nThe mental effects are apparent now as well, and it's subtle yet distinct from other psychs. It has an analytical, neutral headspace. The whole experience was very neutral, neither positive nor negative. I could tune into the analytical thinking by focusing and I could also space out. \n\nThere were very few visuals throughout, although I did notice some slight warping, very slight tracers, some amount of colour enhancenent and lights were brighter and left after images. It's definitely not nearly as visual as I was expecting, \n\nI feel like this is because I didn't take the dose properly and didn't get the full 1.5mg due to me swallowing my saliva after 10 minutes. 25E-NBOH is not active orally, only sublingually, nasally and vaped to an extent, according to anecdotal evidence. I think if I left it sit under my tongue for longer I would've gotten a stronger experience. \n\nT+150 - The novelty of this headspace has already worn off and I found myself wishing I had taken 2C-B instead. I am feeling on edge and a headache is starting to come on. I take 300mg L-Theanine to try help with the mild nerves. No more visuals are apparent, although I finally notice some mild CEV that are chaotic geometry in blue and green. They don't really capture my interest though as they are too fast moving and faint to really see anything meaningful. \n\nT+180 - I could definitely see analytical headspace being useful as a tool for self reflection. I found myself able to think about the root causes of my anxieties with clarity and without the usual self pity and self loathing. So I guess I at least got something out of this experience, although it felt even more shallow than a 2C-B trip. \n\nT+420 - I manage to fall asleep somewhere around 7 hours later although the headache got even worse than before. The comedown was smooth enough with the exception of the headache, which I found even worse than the headache on a speed comedown. \n\nSummary - This substance is not what i expected it to be. It has a very neutral headspace, mild body high, subtle yet powerful analytical headspace. I developed a rather painful headache about 2 and a 1/2 hours in which really ruined the experience. I can see its potential as a tool for self reflection but I wouldn't do it recreationally personally. I'm a bit disappointed with how the substance but I'm glad that I tried it.

Took 20mg in january with a friend, it was what i expected from this RC : light, fun, very visual. Strong psychedelic \"feeling\" but light headspace.\nI took 10mg in february alone at my house, it was mostly uncomfortable. Like being stuck between reality and psychedelia. Almost no visuals.\n\nNow, yesterday i took 15mg alone in a forest i know very well. I was confident about the setting, it was early in the morning, a monday morning, i was sure i would not meet anyone. Plus i know a lot of shortcuts through the woods, most of them filled with brambles and tall plants. I was not so confident about the set : I struggle with a strong social anxiety. I'm in therapy since mid 2019, and that changed a lot of things in my mind : i have learned a lot about how my mind and my anxiety are functioning, and why. However I cannot for the life of me \"understand\" emmotionaly what i learned, like everything makes perfect sense cognitively, but that gets stuck somewhere in the way of fully understanding all of that.\nI figured 15 mg would be a perfect visually enhanced forest walk dose, if things went south i could just do whatever i wanted basically, even going naked would be a non issue where i was. \n\nVisually enhanced forest walk my ass.\n\nAt 8am i drop the parachute. My stomach contained 2 butter and jam toasts. First alert 2 minutes after droping. The come up was hard, honestly i cannot remember much of what was happening. the memories are mostly a dense fog right now. However, i remember that human centipede clearly. \n\nThe first time i met them, it was somewhere after the start of the come up. About 50 old persons, walking in a line, All of them equipped with the same walking stuff : fluorescent jackets and caps, walking sticks. It was okay-ish, i just walked past them until i found a path perpendicular to the one i was walking on. \nThe second time, i saw them from afar. I was already super confused by the come up, there were no paths i could take to avoid them without turning back, so i just ran away as fast as i could. At this point i start to get super anxious about them. Why the fuck is there 50 freaking old people walking in a secluded portion of the forest ? What about covid ? What are they thinking about me right now ? Runing away like that ? I'm certain some of them saw me. So i continue to run. It feels super good, my body is light and feels like it has been oiled. So fluid.\nThe third time ? That's when shit went south. I was mostly done with the come up. I thought i just did a horrible mistake taking this substance. Everything was so intense : the smell of wet wood was out of this world, I could feel my breath and my heartbeats 15 times stronger than normal, my legs were beging me to take a rest, the common bad trip inducers were racing in my mind : \n\n-\"I just walked through most of the forest and only 2 MINUTES have past ? I am going to get stuck like that forever !\" i respond \"No, That's not happening, nobody got stuck in a psychedlic experience. In 3 hours i will be back to normal. That's gonna feel like an eternity, since my sense of time is apparently fucked up, but it's going to happen. I took that shit, i'm assuming. Let's walk.\" \n\n-\"I will be changed for the worst when i come back ! psychosis or schizophrenia, that's sure !\". Again i respond : \"no, i have no mental pathology running in my family. I have a shit ton of uncles and counsins, no psychiatric conditions. That's not happening. Now let's assume and walk\".\n\n-\"Oh my god that heartbeat ! Do you feel that heartbeat ? And it's hard to breath ! That's a heart attack coming in !\". \"Nope, i just ran like a madman uphill. And i sense every single things in my body 10 times stronger. Also, anxiety, you are not helping with the breath. I'll take a few deep breath here. Aaah, okay, feels good. Now let's assume and walk. I can't stop apprently, so let's continue.\"\n\n-\"These people, they saw you runing away. They know something is strange with you. They might call the police, or psychiatric hospitals to see if one of the residents escaped recently. Also what if you meet them when full on tripping ?' \"Yeah, that's kind of a problem. No way the police will come here to find me, and if they do that will take more than 3 hours. It certainly looks like something is off with me, and if i meet them when the peak takes full control, that will be a problem. But theres no way for come up me to resolve this problem. I'll see when that happens. Now let's walk.\"\n\nAnd there were visuals starting to appear everywhere too : faces and eyes in tree barks, the wallnut shells covering the ground were breathing and morphing, the forest had some kind of fantasy filter on it, every shades of green and brown were amplified. But i couldn't care less about the visuals. They were part of this dimension i walked in, and i was as attentive to them as i am attentive to the usual forest i walk in when sober. I knew it was going to be an intense experience. More intense than my 20mg one. Why ? How can it be that mentally intense when 5mg more was super mellow ? Is it even the same RC ? Did my scale fuck me up ? What is going on ?\n\nI was going out of a brambled-filled shortcuts when i met them again. I arrive almost face to face with an old lady. Did she stop or continue walking ? Honnestly i dont know. But she was looking at me, and here face was right out of a psychedelic art book : symmetrical, looking like some kind of raven. Her facial expressions were shifting every seconds, and every single one of them was judgemental. I don't know what to do. I'm in full panick mode. I try to do the most normal thing i could possibly think of, wich is a head nod. She does not respond. Did i fucked up ? Did i really nod ? Was a nod appropriate for this situation ? And what is this situation anyway ? I feel pathetic. She knows i'm having a difficult trip alone in the forest. She knows everything about me. She is not happy. I look at my right. Theres an endless number of people coming. I can't take it. Fuck, i'll just stop acting like i'm a normal person. I can't do it anyway. So i run back at full speed through the brambles. I almost get stuck. But i finally put enough distance between me and them.\n\nAt this point my whole reality is anxiety. I want to curl up into a ball and wait the end of this trip. I can't take it anymore. OF COURSE YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DO THAT ! Go head on, fight that shit ! You can't let it dictate how you are going to live ! Walk, it's so easy to walk. Get angry if you need to. Anger feels good. Curling into a ball ? First that will not stop the experience. That might even increase its intensity. Also, that would mean that you accept to stop living. Curling into a ball is not living. It's like these people you want to talk to, but you can't. And being afraid of the jugment of everyone. It's not living. You don't want to be that person curled into a ball all his life. Walk ! Assume ! Live ! Even if it's hard like now, even if you feel like you are not yourself anymo...\n\nWait what ? A rush of terror runs through my body. What happened ? What is happening to me ? It's like my normal self, that i identify as an analytic monologue (or my ego maybe, i'm not sure if i can call it like that), disapeared under the strength of this psychedelic steamroller working on my mind. Or maybe it was stretched so thin it couldn't transfer data to my consciousness. It also felt like my mind was being forcingly opened by the substance, and the inside of my mind was like one of these drawers with files classified in it. They were every components that constitutes \"me\". Okay. That sounds and feels terrifying. What can i do now. I remember someone who had a difficult trip once, he spent 2 hours running. Okay i'll do that. Sounds great. \nBad idea. As I run, my mind drifts farther and farther away, until that point where it feels buried under a 10t weight. My thoughts feel physical. I can feel them stretching and drifting, and they seem to accompany the movements of the visuals in the forest. They are closely linked, like one single entity. I stop runing, i'm already tired physically, and i don't want to give more space to the \"physical death\" anxious feeling.\n\nI don't know where i am. I don't recognize the path.\nMeh, you won't get me like that. It's kinda easy to find one of the principal paths in this forest, and there are indications at most intersections. Going out will be easy. And that would mean that this experience is over, wich is nice. I couldn't care less about being lost if that means i'm normal again. I can't wait. NO !! Assume, this experience is intense, out of this world, do you really want to wait for it to stop ? Like waiting for an uber under a shelter from the rain ? That doesn't sounds like something someone who wants to live would do. It starts raining.\n\nThis decision of assuming has a direct impact on the trip. I am no longer this anxious entity lost in the middle of the universe, i am a primitive being walking through a foreign forest. \nWalking is important. I know that. Breathing is essential. I am thirsty. Water. Breathing feels nice. It is important. I am warm. I remove my hood. Walking is important. Breathing is essential to survival. I am cold. I put on my hood. Is this feeling hunger ? I don't have food. I will, later. Not important to think about that now. Walking. Rain, a lot of rain. Shelter.\n\nI find a place where the trees offer a good cover against the rain. It feels like this place was designated for me. \n\nStopping walking have a direct impact on the direction of the trip. I am back to being this anxious entity. And there is no way i can get away from that now. Walking feels like a very distant idea. The primitve being i was is like a distant dream. \n\nMy mind is being meticulously analysed. My head feels like modeling clay being worked on. The smells are intense. It was neither wet wood or the rain. It was something i only remember smelling during my past trips.\n\n-Anxiety, here you are. What do you want of me now. \n\n-Cry, you need to. It's been more than a decade since the last time. It will feel good.\n\nI feel extremely sad all of a sudden. I try to cry, but i can't. Everything gets stuck in my throat, like a valve i cannot open. I start to feel extremely nauseous.\n\n-That might be something. Try to puke. You know that feeling of emotions being stuck in your throat. You have encountered it many times in your life. If you can't cry them out, try to force it and puke them out. No it's not disgusting. Anxiety is a waste left by your childhood experiences. Something you had to create to cope with your life back then. Now it served it's time. You don't need it anymore. Is it something someone tripping balls would do ? puke the anxiety out ? See, that's what your maladaptive schemas wants you to think. Your social anxiety lies here. You are alone in the forest. Be yourself, puke. \n\nAnd i try to force myself to puke. Nothing gets out, my stomach is nearly empty, but it feels SO DAMN NICE. Like going up towards the surface. I still feel neauseous a bit, but less anxious. \n\nThe next part is nothing but a big, dark cloud in my memory. I felt a very strong wave pushing in, then it was like a psychedelic dreamlike state. There are some things i do remember : \na constant loop of rising anxiety, then puke. Going inside my mind, pushed by the psychedelia all around me. Remembering memories of things i completely forgot, mostly situations linked to social anxiety. The shadow of a panick attack creeping in. A flash of lucidity, where i understand that what reality is has completely changed. Being lost is tormented waters. A tree, like nothing i saw before. It was the only thing existing in the universe at that time. There were roads on its bark and the branches were little trees, I felt like i was watching it from the top of the tallest mountain in the universe. No tracers at all. A fox. Another fox. Another. The same fox ? Couldn't sit, i was afraid of that. Had to move some way or another. The discussion with my anxiety continues. I feel like i'm making progress, cannot remember anything about what was going in my mind however, but i was forced to do it. No escape route possible. It feels like the anxiety is another being, connected to me through threads. \nThen i say something to myself. I cannot remember what, but it was a judgmental thinking about myself. Something normal me would think. I realise what it is, that it is not me, something vile and worthless that i don't want in my life anymore. Suddenly, it feels like the substance RIPPED the anxiety from me. A mask taken off with the strength of a thousand men.\n\n-----------\nAbout 15 minutes have past since i took shelter. An eternity in my world.\n-----------\n\nMy mind feels clear and bright. Like an ocean of the clearest water possible.The music (Shpongle, second track on Tales Of at this point in time) is taking my hand to show me how beautiful this dimension is. The singing at the begining of the track is a benevolent entity coming from everywhere around me. textures and patterns morph and breath along with the music.\nI simply walk slowly, in a state of child like wonder. My mind is still wide open, but instead of a critical analysis of what's inside, the molecucle is playing with me gently : it shows me joy, wonder, happiness, and many sensations i cannot put words on.\nEvery single leaf is magnificient. Every bark have so many details, the more closely i look, the more fractal-like patterns appear. The faces look like benevolent alien females.Walking feels fun, breathing is intensly good. Drinking water, i feel like a light deprived plant placed under a big shiny sun. I am extremely thankful for what i just came through. I feel purged, cleansed. Like walking on a shore after a long swim in tempestuous waters.\nThe music is closely linked to the narrative of my experience. I feel like it tells the molecule what to do.\n\nI walk back to the shelter. The closer i get, the more anxious i feel. It takes some time to click, but i understand that this place will be closely linked to anxiety for the rest of this trip. I decide to go there anyway, like visiting an old friend. I know the place, i know these feelings that invade me. I can decide to stay, or to walk away. I touch the trees, i feel a strong empathic feeling going through me. It's ok, you have social anxiety. You don't need to bash yourself for that. It's ok. I think about the human centipede. I have been as judgmental to them as i felt they were to me. Did this lady was really not happy with me ? I don't think so. She might have been surprised, shocked, frightened, worried, or she might also see that i was certainly on some kind of substance running through brambles and find it funny. I was angry at her for fucking up my setting in a difficult moment, and that went right back at me. I was the one not happy.\nI walk away. \n\nSomewhere around Shpongleyes, I remove my earbuds, i want to trip to the music of the forest. Suddenly my mind calms down. The intensity of the trip seems to have diminshed greatly. Or did it ? I'm not sure. Everything stoped breathing, i couldn't find faces and eyes anymore. Everything looked very still, but i could feel that i was still tripping balls. I look at trees in the distance : after a few seconds, everything looks like a painting. The song of the birds, the rain and the trees form a coherent linear track, and a low pitched rumbling noise starts forming in my ears. \nI close my eyes. The painting stays there, and white foggy spirals move around the trees. The spiral transform into arrows, and into other multiple arrows. Then donald trump. \nWhat the fuck ? Of all the things i want to see and think about right now, that's in the very bottom. Okay i'll continue with my eyes open.\n\nI stretch up, that feels unbelievably great. My body feels tired. My legs hurt, my shoes and my jogging are soaked, i'm cold. But i like that. It feels good.\n\nMy mind suddenly closes. What ? Is that it ? That felt so violent. I'm back in my normal reality. How can it be ? It's 10 am. I should still be tripping. In hindsight, i was definitely still under the influence. But my coherent monologue reappeared.\n\nAnother wave is pushing. Not as intense as the precedent ones, but still a strong psychedelia.\nI put back my earbuds. Once Upon The Sea Of Blissful Awareness starts playing.\nI feel sensual. Everything around me feel sensual. Touching a tree is like touching a warm being. the dried earth on my hands feel sensual. The music definitely feels sensual. Every muscle in my body is relaxed. I stay in this state for the rest of the song. I feel alone. I wish i had someone to share this moment with.\nAfter that, i think about how influencable one can be on psychedelics. How the music directly influenced everything. Did Postford intentionally crafted his music to be listened when tripping ? Did he had specific things he wanted the tripper to feel ? Are his albums \"his\" way of what a psychedelic trip is ? His world ? Or did he just put his best intentions, and the molecule did all the work ? \nI think about how terrible it would be to be around a shitty person when tripping. \n\nI look at every small things like a child from another dimension. The intensity definitely slows down. The flute solo at the end of Around the World in a Tea Daze is innefably beautiful. It tells me that my trip here is coming to an end. That i am welcome to come back if i want it. This dimension is mine, and it will stay the same. I make the decision to come back alone in a few years. If i find people i trust enough to trip with, i will definitely come back before that. Alone, that's something else. \n\nI stay in the forest for some time. Breathing and morphing are definitely still there, and my mind is slowly coming back together. I start to realize what just happened. How intense that was. How surreal that experience felt. Also how strongly real it felt.\n\nGoing back to the civilisation was not something i planned for. Taking the bus whas not an option, i was still kinda trippy. So i walked 2 hours home. The city was not welcoming. I hated every step i had to take to get home. I wish i could have stayed in this forest forever. But is that living ?\n\n\nToday, i woke up fresh. All of my leg muscles hurt, walking my dog was nice however. I felt the best since a few years. Writing this TR brought back a lot of anxious feelings. It's already hard to remind myself that this experience is not just a weird dream.

Phenethylamines are another level up, with even more stimulation, a headspace I like to call \"psychedelic speed\", and a need to communicate.\n\nHas anyone mixed a little of all 3 classes? Is the headspace very different?

Some parts were amazing and some were horrifying. I\u2019ll say by my setting was not great because I was unaware that a group of drunken people would be returning to our apartment after being at Mardi Gras. I did 2 blotters of lsd (don\u2019t know potency), hit of mescaline, mdma, and 2ce along with some weed throughout. It was indescribable and there\u2019s only a few details I remember specifically. One friend that came back from Mardi Gras had one of those cheap \u201clightsaber\u201d sword things. He came in swinging it unknowing what we were experiencing and the light trails from it stayed in the \u201cair\u201d for so long I began to think I\u2019d never come back. For some reason...don\u2019t know if I asked or if he did it on his own but he held the saber parallel to the ground and from about 6\u201d away from my body he \u201cscanned\u201d me. I had to stop him halfway because it felt like the light from it was boiling my skin and I could tell exactly where he was holding it despite my eyes being closed until I told him to stop. Ended up going in to the bedroom with my 2 buddies that were tripping in total darkness while a party raged in the rest of the apartment. Eventually after all substances had peaked i ventured out without my other tripping buddies and joined the party. It got to be too much so I went on the back porch and a couple buddies of mine played some acoustic guitar while I lay in the grass looking at the stars, which was the most amazing feeling.

Instead of seeing fractals or melting/fluid environments, i see tons of flashing images and space distortion that doesnt really exist. It can still be geometric, but these visuals ultimately are not fractals, and tend to resemble traditional \"minds eye\" visual hallucinations.\n\nIf you add a small amount of a serotonin psychedelic (~10-15mg aco-dmt max), the visuals become some of the most beautiful i have ever seen. You get the fractals of the psychedelic + the fast moving imagery of disso visuals. \n\nIf youre going to combine them, remember that its really easy to overdo it. Take the dissos first. Take more dissos than psychedelics, but lower your doses of either to about 70% what you would normally take\n\nDoubble edit:\n\nSome PCP compounds, while being sedatives, are have DRI activity and as such, have a stimulating element to them.

I\u2019d say this is the Vyvance of pyro\u2019s and that it\u2019s a good stim in its own right but no a-pvp/a-php replacement as it lacked  the insane rush and craving but as a stim as a whole nasal in low doses is functional for a pyro or cath and feels just fine least compulsion that way and vaped is just pure recreational as I noticed mild thought clouding do the the euphoria and one dimensional stimulation but was a pleasant time and I could control the dosing fairly well, like there was 10 minutes where I\u2019d want more on the vaped come down but if I destructed myself it\u2019s pass and I could pick it up and put it down with will. Would say 3-4 hours after last dose I could sleep and wake up with no negative effects now that seems to be different with massive multi gram binges but if kept up to it under 250-300mg in a day (12-16 hours it shouldn\u2019t be harder to come off than a Dexedrine binge of a similar intensity actually nasal had less come down than nasal Dexedrine by 30-50%. I\u2019ve only tried a-pcyp several times and have mixed it with other chems such as Vyvance and 3meow so that may play into my overall opinion but in my 2 experience with it solo it felt pretty similar to ass described maybe a bit more one demensional and a bit less euphoric than mixed with amps or 3meow but a solid 7/10 in my book comparing it to other RC stims. (Compared to all stims maybe 6.25-6.5/10) worth trying for those who like smoother stims like Dexedrine yet want something shorter and quasi-legal that can be bought online without use of the DNM in my opinion.

But if ur looking for a stronger more recreational Dexedrine but with 2/3 the duration or less when vaped yet especially when done intranasl matches the cleanliness and is only slightly less functional while a bit more euphoric I think it\u2019s one to try but maybe just pick up 500mg-1g and no more until you see how it all guess and how you like it or not.", "replies": {}}}}, "fcsp43z": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/eipghd/what_molecule_do_you_recommand_to_remplace_speed/fcsp43z/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1577950355.0, "body": "Speed as in what?

I also experienced some things I didn't read anywhere else and didn't experience things many others mentioned.\n\nRecently ordered some 3MMC and 2-CB-FLY and the vendor sent 10g of 4-FMA along with it for free for some reason. Well hell, I'm not one to say no to free drugs. So I read up on it and it sounded like something I wouldn't really do, because it was more like speed than MDMA and I particularly like the MDMA euphoria. But you don't know what it's like until you try it. So I decided to bring it along to a weekend holiday with some friends.\n\nMy first mistake was not weighing doses at home, because at the location there was no way of accurately weighing it and I'd probably be drinking when I'd take it. At 1AM I took my first dose, eyeballed a bump on a key and dissolved it in about 400ml of water. I only take drugs orally. Tried drinking it slowly, but it was so bitter I just chugged it to be done with it.\n\nOne hour later I felt nothing. I'm a big guy, 150kg, and I know from plenty previous experiences with MDMA and 3MMC that I need more and that it can take a while to hit. It has taken 1,5 hours before the first effects of MDMA appeared on numerous occasions. So I'm cautious with upping the dose too early, but I had taken an, in my mind, small dose the first time. Got more water and added a slightly bigger bump and chugged it.\n\nIt was my first time taking it, so I was looking for signs that it started working. So I would also be able to identify them in the future. At 2:30AM I started noticing the first signs, but they were mild. Started talking more and sweating a little. At 3:30AM it had not improved so I said fuck it and chucked a lot of the stuff in a glass of water straight from the 10g baggie. My friends were doing coke and I wanted to keep up, so yeah.\n\nNot soon after it started working. More sociable, talkative, understanding, sweating a lot, uncontrollable jaw, basically the same as MDMA except no euphoria and much more clear, focused and calm I would say. We were also just sitting and talking, it wasn't a party vibe. Noticed short bursts of blurry vision a few times, lasting for just an instant. Walking felt a bit odd, but it wasn't difficult or weird. The effects didn't increase and weren't overwhelming, I also expected more euphoria.\n\nAt 6AM we decided to head into bed, but I knew that was going to be a challenge. I laid down, but in my earbuds and closed my eyes and listened to the music. Music was heavenly, maybe even more of an enhanced experience than with MDMA. I listened to every type of music and loved it, but on MDMA I usually only like very specific stuff. Not much later I started to get closed eyes visuals. Did not expect those, but it was a really pleasant surprise. I felt like a little truffle trip. My mind drifted while I listened to the music and I was thinking about friends I hadn't talked to in a while and that I would contact them the next day, what to say to them and wanting to meet up. It was really nice.\nEDIT: I forgot to write about the body feel. As I hit the bed it felt like I was lying down on a treadmill and the bed was pushing me towards the foot end of the bed. That quickly subsided and when I lay on my back my body got really light, especially my legs. My physical body seemed to kind of disappear as I got lost in my thoughts and I sometimes had to  move my legs or toes to ground myself again. \n\nBut sleep wasn't going to happen. Five hours literally flew by and around 11AM I got out of bed. Not really tired, but of course you know and can feel that your body and mind actually need sleep. I can always sleep easily after using MDMA or 3MMC, so I didn't expect this. However I did not feel bad and honestly haven't suffered from it. I did notice that the 4-FMA was also still working as I had plenty of energy too and I felt like partying haha.\n\nSo some of \"negative\" effects first occurred around 9AM when some people started waking up. I thought I heard footsteps all the time and was slightly paranoid maybe friends would come in my room and mess with me or whatever. Chuck water on you so you get out of bed. Usual messing around when you go somewhere with guy friends. So every time I thought I heard something I took out my earbuds and looked up, but of course no one was ever there. These were the first auditory hallucinations and slight feelings of paranoia. Really nothing bad, found it a little funny cause it was so dumb.\n\nCame home earlier today and just turned on the TV and stayed there. Noticed sounds from the TV were also different than usual. Like sounds streams were seperated and coming from different directions, which I weird because I have no surround sound. Also whatever, no biggie.\n\nThis stuff also really decreases the appetite. I went 20 hrs without food and just forced myself to eat a kebab from around the corner (my usual hangover food). Tasted like nothing, changed nothing. Ate like two hotdogs later and that was it.\n\nBut the most annoying part of it all, it is now 3:20AM, I've gone 42 hours without sleep and I'm still not confident that I'll be able to sleep well. Luckily I don't have to get up early, but dang this stuff keeps you awake (and energized). EDIT: forgot  to mention the jaw clenching lasted all day and is just now starting to get sore. \n\nI honestly don't know, but I probably did somewhere between 300 and 500mg (keep in mind I weigh 150kgs) which is way too much and I'll be weighing this stuff in the future for sure. But honestly the only real downside for me is being awake this long. Makes it a very impractical drug for recreational use for me personally and I won't use it anytime soon. Haven't noticed a bad come down and bad or depression feelings so far. \n\nThanks for reading, I'm sure I forgot to write down some details. So let me know if there's anything you want to know.\n\nUPDATE:\nJust woke up after sleeping for four hours, feel fine, glad I was able to sleep a little. Before I fell asleep I actually saw patterns, people and animals on the white walls of my bedroom. They seemed to be 3D as well and moved, weird and cool at the same time, but again, don't really want a drug to be active this long.", "author": "MarsAlien77", "score": 14, "flair": null, "created": 1597656573.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/ib4tfb/overdosed_on_my_first_4fma_trip_like_an_idiot/", "num_comments": 17, "title": "Overdosed on my first 4-FMA trip like an idiot.", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"g1spb8m": {"score": 9, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ib4tfb/overdosed_on_my_first_4fma_trip_like_an_idiot/g1spb8m/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597659366.0, "body": "just sounds like regular negative side effects from methamphetamine + not sleeping, really .

A within-subject study was performed to characterize the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of oral cocaine. Fourteen healthy inpatient participants (six males) with current histories of cocaine use were administered two oral doses (100 and 200 mg) and one intravenous (IV) dose (40 mg) of cocaine during three separate dosing sessions. Plasma samples were collected for up to 24 h after dosing and analyzed for cocaine and metabolites by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by non-compartmental analysis, and a two-factor model was used to assess for dose and sex differences. The mean \u00b1 SEM oral cocaine bioavailability was 0.32 \u00b1 0.04 after 100 and 0.45 \u00b1 0.06 after 200 mg oral cocaine. Volume of distribution (Vd) and clearance (CL) were both greatest after 100 mg oral (Vd = 4.2 L/kg; CL = 116.2 mL/\\[min kg\\]) compared to 200 mg oral (Vd = 2.9 L/kg; CL = 87.5 mL/\\[min kg\\]) and 40 mg IV (Vd = 1.3 L/kg; CL = 32.7 mL/\\[min kg\\]). Oral cocaine area-under-thecurve (AUC) and peak concentration increased in a dose-related manner. AUC metabolite-to-parent ratios of benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester were significantly higher after oral compared to IV administration and highest after the lower oral dose. In addition, minor metabolites were detected in higher concentrations after oral compared to IV cocaine. Oral cocaine produced a pharmacokinetic profile different from IV cocaine, which appears as a rightward and downward shift in the concentration\u2013time profile.

You might need to take more to get the same results as me. Maybe you should also adjust the dosage of NOOPEPT to your own liking.\n\nCaution: I suck at writing trip reports, so forgive me if anything i write doesnt really add up or is incoherent.\n\n# Now to the trip report itself:\n\nOn Friday, December 20th 2019 i decided to give this combination a go. I woke up at around 10:20am and took a tenth of a 1P-LSD tab at 10:30. Right after I swallowed the piece of paper I proceeded to weigh out 20mg of NOOPEPT (which is my normal dose I found to be optimal for productivity and memory enhancement) and consumed it sublingually. It took around 10 minutes to completely dissolve and I drank a glass of OJ to get the taste out of my mouth.\n\nI then took a shower and got upstairs to make myself some breakfast. At this point it was around 11:10am. At this point I started to feel the normal effects of the LSD microdose which was mostly a very jittery body feeling. I also made myself a coffee I drank over the course of 30 minutes. At 11:35 I went downstairs to play on my PS. At this point I had definitely some noticeable effects which included a feeling of \u201cexcess energy\u201d (like my battery was at 130% instead of 100%) plus the \u201csticky headspace\u201d from the LSD (very hard to describe, especially present when walking around, like your consciousness is still sticking to the position you were at 1 second before). I played some Titanfall 2 for about an hour until I couldn\u2019t hold my energy together anymore and I HAD to do something that would allow me to physically tire myself.\n\nIt was around 12:40 now and the amount of energy I had was absolutely crazy. I felt intense motivation to do SOMETHING as long as it would allow me to use my energy. So I decided to clean the house. And it was fun I tell you. Had my headphones on, listened to music and cleaned and sorted everything I could find. Started with the bathroom, continued with my room and went to the kitchen. At this point it was something like 12:55 and I was fucking amazed at how little time had passed and how much i was able to do in this short amount of time. Time definitely felt as if it was going slower but at the same time i was able to be much faster than usual. Took me another 20 minutes to empty the dishwasher, clean the tables, kitchen surfaces and the stove, scrub the pans clean, vacuum and mop the floor. I\u2019ve never taken speed but this is how I imagine it to feel like. Also had a very big need to socialize (I have a pretty extrovert personality when I\u2019m sober but this was again a new level), was making plans for the weekend and shit.\n\nAt 13:30 I took another 20mg of NOOPEPT and drank another cup of coffee. I was again amazed at how little time had passed and how much I was able to do in such a short amount of time. I was sitting in the living room vibing to my music and thought about what i should be doing next and it gradually felt like the \"speedy\" feeling vanished and a very \"content\"/\"clear\" feeling replaced it. Played some more Titanfall for another hour or so until the postman arrived.\n\nA few days ago i had ordered some Bristol Paper to draw on and it came at exactly the right time. I got immediatly to work and started drawing the christmas present for parents ([Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/ee5t17/finally_finished_it_hope_you_like_it_as_much_as_i/) it is if you are interested). Was working on that for another 2.5 hours completely immersed in the process of making art. After that i got picked up by some friends to atttend a class-meeting (we're all finishing school this year and this was the last time all of our class came together to eat, drink and talk about the olden days). I was very social throughout the evening. Felt kinda tired at 10pm and at around that time some friends went home and i decided to go with them. After i got home i decided to take some 2F-DCK and get myself nice and wonky.\n\nSo yeah, that is my report on the combination of LSD and NOOPEPT. I can definitely recommend it. Had no negative side effects, except suppression of appetite and feeling tired a little earlier than normal. This will definitely be my go-to substance combination if i have a day free and want to do something creative or physically active. I think going on a hike while under the influence of both of these substances would be pretty great, so that is on top of my list for now.\n\n# If you got any questions, be sure to ask :D Safe travels, my friends!", "author": "neonschwarzerblock", "score": 24, "flair": null, "created": 1577322845.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/efiyor/lsd_and_noopept/", "num_comments": 17, "title": "LSD and NOOPEPT", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fc0y775": {"score": 8, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/efiyor/lsd_and_noopept/fc0y775/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1577331693.0, "body": "Just a word of caution for people reading this, the potentiation between psychedelics and racetams/noopept can become extreme and uncomfortable at full doses.

First of all they dont want me to quit. The doc told me it would be better to stay on 15-20mg methadone instead of completely quitting but I told her I strongly disagree. She mentioned I might start using again and I told her I'd switch using morphine twice a month for waking up sick and being fucked with and lied to by doctors and your support every day.. \n\nMax amount I could lower my methadone dose was 10mg, but when my ex OD'd on my bday I came in a shock as u might imagine and the nurse told me to go give blood, that she wont give me methadone before that. What? I told her it's wrong day to screw with me, but she repeated herself.so I went to the lab, gave blood came back and told her give me this fucking methadone now and she said well first you gotta talk to a doc. (when I need a doc I need to wait on my doc, but when they want to talk to you any doc will do). I told the doc what happened, I assured her I'm not on drugs or trying to kill myself, I just want to take my medicine and go home to mourn, but she kept saying she doesn't believe me, that I have to be high even tho she couldn't tell what I took. I looked different but definitely not high, so I got pissed off told her to fuck herself for fucking with me on a day like this, what kind a bitch she is and slammed the doors... On the way out a friend met me and I told him what happened and he convinced me to go back. And you know what? They lowered my dose from 90-60mg. Thats 30%. It's fucking illegal. And when I asked my doc why can they lower my dose for 30mg when I just want my medicine and go home they first of all fuck with me, then decide to make me suffer after being butthurt and my doc said that was a mistake and that it wasn't her call and all kinds of excuses....\n\nI told her please lower my dose or I'll make a scene, I'll start hanging around the clinic and harassing people so you'll have to lower it. So lower the dose before I do something stupid and we're all in deep shit. You for running a clinic the way you do (what u mean) u know exactly what I mean. I'm surprised it's the only clinic in the whole country where they make up rules, give u different dose everyday and if you want to see what they're doing they tell u to fuck off politely.. Other clinics measure out the dose infront of you and mix it with juice. To top it all my clinic uses the cheapest brand of methadone which should be administered twice a day, but they rather give doses up to 180mg. I went from30mg to 90mg because I was waking up withdrawing and I thought : \"More I take, the longer it stay in my system\" WRONG. the withdrawals only got worse.\n\nIn Switzerland if you tried detox for a specified number of times and can't get clean, they have rooms that you visit 3 times a day and they prepeare a shot of pure Bayer heroin and either you administer it or they do it for you. They have a chill out room for you to lie down for half an hour, while being observed if you might get an OD, they're there to help you. \n\nI did some research about narcotics being available to buy in pharmacies in england in 1800's and there was almost no drug addiction, but when they passed a law about needing a good reason and a refferal to buy narcotics and that's when drug use exploded. Information on how to help people is all there, if you look for it, it's just my opinion that people who could make changes don't give a fuck about anybody else but themselves.\n\nSorry for the rant", "replies": {}}}}, "fm9zlyx": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ftxw7m/substances_that_work_similarly_to_3mmc/fm9zlyx/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1585909020.0, "body": "\"it's like MDMA, coke, and speed at the same time\" Well, that's a lie.

I am very fortunate to have had a good upbringing and realise my issues pale in significance to many addicts. \n\nI've realised that I am a \"novelty seeker\", new experiences and learning new things give me a high. This makes sense looking at the sports I do and massive changes I have the urge to make in my life every 6 months! Standing still is scary.\n\nI imagine a lot of you psychonauts are similar. Pushing the boundaries \n\n I've also noticed that I no longer think about my mood in terms of happy/sad but instead I see everything as a high or a comedown. If I drive my car fast with loud music i feel high, when i hit a traffic jam my high finishes and I'm left with the \"comedown\". The problem for me with life is that these highs and lows of life are fleeting and unpredictable.\n\n I sometimes wonder if the quantity of drugs consumed has rewired my brain and made me purely hedonistic and acutely aware of my brain chemistry. I'm always looking for the next \"buzz\", i get back from work looking for sex, then beer, then food, then video games (sounds demanding I know haha). All these things to give me a short dopamine hit! This can't be a healthy way to go about things?\n\nI'm in \"lockdown\" in the UK with my girlfriend at the moment. Which has been great actually as its novel :). But I admit I've been getting high about 3 evenings a week every week. This is partly due to the extra time I have and also I'm justifying it as I need a release from being couped up the majority of the time. The drugs I've been using are speed, mephedrone, valium and recently \"worryingly\" the odd tramadol. This is all a bit sad when you consider I'm not out partying on this stuff, I'm stuck in the flat or going for a \"daily\" walk.\n\nI don't use the drugs when I'm depressed I tend to use them when I'm feeling good about something. As a treat. If you're feeling good then why not feel really good eh!\n\nI need an exit plan for all this though. My girlfriend is going to kick me out of I don't sort my self out.

(I know I\u2019m a bit young and such, but I practice strict harm reduction) \n\nMy other experiences include:\n*Stims:*\nSpeed, coke, MDMA, methylphenidate (ritalin)\n\n*Psychedelics/hallucinogens:*\nLSD, mushrooms, ketamine, 4-HO-MET, 4-HO-MiPT, 2C-B, salvia\n\n*Opiates/benzodiazepines:*\nEtizolam, kratom\n\n*Others:*\nWeed, alcohol, nitrous\n\nT: 00:00\nI took 60mg orally mixed with a shot of water, this should be just enough for a stimulating couple hours, see [psychonautwiki](https://m.psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FA) for more info about the dose range. It tasted just like regular amphetamine (speed).\n\nT: 00:30\nI don\u2019t feel much, I decided to go for a run, so I put on my headphones and play some nice early eurodance. \n\nT: 01:30 I get home after I finish my 7 km run. I don\u2019t usually run this much, my usual routine is 4 km, but I felt really motivated during the run to extend it for a bit. During the run, the music sounded quite a lot better than normally, and I felt _very_ motivated to keep running, but _not_ forced to move, as I do feel with speed, or MDMA. It was a pleasurable sensation, because I was very clearheaded, and I felt very confident that I had pretty good stamina.\n\nT: 2:00 \nAfter I got home, I drank a protein smoothie which I prepared earlier, to provide my body with the needed calories and vitamins. I felt overall very calm and clearheaded, as I mostly do after my morning run, but this time I felt it more consciously. \n\nT: 3:00\nI decided to clean up my room, as I still felt the need to do _something_, even though I didn\u2019t feel any forced stimulation. After cleaning my room, I took a shower, and enjoyed the hot water tingling my body.\n\nT: 3:30\nAfter a long shower, I hopped onto the playstation, and played some rocket league. I felt I was coming down, although even the comedown was pleasurable and calm, very unlike other substances. I didn\u2019t feel the urge to redose, and was glad that I enjoyed the substance for how long it lasted.\n\nT: 4:30\nI am now fully sober (I _feel_ fully sober, this doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not under the influence, so always wait at least a day after using any substance with things such as driving etc. I can\u2019t stress this enough!) The comedown was very gradual, and I was just as sober as before, I didn\u2019t feel depressed or anything, like I do with many other stims. I also didn\u2019t experience any muscle contractions or jaw clenching during the whole experience.\n\nT: 1 day after\nI slept well, nothing remarkable honestly, and I feel overall pretty good.\n\nConclusion:\nVery clean and clearheaded substance, I can imagine it makes for a good evening on the dance floor, (7/10) for the feeling, only downside is short duration.\nAlso very suitable for a study drug, or a \u201cclean up your house\u201d kind of drug, as I like to call it. (8/10) on this level, easy to focus, and also no forced stimulation if you check your dosage.\nThanks for reading my first trip report, I would love to hear your opinions on my report, or on the substance.", "author": "LSDateme", "score": 12, "flair": null, "created": 1589571325.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/gk7h2m/2fa_a_gentle_yet_pleasurable_substance_trip_report/", "num_comments": 14, "title": "2-FA: A gentle, yet pleasurable substance (Trip Report)", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fqpdaih": {"score": 6, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gk7h2m/2fa_a_gentle_yet_pleasurable_substance_trip_report/fqpdaih/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1589572046.0, "body": "I wish i was that strict with harm reduction when i was 18 :)", "replies": {"fqpe8gi": {"score": 5, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gk7h2m/2fa_a_gentle_yet_pleasurable_substance_trip_report/fqpe8gi/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1589572838.0, "body": "Hahah, I think everyone fucked up at least once their lives.

Time really slowed down, with sparkly-ness, interesting, and yet there was a touch of sadness. The intense visuals held the scene, and there was the compulsion to talk and to interact and to share stuff, but the erotic was not to be found. I slept OK but there was something uncomfortable at a deep level. Am OK.\" \n\n(with 15 mg phosphate ester, orally) \"It is meaningful to say that I ceased to exist, becoming immersed in the ground of Being, in Brahman, in God, in 'nothingness,' in Ultimate Reality, or in some similar religious symbol for oneness. The feelings I experienced could best be described as cosmic tenderness, infinite love, penetrating peace, eternal blessing and unconditional acceptance on one hand and, on the other, as unspeakable awe, overflowing joy, primeval humility, inexpressible gratitude and boundless devotion. Yet, all of these words are hopelessly inadequate and can do little more than meekly point toward the genuine, inexpressible feelings actually experienced. It is misleading even to use the words, 'I experienced,' as during the peak of the experience (which must have lasted at least an hour) there was no duality between myself and what I experienced. Rather, I was these feelings, or ceased to be in them and felt no loss at the cessation. Four days after the experience itself, I continue to feel a deep sense of awe and reverence, and am simultaneously intoxicated with an ecstatic joy. This euphoric feeling is in no sense analogous to hebephrenic giddiness; it includes elements of profound peace and steadfastness, surging like a spring from a depth of my being which has rarely, if ever, been tapped prior to the drug experience.\" \n\n(with 20 mg orally indolol) \"I felt this faster than psilocin, but being twenty mg this is probably less potent.\" \n\n(with 20 mg acetate ester, orally) \"A mild stomach discomfort for twenty minutes, followed by intoxication to the 40 minute point.

Nothing much.\" \n\n(with 12 mg, orally) \"It was just an hour ago that I swallowed the capsule, and everything is happening. I was completely developed at 45 minutes. The imagery with my eyes closed is vivid. The music is exceptionally sensual. I notice a tendency to twitch but it doesn't bother me. Everything is rolling -- how can they allow an erotic piece like the Saint Sa\u00ebns second piano concerto to ever appear in public, let alone over the radio? A very rapid decline between the third and fourth hour. A rich day for love, insights, fantasy and for retreating into one's mind. A rich day for discovery.\" \n\n(with 12 mg, orally) \"I suspended the solids in water, and a drop of HCl put it into solution immediately. The first awareness was unmistakable at twenty minutes, and from there it was a rapid and noisy development ending at about an hour. But this lasted for only another 40 minutes, and then dropped off quite rapidly. The erotic was excellent, but there were few visuals and I had difficulty connecting fantasy to music. Good appetite afterwards, and I had no trouble getting to sleep.\" \n\n(with 15 mg acetate ester, orally) \"An interesting mixture of intoxication and sedation, progressing to a very relaxed state with some motor incoordination. Just a little bit like alcohol or GHB. There was no drifting of thoughts nor any gut disturbance at any time, although I wasn't very hungry. Conversation was easy.\" \n\n(with 20 mg, orally) \"Early signs (muscle sensations) were noticed in 10 minutes. In another 10 minutes a rapid heightening of all senses ensued, reaching a plateau in 40 minutes and beginning to decline in 3 hours with a return to near normal in 5-6 hours. The intensity of the experience is marked. At the plateau, communication (verbal) is difficult with intense alteration in the sense of time and distance. Multiple and overlapping wave forms occur with an extremely intense color alteration. Drifting in and out of the body is common with an increased sense of body processes, i.e., blood flow in vessels. Muscular sense is increased and a feeling of soaring in bodiless flight is experienced. A mild vertigo was felt with attempted walking but is not associated with nausea. Some anxiety was experienced initially, but could be interpreted as a reaction to the extremely powerful onset. A curious, probably idiosyncratic effect, was of possessing the essence of sexual power associated with being a large jungle cat. The idea was prominent for some time. Conservatively, this compound is at least twice as active as psilocin at comparable doses, in terms of plateau or peak effect. External stimuli, especially light, were distracting to the point of annoyance. Sounds can be seen, words explode into showers of bright points with eyes closed. Other eyes-closed imagery is prominent with patterns (in color); at times soaring clouds dominate the eyes-closed scenery. I cannot overemphasize the intensity of the experience. I would not want to go much higher than 20 milligrams (50 milligrams of psilocin is not as intense).\" \n\n(with 30 mg acetate ester, orally) \"It was as if I had downed a few martinis in a hurry -- except that there were eye-closed visuals in a lot of different colors, especially metallic greens. I had jaw clenching and a body tremor, reminding me of ecstasy except is was not in any way stimulated. I listened to music in front of a fireplace in a darkened room and I saw bright colorful unstructured patterns.

Each weed had special significance, and my cat Ms. joined me and agreed with me. This is excessively strange. The radio was discussing a President Ford fund-raiser, and continued with word sequences such as fund, fun, profun, profound, profane, refrain, and on and on. A car drove by with sitar music playing on its radio! Why not. And by my hour number three, I am back where I started. That was quite a morning.\" \n\n*(with 6 mg, orally)* \"Talking wasn't really interesting, music wasn't interesting, nothing was very interesting. One hour in and I felt turned on as if a wave passed over my body, and then the wave went back to the ocean, or wherever waves go. I was getting hungry but I didn't want to go to the kitchen, as I didn't want to interact with anyone I might encounter. What remains with me the longest was the awareness of vibrations, and what felt best was the stillness. Was back to baseline in 4 hours.\" \n\n*(with 7 mg, orally)* \"In one hour I was in a marvelous, sexy place. Everything was shaded with eroticism. Sex was explosive, and in another three hours I was completely ready for the outside, public world.

I am not completely sure I like it.\" \n\n*(with 10 mg, orally)* \"We found it to be outstanding -- combining the best characteristics of two other like products while contributing a penetrating efficaciousness of its own.\" \n\n*(with 12 mg, orally)* \"Had prepared for this experience during the day, and was looking forward to the time with my partner. Flowers, candles, fluffy pillows, arranged for food, etc. Large pillar type candles and the glow was nice and warm. Warm was comfort and comfort was good. Warm led into a wonderful sexual turn on, where my entire body was alive and alert. This was one hour into the trip. This wonderful sexual turn on was the feeling of a bud about to unfold into a full-blown beautiful flower, which happened during love making. The flower continued to fill out fuller and fuller for a couple of hours, and then just remained a full-blown beautiful wonderful flower, and I fell asleep with this feeling.\"\n\n*(with 12 mg, orally)* \"Remembering how hungry I got during my last 6 mg. experience and without any dietary restriction I ate a vegetarian burrito four hours earlier. It took an hour for me to turn on. I have never experienced such an increase of the peristalsis process in moving the burrito through my colon and with each defecation I would become a little more turned on. As I became more turned on the greater I felt the sense of hypertension. A mind / body load became uncomfortable. It was never psychedelic in the way of acid or psilocybe. My muscles, gluteus maximus, the lateral rotators that connect to the trochanter and the large muscles that connect to the hamstrings, all contracted and spasmed. Psychologically it was as though my conservative instinct, my sense of Being, became extremely agitated. I felt completely unnerved, with the only relief offered was by having sex. As the effects of this material were rather extreme, I never felt as though I was having a psychedelic experience. Maybe because it was all about dealing with body load and discomfort.\" \n\n*(with 12 mg, orally)* \"There was a very strange, almost paranoid session of listening to music, about an hour and a half into it. The program was a program of Irish music called \"The Thistle and Shamrock\" but I had paid no attention to the announcement. What was being played were three nativity pieces with song and words, from strange places. What I heard were three distant, fraudulent selections with generically meaningless words, mumbled so as to sound authentic. Everything was faked. It was \"hearts of space\" music in the worst possible taste. My neutral observer was completely taken in by it all, and quite enjoyed it. It turned out that I was wrong, the music was strange but of good quality. It was my interpretation that was screwed up.\"\n\n*(with 12 mg, orally)* \"My experience with this material was different in its action than anything I had tried in the past -- it came on quicker but with much less intensity. I really enjoyed the mellowness, and it sort of waved in and out. I came down after almost an hour, smoked a little marijuana, and went back up to where I had been previously. I could do this around my children, and they would know I was happy but doubted they would realize just exactly what was up. I liked it and would consider a public event (craft fair, street fair, window shopping) very adventurous. No hangover; sleep excellent.\" \n\n*(with 12 mg, orally)* \"Awful, awful taste. Quickly aware and in the second half hour I rapidly shot up to a +++ in a very LSD-like manner, without the visuals. Time was quite slowed down during this come-on.

I peaked at 2 or three minutes. It was quite intense, but not the max of DMT at 30 milligrams and no sensory close-out. Slight nausea on the drop-off -- I am glad I had not eaten anything. Overall comparison to DMT, more potent, slightly faster, but like DMT is largely a simple, stoning drug with no sensory contribution, no intellectual contribution. It's greatest contribution might be to provide a subject the vocabulary of an altered state of consciousness so that, with interesting and constructive drugs, these effects will be familiar, and thus not distractions.\" \n\n*(with 8 mg, smoked)* \"I was blown away, far away I might add, but only for 10 minutes and effects were gone by half an hour. During this episode mental activity was almost absent. I can't say I wasn't 'impressed' in some way, though it wasn't exactly what I expected. I had read reports with statements varying from 'dwarfs + elves' to 'conk on the head,' the latter of which relates more closely to my experience.\" \n\n*(with perhaps 10 mg, smoked)* \"Onset was gentle, perhaps over 15 minutes. I felt like all of my blood had turned to concrete. There were no noticeable visual effects, but my hearing was slightly diminished. The whole experience was over after 1 hour.\" \n\n*(with perhaps 15 mg, smoked)* \"I took a hit from the pipe with five-methoxy in it, and after the 8 to 10 seconds it took to carry the chemical to my brain I remember starting to fall over from my sitting position. My normal physical perceptions dissolved away from my awareness. My ears started to ring and I started to float off. I was acutely aware of a certain resonation of my aural perception, an electrical buzzing that fluctuated in synch with my visual perception. What I saw can only be described as a fantastically subtle multicolored phosphene, completely filling every area visually available. I say it in this way because I was simultaneously losing contact with my body, I could not tell if my eyes were open or shut, although I initially had the feeling that they were darting back and forth, from side to side. These feelings and sensations built up in intensity very quickly, a matter of seconds: I can remember this feeling of building intensity up to a point, and then I was not there in my body or in time. In the 10 to 15 minutes that my body was under the influence of the drug my mind was completely referenceless, there was no way for my consciousness to limit or gauge the stimuli my being was barraged with. I remember switching to a perception where the endless and intricate phosphene was love and the energy of light. I called upon those forces within my being to realign and submit, to let go of all the cogent fears and just exist ... and that innate decision saved me a lot of psychic damage. What is most outstanding about the way it feels is an inability to judge in any way, by any method of the mind ... it is unconquerable, as deep and profound as a totally unconditional love that is life. What a trip, huh?\" \n\n*(with 15 mg, smoked)* \"At about 60 seconds after I smoked this free base, I beheld every thought that was going on everywhere in the universe and all possible realities while I was wracked out with this horrible ruthless love. It scared the hell out of me. When I could see again (15 minutes later) it was almost as if there was an echo of a thought in my head saying that I was given an extremely rare look at the true consciousness of it all. I've never been hit this hard since then. A definite ++++.\" \n\n*(with perhaps 20 mg, smoked)* \"This is a very strong hallucinogen. A twenty minute experience. For me it was like adding the MDMA experience to DMT. DMT for me is terrifying (I still go back though) and I must really think about it before proceeding. The 5-MeO-DMT was much more relaxed, a kind of cosmic consciousness type of experience. I broke into a space similar to DMT but it was more like receiving grace. I felt a little shaky (tremor-like) coming down.\" \n\n*(with 25 mg, smoked)* \"I placed 25 mg of 5-methoxy-DMT in a stainless steel one-quarter teaspoon and vaporized it over a cigarette lighter collecting the smoke in an upside-down funnel. All smoke was inhaled; the taste was mild -- none of the plastic taste of DMT. About 10 seconds or so after inhaling the last of the smoke, it began with a fast-rising sense of excitement and wonder, with an undertone of \"Now you've done it,\" but dominated by a sense of, \"WOW, This Is IT!\" There was a tremendous sense of speed and acceleration In perhaps 10 more seconds these feelings built to an intensity I had never experienced before. The entire universe imploded through my consciousness. It's as if the mind is capable of experiencing a very large number of objects, situations and feelings, but normally perceives them only one at a time. I felt that my mind was perceiving them all at once. There was no distance, no possibility of examining the experience. This was simply the most intense experience possible; a singularity, a white-out (as opposed to a black out), I have little memory of the state itself. I have no memory, for example, of whether my eyes were opened or closed. After some seconds or minutes , it started to fade and came to resemble a merely intense psychedelic state. Here I had the feeling, a visualization of being part of the universe of beings, all active in our daily, interwoven tasks, still moving at an incredible rate, and with a longing for a single group / organism awareness and transcendence. In a few more minutes it faded to an alert (+ one) state with an additional sense of awe and wonder, relief, and a strong feeling of gratitude toward the universe in general, for the experience.\" \n\n*(with 30 mg, smoking)* \"I placed approx. 30 mg of 5-MeO into a pipe, and smoked it, in one toke, without a second thought. An instant later, I was crawled up on my bed (in the fetal position) with my eyes closed, squirming around, screaming (in my head) 'Fuck! You killed yourself!' I repeated this several times, very fearful of death. I didn't see anything, while my eyes were shut, except for a bright white light, that which you see after staring at a bright light. The only other \"vision\" was one in my mind - I came to the realization that my life would be wasted if I died there. This showed me all of my scripts being discarded and nothing good happening ever again. It was a glimpse into my future, if I died. I concentrated on breathing and that helped me survive (mentally). I walked into the living room and placed a CD into the stereo, and as the first song started, my attention span disappeared, and I walked back into my bedroom. To my surprise, forty minutes had passed, in what I remembered as mere seconds. This scared me, thinking that maybe I had blacked out. I felt the effect for about an hour, it slowly faded away.\" \n\n*(with an unknown but large amount, smoked)* I observed the subject pass very quickly into an almost coma-like state. Within seconds his face became purple and his breathing stopped. I pounded his chest, and breathed for him, and he seemed to emerge in consciousness, with the comment, \"This is absolute ecstasy.\" He stopped breathing a second time, and both heart massage and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation was provided. Again, he recovered and managed to maintain a continuing consciousness and achieve a partial recovery. In the awake condition he was increasingly lucid, but on closing his eyes he became possessed with, what he called, \"The energy of terror.\" He could not sleep, as upon closing his eyes he felt threatened in a way he could not tolerate.

While I could have carried on a conversation about anything and didn't feel the least bit stoned, I found the feeling very recognizable.\" \n\n*(with 0.7 mg, i.v.):* \"This was basically a +1 experience. After a few instances I felt its motion, very gentle waves. I was thinking about thinking about the experience, about writing about it, and so I was experiencing myself as both observer and editor. This was not overwhelming, but gentle.\" \n\n*(with 1.3 mg, i.v.)* \"In a few seconds I was participating in exquisite, full body, teeth-chattering shivers that lasted in all about 10 minutes, nearly the duration of the effects.

I thought I was an ocean. I don't remember where I first lost continuity of consciousness (this is a little like a blackout from hard liquor) but I remember being aware of the sounds I was making apparently some time after I began vocalizing. Around the time I thought to change these sounds as I pleased, I also noted with brief wonder that the sound was continuous, not changed by my breathing. I sang my way back.\" \n\n*(with 3.1 mg, i.v.)* \"I vocalized effortlessly. I was getting in touch with my body. I said, 'Turn off the lights,' and 'I love you,' and then I lost it. I was amazed later to find a roomful of people who had been frightened by the noises they had been amazed to hear, and I was amazed to be told I had made.\" \n\n\n**5-meo-mipt:**\n\nDOSAGE : 4 - 6 mg, orally; 12 - 20 mg, smoked\n\nDURATION : 4 - 6 hrs \n\nQUALITATIVE COMMENTS: \n\n(with 1.5 mg, orally) \"In 15 minutes I was already off of baseline, and by an hour it is unquestionably real. There is no visualization to music, but a general turnedon randiness. Dropping at an hour and a half, and out by three hours. Modest but real.\" \n\n(with 4 mg, orally) \"Up very fast, to a +2 in an hour. Absolutely no visuals, but over the next two hours an ease of interpretive fantasy, almost dream-like, and easy eroticism. Food tasted marvelous, but there was no appetite. Easy, normal sleep and good spirits in the AM.\" \n\n(with 5 mg, orally) \"Extremely bitter taste. Some stimulation and tingling at 10 minutes, and I am apprehensive at this rapid onset. There are no visual symptoms at all, but the stimulation of conceptual thought is intense. Depth perception is slightly altered and a very minor wave pattern can be noticed in the peripheral vision, but no major object or color distortion. Minor enhancement of auditory acuity. Philosophical concepts about this and other substances seem important. I wonder what the value of writing about, or attempting to describe, their effects really is. At the second hour, the effects are subsiding, and for another three hours there are tailings and insomnia, but I am able to eat normally. There is a certain amount of 'negativity' about this compound. The dose is satisfyingly small, but I wonder if it is worth it. Somewhat of a disappointment. Have no desire to experiment further.\"\n\n(with 6 mg, orally) \"Rapid development to 45 minutes, some shakes, uneven handwriting, and hints of time slowing. Extremely erotic. Full plateau at a +3 at the 2 1/2 hr. point, then a graceful and rather rapid drop. Easy, restful sleep. Absolutely no visuals or related sensory effects -- what does one call this stoned state? Very pleasant, music extremely acceptable, tactile extraordinary. I feel that higher dosages would not contribute anything more.\" \n\n(with 12 mg, smoked) \"I was able to take 4 or 5 puffs, and to hold off the onset until then, then I couldn't anymore. Powerful, tremendous rush, but all along maintaining body-ego awareness, unlike 5-MeO-DMT where the world appears to utterly dissolve. I was aware of doing a lot of groaning, writhing, shaking around; headphones and eyeshades kept it completely internal. Not too much visual, but lots of disorientation. Early on there was a lot of emotional lability, laughing, crying, 'Oh God' kinds of outbursts. \"At an hour and a half, I was down enough that I tried smoking the remainder of the bowl without much additional effect. A typical psychedelic afterglow and in the morning ate a big breakfast and felt essentially normal. In summary, I took too little, I was in a bad mood, and felt myself to be in a rushed environment. The experience seemed to me like a hybrid between CZ-74 and 5- MeO-DMT; the trippiness of the former and the rush (although not as intense) of the latter.\" \n\n(with 20 mg, smoked) \"Most all of it was smoked in about three or four inhalations before I felt it coming on so strongly that I lay down. Within less than a minute after I lay down, with my eyes closed, my visual field was filled with brilliant geometric patterned lines of different colors that were slowly moving. There were several sets of parallel and curved lines superimposed upon in each other. Soon after that, probably within a minute or two, I became extremely disoriented from my normal sense of being a person in a body; I was lost in an undifferentiated mass of feeling and non-specific sensation. It was similar to the overwhelming feeling of 5-MeO-DMT in quality and, as with that material, the peak phase lasted less than 30 minutes. \"Then I began to think more coherently, but intense waves would return every 5 to 15 minutes. In between my perception and thinking would be fairly normal, but with the waves I would be swept up in imagery or memories heavily laden with emotional content. After two hours I was joined by my wife. We spent some very intimate time together, and I remember asking her who she was and she replied, 'Your wife.' This was very powerful to me since I did not really know what it meant, except that it seemed to be the best combination of mother, lover and friend, and that it was an entirely new kind of relationship that we would be creating for the rest of our lives together. \"After three or four hours, the waves had virtually stopped, and I remained oriented to the present and my immediate surroundings. I stayed under a mild influence until I ate supper, around 7 hours. I felt tired, had trouble falling asleep, but awoke refreshed.\" \n\n**amt: //**\n\n**dpt: //**\n\n**dipt: //**\n\nDOSAGE : 25 - 100 mg, orally \n\nDURATION : 6 - 8 hrs \n\nQUALITATIVE COMMENTS : \n\n(with 18 mg, orally) \"Wild effects noted in an hour. Remarkable changes in sounds heard. My wife's voice is basso, as if she had a cold -- my ears with slight pressure as if my tubes were clogged but they aren't. Radio voices are all low, music out of key. Piano sounds like a bar-room disaster. The telephone ringing sounds partly underwater. In a couple more hours, music pretty much normal again.\" \n\n(with 25 mg, orally) \"Within the first hour I noted changes already, and my hand-writing became very poor. I cannot seem to measure the rate of the drug's effects as there is no obvious window through which I am moving. Abrupt sounds have golden spikes attached to them as after-sounds, but I can't focus in on any other sensory changes. I moved into a completely quiet environment and there don't appear to be any effects of any kind. If I were deaf, this would have been an inactive compound. How many other drugs have appeared to be inactive because I didn't know where to look for effects?\" \n\n(with 50 mg, orally) \"Everything was auditory, and I can only describe it with a '!'\" \n\n(with 100 mg, orally) \"Nothing until 35 minutes when a definite change in hearing was observed. There was a decrease in high frequency acuity with an unusual tonal shift of all frequencies to a lower pitch. Voices sounded very similar to a single side-band radio signal which had been mistuned to the low side of the center frequency. All familiar sounds became foreign, including the chewing of food. No effects were noted with respect to clarity of speech, and both comprehension and interpretation were normal. Music was rendered completely disharmonious although single tones sounded normal. There were no changes in vision, taste, smell, appetite, vital signs, or motor coordination. The effects began to fade at four hours post ingestion, and were completely gone at eight hours. Mild diarrhea occurred from five to ten hours post-ingestion but was not a significant problem.\" \n\n(with 250 mg, orally) \"Shortly after I ingested the substance I heard a spirit say, 'Once in a lifetime.' She encouraged me to believe that I would have more life after the experience. But, there was a feeling of foreboding. The light was there, but DIPT was the body of Satan. The voices of people were extremely distorted -- males sounded like frogs -- children sounded like they were talking through synthesizers to imitate outer space people in science fiction movies. In fact I felt that I was somehow sent into an anti-universe where everything looked the same as normal but was a cold and empty imitation. I felt I was a fallen angel.\" \n\n(with 8 mg, smoked) \"In four minutes I was aware of things going on, and by eight minutes, I was at a plus 2. My tongue was numb, and my ears felt plugged up although my hearing was keen and there was a background hissing sound.\"\n\n\n**ept: //**\n\n**met: //**\n\n**mpt: //**\n\n**mipt: //**\n\nDOSAGE : 10 - 25 mg, orally \n\nDURATION : 3 - 4 hrs\n\nQUALITATIVE COMMENTS : \n\n(with 5 mg, orally) \"Maybe a hint towards the end of an hour. Nothing further. Slept soundly.\" \n\n(with 10 mg, orally) \"There is no question but what this is active. I felt it just a half hour after taking it, and was somewhat disappointed to see it disappear over the next couple of hours. A very good feeling, quite randy.\" \n(with 10 mg, orally) \"Definitely active, mild excitement, dry mouth, some muscle tension in the back of the neck. At 75 minutes, definitely rolling, but still no visual effects. Finally subsiding. Not unpleasant, although a feeling of restlessness persists. Tailing insomnia for 6-8 hours.\" \n(with 20 mg, orally) \"My handwriting is shot. There are almost no visuals, so why am I at a plus two? I feel very alert. Tried to sleep and ended up talking for quite a while instead The overall experience can best be described as 'mild'.\" \n\n(with 25 mg, orally) \"Quite an active dose. Same initial effects as with 10 milligrams, but considerably more excitement, central stimulation. At an hour, the effects seem to have plateaued. Enhancement of visual field, i.e., brightened colors, clearly defined objects. Definite auditory effects, and I can pick out each sound with clear definition. Very 'heady,' but still remarkably free of visual distortion. Slight mydriasis. As it subsides, there is some muscle tension in the jaws, but much milder than with MDA or even psilocin.\" \n\n(with 20 mg, by insufflation) \"Immediate onset (less than a minute) and to ++. A little dizziness. My first thought is, 'This is definitely psychedelic.' Everything looked brighter, and vision was tinted orange. Everything appeared as if under an orange overlay. No other visual changes to speak of. Skin, hearing, sensitive. All-in-all, however, sensory changes were minor. The effects on thought were more typically psychedelic. The spin-offs, tangents, and implications of different threads of thought became apparent, and I could watch them unfold with my mind's eye. These effects gradually tapered off over the next three and a half hours or so. During this time, interaction with my companions was facile, and we had a good conversation.

My thoughts seemed to be moving at normal speed, and I was thousand-yard-staring and still kind of dissociated so not paying much attention to the outside world *(as I had just recovered from a bout of simulation syndrome)* and ***they were speaking in freakin slow motion with deeeeeeeeeeeeeep voices no waaay!***\n\nSo I quickly realized that in my comedown state I was literally experiencing a state of superhuman reflexes. My mind was functional at \"normal speed\" but the entire world around me was fluctuating between 40% and about 85% normal speed erratically. Cranking my mouse sensitivity up ad absurdum, I realized that I my mouse and brain were effectively \"in sync\", and that if I compensated for my slow body I might be able to whip some tail in video games.\n\nI don't play PALADINS, and I regularly tout myself as a terrible shooter player who strongly prefers the type of skill checks required to play fighting games effectively over those which are encountered in shooters. I started off by picking Torvald, a tank with a few skillshots and a laser beam which hooks to targets if you can track them sufficiently. As I was seeing the game move in slow motion, I was playing as if it were a card game; raising my shields with perfect timing to parry most abilities sent my way, constantly hopping around without losing my laser's latch, able to aim my skillshots a bit better than usual. My account just had like 8 random ranked games as Torvald where I did not die a single time, and got MVP three times, and a bunch of losses; which I think is fucking hilarious.\n\nBy the time I got around to playing Drogoz in norms, things were moving at 85-95% normal speed.

On which she obviously respond: \u201cwhere do you need to be in such a hurry?\u201d To which I \u2018smoothly\u2019 recovered from by saying: \u201cto a friend we met with him in 30minutes\u201d. So she asks some more questions which I also respond pretty abnormal compared to normal and we leave. Now was the tricky part where I had been stressing out about all night, driving about 10km on a moped(motorbike idk) to our other friend who would join us. Of course very bad idea kids never drugs and drive, but If I can do it so can you. ;) so driving went like this: me full focus on where the road is actually going since my visuals didn\u2019t exactly help me navigate the street. We had a great time and arrived save and well. \n\nSecond drug. MDMA in pill form aka XTC, basically loved this drug and abused is af for about 4 months, then came down and felt like shit for couple weeks and was like meh I\u2019ll find something which doesn\u2019t fuck my brain chems so intensely hard not even speaking about all the other risks and then almost never touched it again.\n\nThird. Cocaine, which poly addict doesn\u2019t like cocaine or has liked it in the past. Or actually not only poly addict more like 25% of dutch adults lol (i heard this don\u2019t quote me on this) yea I was always a bit held back with cocaine. I knew if I\u2019d go on some good binges I prob wouldn\u2019t recover if you know what I mean. So I did it once a week sometimes  everyday something a month nothing. Didn\u2019t really like to go on full week 24/7 binges r smthn.\n\n20y/o did ayahuasca with me mum long story but was an amazing experience would r8 8/8. \nI already had gained allot of interest and curiosity about psychedelics beforehand and some experiences with 2cb and lsd, but also very interested about how consciousness works and all that spiritual stuff yk. Always been an open mind guy kinda seeing it all from my own perspective but accepting others as well, im just livin\u2019 my life and I don\u2019t really care about how society is going to end up I\u2019m just here to record and witness my little part of what the whole experience of the universe is. Wouldn\u2019t everyone want to know what happend? Like what happend before everything and what will happen at the end of time all those things. \n\nNow I\u2019m getting very interested in research chemicals. So many chems so many different feelings human person can experience. This has got my full interest now and thats kinda bad in most peoples eyes cuz its basically \u2018drugs\u2019 and \u2018drugs are bad\u2019 its all bad and you can\u2019t be just generously curious about it without being judged but it is kind of understandable.  \n\nSo more drugs I tried\n-N20\n-speed\n-ket\n-3.meo.pcp\n-ayahuasca (dmt)\n-etizolam\n-flunitrazolam\n-3mmc\n-dpt\n-4-ho-mipt\n-phenibut\n-idra-21\n-kratom\n-clonazolam\n-2fdck\n-salvia\n \nAll that in a year... now doing less drugs tho the past couple months only here and there.\n\nSorry for maybe posting in wrong sub if anyone has tips, questions or just wants to have a convo lemme know.\nSorry if this post is all over the place so am I", "author": "kickvdw", "score": 6, "flair": null, "created": 1586690722.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/fzp5kt/my_lifelong_drug_story_for_those_who_are/", "num_comments": 14, "title": "My lifelong drug story (for those who are interested)", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fn5eqsd": {"score": 12, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/fzp5kt/my_lifelong_drug_story_for_those_who_are/fn5eqsd/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1586691743.0, "body": "Bro coming from a guy with a developmental disorder that grew up in special ed and went to the special olympics getting passed by administration in shady ass ways.\n\nTherapy.

I went with my mother and my best friend (yes weird combo) and I was stupid enough to have expectations. As you said I hoped I would get great insights about my life, the universe, what I want to do for the rest of my life. I thought I would get those things shown to me very clearly right then and there, but ofc they didn\u2019t. Don\u2019t get me wrong it was one of the best things I\u2019ve ever done and I\u2019d recommend everyone who is mentally stable and in a good place to do it at least once in their lives. But I didn\u2019t get allot of visuals either, no clear images, no mother ayahuasca :(. It was overal a pretty light experience even though I took a pretty good amount. But compared to my best friend which I went with I always am way less sensitive to visuals and he has to take 1/4th my dose and has 10x more visuals, so that might explain that. I got allot of appreciation and love for my family and loved ones, some deep appreciation which I didn\u2019t have before. I also dealt with some bad feelings which I didn\u2019t really emotionally deal with it the time. So I thought about it real good when I took ayahuasca, this was actually relieving. The overal experience was wonderful tho all the 9 other people who you go with become kinda your friends in this 1 weekend of tripping together, you learn about their biggest secrets and what is dwelling them the most in life. I think this is beautiful and where a lot of the learning comes from to. I was 19y/o with my friend who was 18y/o and the rest of the group was 30-50 so they had full life experiences and traumas and they hoped ayahuasca could fix that. \n\nSo overal life changing experience but not as ground shaking as you sometimes hear about. I also did it in my home country and not somewhere out in the amazone, which I think plays a big part as well to the whole experience.", "replies": {}}}}}}}}}}, "gi4fjb": {"text": "Hello all, I'd like to share an experience I had with 4-AcO-DMT. I'll start by sharing the dose that sent me on a trip. This dose is more than twice the heaviest dose recommended. We took around 114-115 mg... alone... at my house... where my parents live. Dumb. I sometimes call myself we instead of I, not sure why but it feels natural. So watch out for that.\n\nMe(at the time): about 17 and 1/2 years old. Mentally unstable (due to mental illness, not related to depression) Hearing voices and seeing objects/people/animals that are not there on a regular basis... (About 3-10 major hallucinations per week). Currently taking Fluoxetine and Wellbutrin for depression and one forgotten antipsychotic that did not work well for me at the time. In addition to all of this, I have taken LSD before and I'm not sure if it is from the LSD or from my Pre-existing conditions, I experience HPPD on a daily basis, 24/7. So it is rare for me to see clearly.\n\nSet (Mindset):  Severely depressed and basically has given up on a future for oneself. Thinking wholeheartedly and with a grin \"What else do I have to lose? I've lost my body, my soul, my mind, everything. I do not know what to do anymore.\" We were very excited for this forthcoming event that was to happen no matter what. I was determined to take this chemical compound even if my house burnt down before we started. \"I\" wanted change... Now.\n\nSetting: Was at my house during summertime mid-August. My parents were home and it was around 5:30 at night. I live in the upper Midwest so the weather is fair at around 76 degrees Fahrenheit. Started in my room and moved to multiple places around the house.\n\nIf you want to skip the warnings of this report, just skip past the Brackets \"\\[...\\]\" or move to \"Initially before I started\" below.\n\n\\[WARNING!!! I made many mistakes in the adventure which could have turned horribly at any time... Please take the correct precautions when taking a new or any psychedelic compound. You can find out very quickly how overwhelming these substances can be. I will be stating my flaws throughout my story but I will try to state them here.\\]\n\n\\[--- Do not take psychedelics ALONE! (Even if you tell a friend over text or through a call, always have someone there!). I did not tell anyone what I was doing. First Mistake.\\]\n\n\\[--- Do not take more than a recommend Dose if you are not prepared, ESPECIALLY when you have never taken the substance before! You don't know what it will do to you!!! I took more the 2X the recommended heavy dose on my very first time... alone... without telling anyone... I realize how irresponsible and see how dumbfounded I am just by acknowledging this. \\]\n\n\\[--- Always test your Chemicals! I did not test my chemical before taking this... I could have taken something that was not supposed to be there and died... by myself... with my parents near by...\\]\n\nP.S. I dont want to lecture you all because I know the common knowledge of the people reading this know everything stated and would not come close to making these mistakes... One last thing though.\n\n\\[--- Know yourself... DO NOT. I CANNOT BE MORE CLEAR. DO NOT. TAKE PSYCHEDELICS WHILE NOT BEING IN THE RIGHT MINDSET! For anyone wondering... On psychedelics you can become very emotional and I mean that but 100X the regular emotion you feel on a daily basis. Being as I was, I was not in the right mind to take a psychedelic, let alone smoke weed by myself. I could have hurt myself or even worse, with no regard for anyone else. You tend to forget about others when you were as self centered as I was and you could very easily make a mistake. \\]\n\n\\[Note: On today's date, I am doing much better than I have been in the past few years and I am very grateful for that. This is due to Very Loving Friends and Family that I have to Support me in my Journey. The rest of this report is just of what I previously felt. I feel that it could possibly help some people understand more. It is a story. \\] \n\n:)\n\nInitially before I started: We planned to take around 30-45 mg of the 4-AcO-DMT around 5:00pm. I cleaned my room beforehand so I didn't have to look at a mess while tripping. I knew this would please my inner self. I didn't know when I would get my concoction, but I planned on taking it immediately. I got the stuff on a Tuesday afternoon and so it began.\n\nTHE BEGINNING:\n\n4:30 pm - the prep stage. We began in the basement of my house. The floors being split by an entrance stairwell on the ground floor with stair either leading up or down from the entrance area. In the basement, we cleaned up my computer area in my dads office. I had Rocket League running in the background and multiple web pages (7 different pages) full of informative descriptions(5 pages)  and trip reports(2 pages) of 4-AcO-DMT. I then moved to my porch area out back of my basement. I stepped out of the screened in porch and set up a chair looking out into my backyard. My backyard consists of about 15-20 feet of space before there is a wall of trees and an open water swamp that extends hundreds of feet further out with cattails littering the edges and middle area.\n\n5:00 pm - I return to my room with my intentions set and my scientific mind running wild in hopes of creating the psychedelic experience of visual and auditory hallucinations before I even take the drug. I take out my milligram scale and open the package containing the goods. I take my miniature drug shovel and dig into the bag expertly to make sure I don't spill any of the brownish crystals. We scoop once - 15 mg, We scoop twice - 23.7 mg. My brain, in a complete beastly nature turns the bag of crystals upside down and almost 1/3 of the bag falls into the small dish holding the \"Key\". I stop and stutter my hand. Knowing if we were to touch the crystals with my bare hand, it would immediately start absorbing into my skin and my dosage wouldn't be precise.\n\n5:30 pm - Grumbling about the small mess I made, the scale reads 114.68 mg....... With immense Darkness in my heart, trembling in my own skin. I feel an urge... Unconsciously lifting the small diskette holding these immaculate chemicals. We feel the Dark Red Anger fill the Endless Void in the center of my chest and with an overwhelmingly rush of a mixture of what I think Adrenaline, Dopamine, Serotonin, Epinephrine, and I believe to be Emotion... I drive the pile of chemicals to the back of my throat and swallow... With this intense ritualistic experience coming to an end, and a strange bitter taste in my mouth, I feel... Content.\n\n5:45 pm - Flushing my mouth with different types of sodas/pop, I swab my mouth to try and ease the urge to puke my guts into the bathroom sink. Upstairs, in an interesting and mild Manic episode. I rinse my mouth and then go to my kitchen sink to clean my mouth. My mother standing close does not flinch. For I take Kratom at times and do the same after consuming the Vile liquid.\n\n6:00 pm - Only being about 15-20 minutes later, I was surprised to see things... Clearly. It seems my HPPD has taken a break in its torment and had subsided for this experience. This is what I crave when taking hallucinogens, I've noted this experience in many of my psychedelic adventures.\n\n\\*Note: a lot of people including me tend to see things more clearly when taking a psychedelic, besides the innate hallucinations.\\*\n\nWe slowly started to realize that everything around us had a specific geometric shape and had a place to sit in my upstairs living room. Everything seems to be... Just Right and In Place..\n\n6:15 pm - We move downstairs to the basement and out the back onto my porch. Slowly realizing that I am getting of feeling of being higher and higher by the second. I don't feel cracked out, we feel a sense of warmth and a headiness that feels like I smoked a bowl of weed. Slightly off balance and a heightened sense of awareness, I sat in the chair I pre-planned myself to enjoy earlier that evening. I attentively look down at myself, not acknowledging the ever expanding and twisting universe around me. We note that the hairs on my arm are now twisting in an upward motion and outwards of my arm. A swirling whirlpool that seems to be grasping the air around me. I bring my arm close to my face and see the hair is now giant, like trees in a forest, I see them now, clearly.\n\n6:30 pm - \\*You begin to see my true state of mind in these next parts of the trip.\\* I sit attentively in my chair watching the trees in front of me make a mosaic. I watch these three dimensional trees turn into a two dimensional piece of artwork, the trees wave up and down at me and swirl inward into each other, the edges of space and time around the limbs themselves seem to fade and all I see is black on the edges of my field of view. With the night rising and the Sun falling. The colors of the trees start to set with the night. Dark... Gloomy... SCARY. I begin to feel a creeping feeling in my spine, like something was watching me. I begin to look in either direction making sure I am alone. The Feeling is Unearthly, my chest seems to be Closing In on itself and the feeling in my arms, legs, and most of my body seem to become cold and drained of this immaculate energy I was feeling prior. I look forward... I look... Inward? Towards the center of the spinning in the trees. BLACK, DARK, EYES. Pierce my heart. Hundreds... Millions of EYES Watching me! There all red and glowing faintly. Just waiting, watching me from THE OTHER SIDE. The Side Where No Light Escapes.. and there are nothing but MONSTERS! This portal in the middle of the trees grow with the swirling effect. The edges creep further and further outward and then out of nowhere... SPIDERS, Giants of the insect world CRAWLING OUT of the portal towards me... I am Absolutely Petrified. I cannot move for my primitive instincts of fear have kicked in. I am Trapped, Surrounded, Helpless... The spiders edge closer and reach for me, they grab at my arms and legs, and climb onto my body. I feel my feet to my head swell with terror as these giants attempt to rip into me piece by piece. I feel an intense Dark Energy fill me with GREATNESS. I feel ABSOLUTELY OVERPOWERED with UTTER DYNAMISM! I think to myself \"Oh the Horror, the Spite, my absolute Demise and finally my Death... How.. HOW INVIGORATING!\" As this horrific event continues to unfold, the Dark Energy teems within me and I feel Unstoppable, like if anything were to touch me, I would overwhelm it with power and it would just explode into clouds of energy. I watch these spiders crawl across me and the elegance of their legs dancing across my body and their fangs, their giant fangs trying to pierce my flesh, I feel like a God from the Underworld and I am in Control.\n\n7:00 pm - With this absolutely impossible feat of energy within me, I leave the outdoors and leave my senses behind. The feeling of God Power leaves me as I push it away, I knew it was just a Fasad. Feeling out of my shoes I roam my basement for some time, liking this newfound energy that I never knew we possessed. We move upstairs to my kitchen were my parents sit and eat. I eagerly great them and ask how their days were. Being out of character (happy, energetic, and poised) I give my parents hugs and tell them I love them and that I would be nothing without them. My parents seem muddled, knowing I have experienced Different drugs before as well as different Manic states, they worry without saying.\n\n7:30 pm - We take ourselves down the stairs to the entry way, I move myself outside into the garage which is open and just park myself on a seat out in the driveway. Thankfully there was a chair in the garage that I could use because at this point, the body load was so high that I could hardly move around my house. Surely Slumped in my chair in the driveway, I look into the stars and just think. I sit and think for hours... \"Why me? Why have I been summoned to live on this earth?\" \"What is wrong with me? How can I fix this?\" I sit out for so long and with my parents on the Radar, my Dad comes out to the driveway for a visit with me. He asked me, \"Hey buddy... are you feeling Alright?\" I responded, \"Dad... I feel the Best I have ever felt in a long time...\". We traded some more choice words and he said he was going to get ready for bed and we said goodnight.. Once he went back inside We sat in that chair completely Bewildered by the Stars. It was the most Fantastic Parade of Shimmering Brilliance, Ballroom Dancing In the Sky. Fantastic Categorical Colors Rush from One Spot to Another. The Stars Destined to Align into Vast Geometric Patterns, Arcs of Lightning Striking the Stars into Smoldering Rubble. \n\n9:30 pm - We finally returned inside my home. I was exhausted from the light show outside, everything is starting to get a little blurry here. My senses felt overwhelmed and needed a break, so I took a trip upstairs and got myself some water. Its common for me to not remember to drink water when I trip, but its extremely refreshing when I get some. I remember I sat on the couch and I looked at the ceiling. This was Especially Nice because I have a Popcorn Ceiling, the ceiling with little bumps on it and the bumps make little shadows. Very nice for tripping. My mind was Perplexed, all these Tiny Dots Roaming Across the Plateau. It Seemed as if Millions of Ants Swarmed My ceiling, Completely blocking the light. This Army Turned to a Shadow, Long, Growing all across the ceiling Covering Everything in Midnight. The Air turned Toxic, Green, a Thick Fog Flowing through the Room. I could Barely Remember where I Was. Something Came over me and I Returned to Earth, I took a Breath and Exhaled Readily.\n\n10:00 pm - We knew the trip was really just beginning. I had a Feeling that something was gonna show up, Usually the Trip comes in Waves and that wave had just passed. It's Really just the Eye of The Storm... You Don't take a Break Once ya Start. I believe we took a trip to my room and we sat for a bit looking at my Tapestry I had put up a while back. It's a Tapestry of the Forest, Moonlight Blue Across the Atmosphere, Stars Ablaze, Snow White. The Blue Swept my Vision and I was Held Captive, My body On Lock, A Brisk Frost Flowed into the Room Like Lava. I completely lost my mind. Giant Trees Bouncing Up and Down in a Three Hundred and Sixty Degree Cone Around me. I could see it all, I truly believe I must have been unconscious with my eyes open. Looking Deep within, I see the lines, the lines within the Blue, These lines are Cell Walls and Membranes, Trading Phosphorous Ions as well as Calcium Ions, I see the walls Collapse and Open Upon Each Other. The Inner Workings of a Cell in motion all seen with my very own eyes. I started to get a little Freaked Out, this was a little Much. I Try to Tear my Vision From The Tapestry... It's like my mind was Nailed to it. Straight through My Skull, Something was Holding Me There. I Look Deeper... An Arm, Green and Hellish, Lapsing into an Inferior Skeleton. I Can't Believe my Eyes, I have to Get Away from This Thing! With about 80% of my Energy, I Rip my Vision from The Tapestry. I was Exasperated I couldn't do it The First Time. An Interesting Experience Indeed.\n\n10:30 pm - Sitting on the side of my bed facing my closet. I look up and see my closet door. It was, rather Strange. The Wooden Doors were Waving at me... the Motion was Intrinsic, Belonging Natural; Essential. I felt as if this Wood was like a Door to the Living. Not as if the Door were Alive, but as If it Came Naturally. The Door Said Hello to Me, not spoken, but in the Form of Mother Nature... The Ether Around Us Smothered Me. I look up and see the Popcorn Ceiling again and laugh. \"What an experience im having...\" is what I said aloud. I sat there for a little, and it came to me. \"What an Real Experience im Having!\" I thought. I Blew a Reassuring \"Whew.\" and to make sure I wasn't Acting Strange, I went to my Mothers Room to say Goodnight. ( At this point, I felt very Calm and Clear Headed. The body Load was Clearing up and I felt I could move easier.)\n\n11:00 pm - \\*Spoiler\\* This Gets Interesting... I Remember the next part much more clearly for some reason.. Maybe because this was a life changing moment.. or because of what went down. I moved towards the down stairs but then all of a sudden. Wow! My cute little dog comes running up to me in the hallway. I speed walk to my puppy (Hes actually 17 at this point) and Greet him. \"Hey Buddy! How are you!?\" I reach down and pet him in his favorite spot, behind his ear and a little down. He sits and wags his tail and I just look at him. My Scientific Brain is Activated by Seeing another Animal Besides Humans. I Break him Down While he Sits. My Brain Scans His Body, Organs, Bones. I see Where all of It Goes. I see his Life expectancy Which is around 10 if you're Lucky, Anything on him that can be Statistical I see it. How many Nails does he have, how long are they, what are its predators, its prey and then It Hit me... I think \"Why do I think all of these things about my Friend When I can just Love him the Way he is? Hes my Best Friend!\"... Then I look up. My Friend. My Pal. My Little Puppy. He sat there and Looked Intently at me. The memory starts to slip into view and I push it away. I say \"I love you.\" And The memory Slips Back into View and He starts To Slip Away... I Now Remember That my Friend had Passed away a couple months ago...\n\n11:30 pm - \\*Still Getting More Interesting\\*... With a Good Feeling on our Inside and a Tear in my Eye, I was Grateful I got to see my Friend again.. I Continue Into the Kitchen from the Hallway and take a Loop around the Bar. A Somewhat large Island in my Kitchen. I head Down Stairs into the Bathroom, I do my Business. Knowing well and clear that I just Peaked and I was only going down from here. That was a good relief. Little Did I Know... Taking More Than I should Have May Cause a Different Experience. Standing in My Bathroom I remember a Term, \"Ego Death\". ---Start of a Rant, Skip for Story.--- It's when you completely Lose sense of yourself and you Instantly forget who you were. I say \"were\" Because I've heard that at this point you have changed your life. For good or for bad, its for you to decide. Your Reality, Friends, Family, You. Are Wiped New and you have the Plasticity for a new self like a Five year old. Eventually The drug will wear off and you will go back to yourself. But that one change, Your Mind Morphed To Forget Everything You Have Ever Known and Start New on The Spot for at least a Good Portion of Your Trip. That'll Change Someone. ---I have Caught Myself Ranting. Back to the Story.--- I think to myself \"Wow... I think I'm having Ego Dea-\". Looking in the Mirror, I see, I see, Nothing. My Brain, all of its processes, Facial Recognition, Eyes, Nose, Mouth. Completely Blurred to Nothing. I Stop trying to see myself so hard and just relaxed my eyes and just Looked.. I see... Wow, I see.. Me? All of a sudden The Wave Rushed Up my back! I was Hit with that Little Sparkle, You know, when you arent really seeing things but everything seems a little more... Real? My Legs were Launched Into Outer Space, My hands Heated to a Quadrillion Degrees! My Torso Filled with this Immense Glow. Its like a Beacon had Ignited Within Me. For some Reason I noticed my Field of Views to Get Severely Morphed. I Felt as if I was Ten Feet Tall and as Wide as a Door ( I'm actually 6'2\" and 215 lb at this time). I could feel it, It was an Internal Shift Coming, I knew it was coming, and It was Straight To The Face. My Brain became Bombarded! Dopamine Like Tidal Waves as High as Everest, Serotonin The Sea Monster Bekens Itself From The Deep Inside of Your Brain Stem Seeping Through The Cells That Holds Em. Epinephrine Like a Spark Plug Erupts My Cerebral Cortex, with the Neurotransmitter of the Fight an Flight System, I am Wide Awake, My Brain on Overdrive. The Chemical Cocktail Brewing Inside My Brain Cells Don't Cease to Amaze me. I am sent to Heaven as if I Died by Thanos, you know when it feels like your whole body Dropped itself into a Million Pieces and you feel each orb Floating in the air as if it were you yourself looking back at you. Your Terror when you instantaneously Dissolve on The Spot And Each Nerve holding You Together is Firing Because In Reality It feels Like you Were Put in a Meat Grinder But feels like Ecstasy... Minutes Later I Fixated my eyes and Realize I've been standing still in the bathroom for about 15 minutes staring at the door and looking behind the curtain of reality. After Teaching myself that I was God and Giving me the Confidence of a Bull, I started to believe that I knew everything about everyone and I knew the truth behind life and why we live. I believed that I was the most special person in my life and have a whole lifetime to give. I realized all we wanted to do to each other is make sure we are comfortable. We just want each other to feel good about themselves.\n\nContinuing Soon...\n\n12:00 pm - Realizing I may be more Fucked than I thought, I rush upstairs towards my room. I get to the door and look inside and the light is on. Just feet behind me is my parents bedroom door and its open. Not knowing what was about to happen, I got this strange feeling to stand still, focus, and close my eyes. Nothing and Everything you wouldn't Believe happened. I saw... well to tell you the truth, there really are no words to describe it. Think of Heaven, Earth, and Hell... The Demons from Hell came Swift with Immense Power, a Dark Sword with a Single Heart in the Middle, its Glowing. Darkness. Gripped by a Hand of Corrupt Cataclysmic Demon Lord, Wielding it to Crush The Gods. Meeting Between Heaven and Hell Upon Earth, An Angel Meets the Demon Lord with a Spear of Radiance. It Cleaves The Demon In Half Releasing Every Mortal Soul The Demon Lord has ever Pilfered. The Gleam Emitted from the Demon was so Devastating it Merced the Entirety of Heaven, Earth, and Hell, and my Eyes, when I closed them. But seriously, it must have been the Definition of Insanity, Nothing but Desolation of my mind, The Image in my Brain was one of the Impossible, I could not comprehend what we saw. Slowly thinking I may go insane if I stay looking at this image. Image is a small word for this feeling. This Feeling had me In A Room Surrounded by these Colors and Swirling Designs of Mosaic Masterpieces, I had that one feeling when you are Flying In a Dream. I Floated there, watching... Thinking \"I'm on the Edge of Insanity... What if I looked over and just saw what there was.\" So I did... There was no time... I was there for an Infinite amount of time like I was never there... When I peaked over, I saw myself sitting in my room... It didn't look like me, but I knew it was me, and it sat and looked at me. It smiled, If I were to try and explain what it looked like, it would be me made out of Play-dough with all different assorts of colors building it. I didn't look at it long before I opened my eyes. I was getting tired of this trip.\n\n12:30 pm - I finally entered my room and laid on my bed... After this there wasn't much that happened. This usually happens for my trips though, They are really intense at the beginning and then they die off. I still feel a little strange but nothing out of the ordinary... At this point, I listened to about two hours of music and then fell asleep.\n\nNext Day ---- I still Feel a Strong Afterglow upon waking. I feel as if my life has been altered forever.\n\nYears Later --- Personally writing this years later, I think this was one of the most important things I have ever done for myself. No matter how irresponsible it was or how much I thought of myself before hand. I cannot be more thankful for what that trip showed me. It taught me to love myself and to love my friends and family. I do not promote the use of any RCs, illegal, or legal Drugs.\n\n&#x200B;", "author": "AdrenalineMedal", "score": 33, "flair": null, "created": 1589288159.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/gi4fjb/2x_heavy_dose_4acodmt_very_dumb_tripreport/", "num_comments": 13, "title": "2X Heavy Dose 4-AcO-DMT (Very Dumb Trip-Report)", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fqco1i7": {"score": 4, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gi4fjb/2x_heavy_dose_4acodmt_very_dumb_tripreport/fqco1i7/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1589292310.0, "body": "this is crazy dude, how did it affect your HPPD?", "replies": {"fqcvzmx": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gi4fjb/2x_heavy_dose_4acodmt_very_dumb_tripreport/fqcvzmx/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1589299619.0, "body": "Honestly, it got rid of it basically completely.

Do you think they were just a hallucination or real entities?", "replies": {}}}}, "dvhsk2": {"text": "**Researcher** \\- Male, 80 kgs\n\n**ROA & Dose** \\- 36 mg oral followed by approx. 200 mg insuffulated over the course of 2.5 days\n\n**Setting** \\- work - at the pub - chilling at home\n\nI prepared 3 capsules into which I poured 12 mg of  the 3-FMA (HCL). As I had work that day I thought it would be wise to dose cautiously. This was new to me and I didn't want to end up chewing my face off in front of my boss.\n\n**T-08:30** \\-  Dosed one 12 mg cap then cycled to work.\n\n**T-11:30** \\- No perceivable effect yet. Had a coffee and a light snack. Dosed 12 mg. Meh.\n\n**T-12:15 -** Feeling *slightly* above baseline - subtly speedy and perhaps a tiny bit empathogenic. Initial body load included a slightly light feeling and wobbly legs but easily manageable and not unpleasant. \n\n**T-12:30** \\- Walked to the pub for a lunchtime with a bit of a spring in my step. Noticed slight increase in appreciation for music. The entourage effect of a pint of ale seemed to compliment the little buzz nicely. I still felt willing and able to return to my office. I feel \"on something\" - but it's easily manageable.\n\nThis reasonably pleasant, yet mild feeling persisted reliably for the rest of the afternoon, although it was accompanied by a slightly fluttery heart which was somewhat disconcerting. Thankfully my appetite was still in tact so I ate the rest of my lunch and had a cup of chamomile tea to try and offset the sketchy heart activity. Obviously that did fuck all, sorry chamomile.\n\n**T-16:30** \\- Dosed last 12 mg capsule hoping that it'd kick in by the time I left the office.\n\n**T-17:15** \\- Left work to meet a friend at a pub. Still feeling similar effects but they appear to be steadily climbing. Possibly due to the nice lift from getting out in the fresh air and away from the work environment. I'm content but beneath the surface I'm still trying to work it out. I decided not to bother taking any more oral doses.\n\n**Summary of oral dose of 36 mg -** As my target dose, this is purportedly in the lower end of the \"strong dose\" range according to Psychonaut Wiki. My experience of this dose orally is that it's a very mild stimulant with a little bit \"extra\" but nothing hugely exciting. However it vibes well with alcohol and I can see its potential as a kind of add on to other drugs such as MDMA to lengthen the experience and add more stimulation. Further experimentation ensued...\n\n..............................................................................................\n\n**T-18:30** \\- After about 4 pints each at numerous pubs en route (total, not per pub!), we arrive back at our neighbourhood and make the executive decision to take some more of this powder. This time we would have a go at snorting it - In this case a total of approx 35 mg (each) up our noses (broken down into smaller bumps). The burn was maybe not the worst I've experienced, but certainly not the smoothest either. After chopping the off-white powder as fine as possible with a clean razor blade, the comfort level of the intranasal ROA was probably comparable to some really shardy ketamine. Keeping lines small and as fine as possible seemed sensible.\n\n**T-19:30** \\- My mate and I went to another pub to ride out the last bump over a couple more beers, by which time we were already moderately inebriated from the booze which seemed to potentiate this effect nicely. Conversation flowed easily with notably more enthusiasm, but not at the expense of completely ear bashing each other and rambling nonsense. After an hour or so, my partner in crime had to go home as he had shit to do the next day.\n\n**T-20:30 -** Unfortunately, I don't possess the capacity for such heroic self control so I proceeded to rail lines in my flat on my own until - well I didn't sleep. I gave up measuring at this point since I had a feel for what it was doing to me so I just had small bumps (approx. 10 mg) maybe every hour or so. I continued bumping it all through the night and the next day... and into the following evening. Crucially, however, this was more out of conscious choice rather than greedy re-dosing; it's much less fiendish than most stims. I genuinely felt as though I could have slept easily, especially with some etizolam at hand.  \n\n..............................................................................................\n\n**Fast forward to the next day...**\n\n**T-10:30** \\- I  haven't slept for two days, have barely eaten and around 80% of my liquid intake has been in the form of beer. Clearly this is not a sustainable way to live, but on the flip side, as far as any come down is concerned  I feel infinitely better than if I'd had the same weekend with Mollie, Whizz or Charlie. \n\n**T-18:00** \\- I met with my girlfriend and shared a few bumps with her.  We probably had around 50 mg each  that evening (though that is pretty much a wild guess). She enjoyed it in much the same way I did.\n\n**T-01:00** \\- Eventually I go to sleep! This much sleep deprivation is not sensible by any stretch of the imagination. I even began having visual hallucinations which was interesting (but that's another story). The 3-FMA enabled me to stay awake all this time but it definitely didn't force me to.\n\nOn waking the next day, I had no real come down to speak of which was a pleasant surprise. I just felt a bit wiped out from the lack of sleep and a mild hangover from the booze.\n\n**TL; DR** \\- Overall this compound was enjoyed by all. I've never tried any other FMAs, FEAs, or anything remotely similar in the RC world but for me, as expected, it was *kinda* like speed (as in regular amphetamine or \"Eurospeed\" - not crystal meth), with a teeny bit of MDMA - nowhere near that same kind of buzz, but the empathogenic qualities increased with further doses. It's also not as fun as proper amphetamine or MDMA but has less of the negative side effects. I found it to be very manageable despite bashing out little lines of it all night/day. It's fairly mild on its own but has a very versatile quality to it. You could either go wild and have a full on weekend session with it or just a few bumps here and there to get through a stressful day. It's as though you have a choice on how you want to be effected by it which is quite contrary to speed or coke. I had better success with the nasal ROA but that's likely due to the dosing.", "author": "Hungryghost02", "score": 12, "flair": null, "created": 1573626957.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/dvhsk2/3fma_hcl_experience_report/", "num_comments": 14, "title": "3-FMA (HCL) Experience Report", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"f7cwy96": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/dvhsk2/3fma_hcl_experience_report/f7cwy96/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1573630755.0, "body": "Sounds lovely.

Of course any rc can be cfs but it seems 3-fpm is one of the most common so just make sure to buy from somewhere reputable and unless they are a government approved chem company then you should buy and use a test kit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3-fpm also anecdotally has pain killing effect on par with weak opioids (not one itself tho) and I've burnt myself pretty bad on it then didn't notice for several seconds (basically a rat hot plate test lmao). Also makes it so you don't notice any of the previously mentioned symptoms not that they are very apparent anyway most of the time, a few times I have gotten quite sick but i've also gone through like a half ounce in the past 4 years so not worth worrying about. I've heard some people get those symptoms more often then others but with healthy usage I don't think most people give a fuck.

As anybody knows both of these can (and usually) takes years if not some of them decades to achieve.\n\nIn *mania life* you feel like you have everything that you need already. Everything. **All that you need is to have certain brillant unique thoughts** that most people don\u00b4t (because they are not taking 3-Meo-PCP hehe) and the energy to put that thought/plan into action (which you also definetely get from the drug).\n\nFrom that point, If you have dosed enough consecutive days to actually believe your shit enough, the disaster has already begun, the question is how much you will get deep in the dirt until you realize those thoughts aren\u00b4t as true as they seem.

I also took a small sublingual booster dose during one of the trials. Physically the powder is pretty caustic, burning a lot when dosed intranasally and leaving a raw spot on mucous membranes when dosed sublingually, similar to 3-MeO-PCP (though without the local anesthesia that 3-MeO-PCP has). Some brief notes on its general properties at those doses were that it was lucid and functional, similar to 3-MeO-PCP or unsubstituted PCP, with a notably greater loss of motor skills. I was able to socialize without issue, and the experiences were both fairly short in duration with a pleasant drawn-out afterglow featuring an elevated mood and increased articulation, especially when combined with etizolam and cannabis in one instance. Overall at those doses, the experience was characterized by a mental stimulation with mild physical sedation, euphoria, disinhibition, light open eye visuals, and a fairly shallow headspace in terms of introspection and meditation. It was delightfully social, though this diminished as I pushed the dose up more. The short duration also lent itself to an urge to redose. The following report is the highest dose I have attempted so far, though I will say that there appear to be diminishing returns as the dose is nudged higher.\u00a0It is also probably worth mentioning the steep dose/response curve, with substantial observable differences with just a 6 mg discrepancy in dose (and this is trusting my scale, so there is some wiggle room there!). Be careful with this one!\n\nT0:00- Powder snorted- it is chalky with an odor of naphtha and burning rubber. There is an instant searing pain. My eyes water, it stings like an acrid petroleum spear up my nose. Thankfully it\u2019s a small quantity of powder but damn is it unpleasant.\n\nT0:05- Rapid onset, feeling a bit faint and dizzy, fingertips numb, it\u2019s a warm and sweaty numbness washing over me reminiscent of nitrite inhalants (poppers). A marked cognitive dissociation has already set in, creeping up on me unannounced. The passage of time suddenly strikes me as an alien and novel concept, its passage tracked through the music I\u2019m listening to. It strikes me as odd that parts of the song will be sensed by me and then disappear forever, even though this is my default state of experiencing anything.\n\nMy head is empty yet very heavy. It is full of warm, wet syrup, smothering my attachments to this world, leaving me feeling distant.\n\nT0:10- I am so dizzy all of a sudden. A powerful spinning dizziness seems to be a remarkable early symptom of ingesting this drug, moreso than any other dissociative I\u2019ve tried. It is a sense of suddenly being very drunk or trying to walk on a violently rocking boat. The drip begins to travel down the back of my throat, acrid and gross and burning most of the way down.\n\nI get up to get some water and my movement is extremely uncoordinated. I have a very hard time standing up straight or walking in a straight line, having to hold onto objects as I walk past. It is interesting to be so heavily incapacitated just 10 minutes into the experience. This doesn\u2019t feel like the loss of coordination and equilibrium that comes with the full-body anesthesia of other dissociatives- rather this just feels like my limbs are not behaving how I want them to. I am still certainly aware of my body and the space it occupies.\n\nT0:15- I still feel warm, relatively, but a sudden chill runs up my spine, through my bones, not like a biting wind on a frigid winter night but like a cold stone that\u2019s been sitting in a dreary rain. I feel queasy, wavy, nauseous, blissful, and a bit itchy and warm at my joints. My breathing feels slower and shallower. I have limited experience with opioids but this is fairly reminiscent of them.\n\nThe experience intensifies by the second, and as time ticks down I feel that initial warmth drain away bit by bit. There is stimulation and mania running through my mind, I am thinking so much about nothing in particular, my thoughts don\u2019t feel especially profound or useful, it\u2019s just a machine running faster than it is supposed to. Physically I feel absolutely still, almost corpselike- as mentioned before, I am not rendered immobile by a full anesthesia. It is certainly not a hole, but a different sort of sedation, there is simply zero desire to move. Everything feels jilted out of place and all I can do is watch. There is a certain joviality and euphoria to it as it continues to build and build and as I continue to sink and sink, it is like riding a speeding boat and catching the cold spray and whipping wind with my face. Exhilarating. I really don\u2019t know what to do with this body, it feels excessive, heavy and unnecessary. So warm yet so cold at the same time. I flick my lighter on and after letting it run for a bit, press the hot metal on my skin, curious about how numb my body is becoming. My reflexive response to the stimulus is certainly reduced. Go figure.\n\nPerhaps the other most noteworthy physical feature is how soft the numbness is-my fingertips feel spongy, or like they are sheathed in undulating clouds, squishing into my body with each keystroke.\n\nT0:20- Though there has been a constant acceleration, there is now a sudden and greater rush, like some great intangible weight smothering my face. The building rush of some dissociatives can sometimes feel like sticking my head in a stream of cold rushing water. This however, is like a lazy outflow from thermal spring, warm and gentle but with an undeniable force behind it. This builds and builds though, from a trickle to a flash flood, gobsmacking me upside the head. I am steady and still and unwavering in the face of its power, it feels like the only thing I can do. The rush of say, 3-MeO-PCP, has a biting edge, a sparkling energy. This has a similar degree of crackling flame behind it, but it is slower, softer, smoother.\n\nThere are pulsing waves of flashing visuals, subtle but apparent, like refreshment bands running the length of an old TV screen. There are spots and blotches in regular hexagonal tessellated patterns slowly and quietly blooming where I can hardly notice them. With my eyes closed I am greeted by nothing but a blue darkness.\n\nThere are clouds streaming out of my skull, towers and pillars, soft and gooey and ever expanding, I feel like I am fading more and more by the second. Such energy courses through my nerves, but it is cold and still , not a manic electrical storm, but a wad of ball lightning.\n\nUltimately I would still say this is quite similar to 3-MeO-PCP- similar in terms of overall lucidity and mental stimulation, but with a heavy streaming dissociation running through my extremities, and less of a pointed rush.\n\nT0:30- I go outside to check a light sheet I have set up- this is a trap used in entomology where a bright light (in this case a UV light) is shone at a white cloth to reflect it at night, attracting large numbers of nocturnal insects. \u00a0I love insects so much. It doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve stepped outside, just into a larger inside. Everything feels so distant, yet at the same time unreasonably flat and close. Exerting myself makes it feel hard to breathe, the sky is heavy and my limbs are heavy, the night is gentle and distant. I trip over my feet just walking a short distance outside. The world is spinning around me and I cannot really figure out how to place my feet. I feel shorter than I really am. I am a bit nauseous. It is hard to focus or examine the insects, which I can normally readily spot ID. They are blurry and indistinct unless I really close one eye and focus on them, and the subtle strobing of my entire field of vision only makes it more disorienting. Some stand out- some large moths, a giant water bug, a great wolf spider stalking the grass. I go back inside after a short while.\n\nT0:35- It is still getting stronger by the second, visuals flash with deeper and deeper contrast, my body feels melty, not entirely melty but melty for something so lucid and functional. Every movement is stuck in syrup, but just a little bit. It\u2019s hard to move, my limbs just feel heavy and I feel no desire to do anything exciting with them. When I close my eyes the visuals are faint and stationary, no specific forms or images stand out beyond broad bands of dull colors. I am developing a double vision that is making it increasingly difficult to read. I find I can read better with one eye closed.\n\nThe experience kicks up in squalls, sudden raging swirling gales, blowing in swells of dissociative fog, blurring and smudging everything they drag their nebulous forms across. I keep drifting off, my eyelids keep sinking shut, my default directive seems to be to just sit here and drool on myself. My mind is awake and active, buzzing away and trying its best to process the disjointed and subdued information it is receiving- my body wants no part of such energy however. I am lazy and sitting in a warm swirling cloud, my head is a big mass of cotton candy spinning from a blue-grey abyss, it is no longer a rush but a constant pressure, building and building by the minute, though it is resolutely comfortable and pleasant.\n\nT0:45- I feel so disoriented, cold metal bars spring from my skull and encase my body before turning to liquid and drifting away with the relentless wind. \u00a0I am wrapped in plastic, I am spinning and sinking. What am I even to do? I have just been sitting still listening to music, it is hard to engage in other tasks. I feel quite nauseous which is uncharacteristic for dissociatives for me. This is static and draining and powerful. My breathing still feels shallow- I would exercise caution with pushing this one towards any higher doses.\n\nT1:00- The experience seems to have capped off- the steady pressure and gentle but definite acceleration have all slowed- the spinning and whipping clouds and dense masses of wind have had the life breathed out of them, they now are carried along only by their momentum. My motor control is still messy, it is still hard to walk properly. I go out and look at my bug light again- all sorts of beetles and an interesting wasp have taken up residence. I smoke a few hits of cannabis while I\u2019m out. The stars glisten in the sky above, great masses of them clustered together into a great sparkling dance, the darkness of space twisting and undulating. It\u2019s a beautifully clear yet humid night. This doesn\u2019t feel particularly manic or energetic- I wish I could just flop down on the grass and gaze into the sky but it\u2019s all wet.\n\nMy brain is jelly, I am probing into depths I shouldn\u2019t be, my brain feels like melted ice cream, when I nod out and close my eyes I am still greeted by the same dull fields and pulses of color. I am reading stuff on the internet but I am not really taking it in, there is no urge or desire to dive into it or read more. The information just bounces off my glassy eyes. My teeth feel heavy and wet and soft.\n\nT1:07- I decide to turn out my lights and listen to music on my bed with a blindfold on. This is usually an exhilarating activity to do while on dissociatives- It can feel like a roller coaster or a vibrant twisting ride into another realm- this however is much more nondescript. I\u2019m still here, on my bed, and I am acutely aware of that the entire time. Instead of a roller coaster I am quietly and gently sailing down a warm viscous river, my field of vision just some quiet color splotches. I try to meditate, to think about memories or dreams, as that often serves as an analytical jumping off point for streams of adventures into the subconscious with other dissociatives. While I would consider this a fairly intense experience, it yields nothing to me in that regard- it crosses its arms and purses its lips and keeps its secrets. Or perhaps it has none to share at all. I would certainly regard this as shallow, an experience grounded more in sensation than in cognition. Lying still on my extra soft mattress pad feels extravagant though. This is a drug for doing things, for enhancing other experiences, for socializing or dancing or just relaxing under some heavy air. It is not the kind of dissociative that is exploratory in its own right, at least not for me.\n\nT1:20- After only trying for a short time to sink into the depths of the experience, I decide to go back to what I was doing before, which was nothing while gazing at a computer screen. My toes and fingers are still very numb and feel like they are made of soft mud. Everything is decelerating and cooling down now, there is a definite comedown. I am still pretty uncoordinated when I try to move, but it is more manageable than before. The peak has certainly passed at this point.\n\nT1:20- Motor skills returning more and more. I can walk in a straight line for the most part, though I will occasionally stumble. Well into the afterburn now. There are flashes of visuals playing in the white of my laptop screen. The double vision is fusing back into one now.\n\nT1:30- Nothing feels quite real, It\u2019s all still cold and weird. The cognitive dissociation lingers. It\u2019s not the sort of empty neutrality that certain substances present though- it\u2019s something brighter, warmer, more pleasant, but ultimately alienating and confusing. So many basic and familiar things seem foreign now, I feel like I have to make a conscious effort to adjust back to the world of sobriety.\n\nT1:40- A glowy dizzy drunky feeling, not sharp or manic, a bit of residual stimulation run through my mind and exits quietly in my muscles as some fidgeting and twitching. I would still broadly characterize this drug as a depressant though, at least physically.\n\nT2:05- I go out to socialize with my roommates, they are watching Seinfeld in the living room. We are all currently under isolation because two of us were exposed to someone who was COVID positive. Talking feels weird and distant, I haven\u2019t attempted to say anything out loud this entire experience so far and now it feels like I\u2019m stumbling on my words as much as I was stumbling on my own feet. I thought I had come down pretty far, that I was inching back towards sobriety, but being around other people made me realize how distant I really was. I am not entirely sure what I am even saying, the words aren\u2019t properly registering in my memory. I am tossing them blindly into the void, hoping they are coherent. My roommates really truly look like I am viewing them on a screen, entirely divorced from their actual presence. This is kind of scary- it makes me feel like I may not realize the full weight of social consequences, that I may not properly regulate or moderate what I am saying. I am truly treading water over some deep depths. I go outside and grab a giant water bug to show them. Talking about an insect I love helps to ground me and feel more in touch, along with coming down more as time passes. After about half an hour I feel like I am socializing normally, better than normal in fact. I take them outside to show them what came to the light sheet and talk about bugs with them, this also helps to ground me. We turn the light off and pack it in, the darkness is heavy and swallowing. They go to bed.\n\nT2:47- I feel mostly down by this point. The experience is only present when I stop and think about it.\n\nT3:11- Still feeling a bit numb and off balance, but otherwise pretty close to baseline. There is a subtle euphoric afterglow that I am not 100% certain I can attribute to the drug but it is definitely there.\n\nT3:30- Mostly just feel tired and sedated and a bit dizzy still. Lying still and doing nothing feels like a sacred activity.\n\nT5:00- Back to baseline.\n\nConclusion: Such an interesting and promising compound that just begs further exploration by intrepid souls! This is, as far as I\u2019ve experienced, one that sees diminishing returns as you increase the dose. The sedation and incapacitation builds as the dose creeps up, eventually glaring out the more pleasant dissociative effects that stand at the forefront at lower doses. At 10-12 mg it feels an immaculate party drug- a euphoric rush with soft edges and a steady pace, reminiscent of unsubstituted PCP or GHB or alcohol. The dissociation of this drug is characterized by dizziness above all else, a sense of spinning and perpetual motion and steady flow. It doesn\u2019t fully anesthetize the body or plunge the user into a hole like other dissociatives, rather it leaves one with a inhibited, off-kilter, but still fully functional and present body, with numbness and distortion rooted in the extremities and skull and seeping inwards from there. Physically, it is sedating, especially at a higher dose, a GABAergic sedation replete with heavy eyelids and slow shallow breathing. There were also odd thermal sensations, an almost feverish being hot and cold at the same time. I do not have much experience with opioids for reference but at the higher dose, sensations similar to how stronger doses of opioids are described were present. This warrants investigation from someone with more familiarity in that area! The headspace is one of stimulation and very slight mania at lower doses. As the dose increases, this is replaced with a dumbfounded neutrality, like just being stunned and unable to properly process thoughts or stimuli. Visual effects are slight, and mostly only with eyes open. With eyes closed, any visuals were barely discernible at any dose. It is not the most introspective and doesn\u2019t seem to lend itself much to therapeutic use. It is however, delightfully hedonistic and euphoric (especially at lower doses) and would be an excellent party drug. What I found it most similar to in fact was alcohol, just being a little past buzzed at 10 mg (or perhaps like I said before, GHB, but a bit stimmier). These returns deplete as the dose increases however, and it quickly turns into a disorienting and less rewarding experience that simply incapacitates the user. The short duration is also noteworthy, though there is a drawn out afterglow, it is subtle and not the typical stimulation that lasts after a dissociative and keeps a user awake in the dark. This does however, lend itself to a desire to redose, which could be problematic with the compounding effects as dosage increases. As mentioned before, this is one for fans of PCP, Alcohol, Poppers, or GHB. This is a fun and worthwhile compound, so long as you aren\u2019t expecting too much depth from it!\u00a0", "author": "Nervewing", "score": 60, "flair": null, "created": 1602756995.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/jbewkp/report_3mepcp_16_mg_intranasal_with_some_notes_on/", "num_comments": 13, "title": "Report: 3-Me-PCP, 16 mg intranasal (with some notes on lower doses)", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"g8vc3cp": {"score": 10, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/jbewkp/report_3mepcp_16_mg_intranasal_with_some_notes_on/g8vc3cp/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1602765392.0, "body": "my man nervewing back with the novel reports! keep up the good work my friend", "replies": {"g8vcqxz": {"score": 9, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/jbewkp/report_3mepcp_16_mg_intranasal_with_some_notes_on/g8vcqxz/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1602765899.0, "body": "Thank you!

Since it's so new, and the powder doesn't look particularly pure (mine is a pale orange-red), I'm hesitant to take a large dose.

I'm in an afterglow right now. I looked up the vaporization point of 3-MEO-PCE a couple weeks and found it was about 400\u00b0 F. Then I looked up the temperature at which glass turns red. Apparently a very faint red is when glass is hitting 400\u00b0 F. So, I tested it and it definitely worked. \n  \nLast night everyone left my place and it was just me and Chris, a good homie. I asked if he wanted to smoke some 3-MEO-PCE and he agreed. So I weighed out our first doses, 15mg, and heated up the dab rig bowl until it was glowing red, giving me enough time to empty out the tray of powder into the bowl by the time it was a faint red.\n  \nIt definitely worked. Effects were felt immediately, and they took about 10 minutes to come up and start a full dissociation experience. Chris wanted to redose though and I already had experience smoking it so I figured why not and we both redosed 15mg. Now this time it was almost like nitrous upon inhalation. My hearing faded in and out and everything was gritty. When I talked my voice sounded distorted like it was slowed down to 0.25x speed on a shitty video player, but still actually at normal  speed when I processed it.\n  \nWe talked and set up a trip area on the floor with a monitor, couch, and floor pads. Proceeded to attempt a hole and smoked 30mg each. I personally didn't hole, but it was really intense. I remember thinking my whole body felt like an icy hot. If I didn't know how to monitor my own heart rate I probably would've thought I was dying, but my heartrate was a cool resting 110bpm, as expected on high doses of dissociatives. Chris said he was holding and couldn't pay attention to the documentary. After about 30 minutes of trying to watch this very interesting documentary I just gave up. I don't think it was a hole though, I just got lost in my thoughts and melted into the couch I was sleeping on. \n  \nEventually I could tell he fell asleep, so I got in a more comfortable position and fell asleep. This was about 2 hours after the initial dose. All in all, great experience, effects didn't seem too watered down through the vaporization ROA.

Not ideal ime but better for me than taking something in between. Medium-low doses are really not helpfull for studying just gets you distracted and you\u2019ll want just a lil more but it\u2019s not enough to get euphoria or a nice rush but the stimulation gets more and more pronounced and in the end you get nothing done, you\u2019re agitated, coming down or can\u2019t sleep and you didn\u2019t even get a decent high or anything. \n\nSo if anyone reads this trying to figure out how much he/she should take before studying after a binge, absolutely with street speed of unknown quality, less is definetly more in this situation.
