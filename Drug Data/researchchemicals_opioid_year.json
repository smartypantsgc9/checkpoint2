What's the difference between 5apb 5mapb and 6apb 6mapb 6eapb", "replies": {"g4lp1lp": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ip4js0/most_enjoyable_rcs_in_your_opinion/g4lp1lp/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1599725064.0, "body": "I've never done 5-APB, 6-MAPB or 6-EAPB. \n\n6-APB is reminiscent of MDA in the it feels psychologically deeper and is more visual and psychedelic. I have taken really high doses of it and always found it to be less social and more introspective. I've taken it with friends at home, alone at shows and with groups at a festival. Every time, I rolled hard but never felt much like talking or dancing. It would last 8-10 hours and was always really hard to sleep after. I personally think MDA is superior because it has similar visuals but the headspace for me is definitely more social, and the shorter duration is much more ideal since both 6-APB and MDA can feel heavier and more taxing for me than MDMA/5-MAPB.\n\n5-MAPB is very close to MDMA. It has a longer duration and a longer come up. Lasts 6-8 hours. The roll is harder by weight, and the overall experience is more consistent. You take a while to peak, then gently come down over the course of a couple hours, whereas MDMA can hit you in the face 30 minutes in, have you rolling tits for 2 hours then start dropping off out of nowhere, hitting a waves for a bit after that. 5-MAPB is less in-your-face energetic, but imo it is more pleasurable than MDMA. Holy freaking shit it's great, and prefer it to MDMA. If you want the extra push you can just add caffeine to it. 5-MAPB doesn't have much of a comedown and the hangover isn't as bad as MDMA ime. I've taken it a couple days in a row and it worked just fine both times. You can also dose lower and still get positive effects. I've taken 30-50mg and still found myself feel much more social and energetic, where if I take less than 60mg of MDMA, I might feel a bit of stimulation and serotonin push, but the urge to socialize or dance isn't there and taking a lower dose feels wasteful. 5-MAPB lasts longer, doses lower, has more consistent effects, is more versatile in it's dose-range, and is less pushy than MDMA. I also don't have trouble getting to sleep after a roll on 5-MAPB, which I greatly appreciate in comparison to 6-APB. \n\naMT is incredible but also pretty finicky. It can last 12-16 hours orally. Some people get a strong experience off of 30mg and some don't feel anything. Some people run into trouble with doses above 80mg and some people are fine. You wanna dip your toes in slow and find what works for you. I used to take 10-30mg before going into work at a retail store. It would dilate my pupils but other than that I just felt a bit more social and energetic and had light visuals. aMT is pretty much the best parts of mushrooms and MDMA. The visuals are like a light dose of shrooms or 4-AcO-DMT, mixed with the light, technicolor rainbow you get on MDMA. The energy is very much like MDMA, I'd say more like MDMA than 5-MAPB because once you find the dose that gets you rolling, it can feel pretty pushy, but I mean that in a good way since the mushroom aspect kind of balances it out. aMT has a 2 hour comeup orally, and this is usually accompanied by extreme stomach discomfort and sometimes nausea and vomiting. I have never puked on it, but I found myself laying down in the fetal position for an hour or so shivering because of the fluctuations in my sensitivity to temperature on more than one occasion. The visuals are beautiful and not overpowering at all. It's a perfect balance of a serotonergic roll mixed with a mild shroom trip. To bypass the nausea and shorten the duration, I highly recommend dosing rectally. I could use 35-60mg rectally and would usually be rolling pretty well within 20-30 minutes. Rectal administration also shortens the duration to about 8 hours and really cuts the bodyload down. It's very ideal for a rave or festival with this ROA and I find it easier to fall asleep and recover compared to dosing orally. \n\nI don't recommend insufflating 6-APB, 5-MAPB, or aMT. They all taste horrible, burn quite a bit and don't seem to work as well as other ROAs. All of them are more uncomfortable to snort than MDMA.\n\nApologies for the long response, but I hope this helps!", "replies": {"g4mhe6q": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ip4js0/most_enjoyable_rcs_in_your_opinion/g4mhe6q/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1599741341.0, "body": "The one thing i found to be most negative is the short duration of mdma.

I may be lucky to have woken up, but I also might have damaged my hearing long-term.\nI woke up from being either passed out or blacked out, and I thought I had woken up in a war zone.  The room was spinning and shaking, I was in tremendous pain, disoriented, unable to walk, and my ears rung louder than any noise I'd ever heard.  I literally expected to see splintered wood and a collapsed ceiling because it felt like a grenade or flashbang had gone off.  It sounded like I was deep underwater, I was so deaf I couldn't her my own voice. I could only hear sharp noises, which were severely distorted. I knocked on wood, and it sounded like a chainsaw snapping into glass. And the sound was extremely painful and loud.\nI thought I was dying, and sure that I'd lost my hearing forever.  I tried to get someone to take me to the hospital but I was too disoriented and I passed back out. \nThe next day I woke up in a lot of pain, and my hearing was better, but very damaged. It's been 3 or 4 days now, and my right ear seems pretty much normal, but my left ear still feels like it's underwater. I have a hard time understanding people. My balance is quite off- I always feel like the world is tilted by about 15-20 degrees sideways, and like my body is twisted, as if my torso is at a different angle than my legs, even when I stand straight. I am worried that I did permanent damage to my cochlea, and may not have proper hearing and balance again unless I have surgery. \n\nSo, please be careful with this substance, especially if you have hearing problems or have experienced ototoxicity with any other substances.\n\n**Update: sorry everyone, I quit reddit a few weeks ago because I felt it was a bad influence and consumed too much of my time.  My balance is back to normal, and I think I will recover completely/mostly. I still have a ringing in my left ear, and occasional problems understanding people (although I've always had that problem).  I hope that in another week or so my left ear will have recovered. A scary experience nonetheless!\n\n***Update after reading comments: I have very low blood pressure, so I dont believe that is the culprit, although I was IVing it, so that may have caused a blood clot?  My veins are pretty hard still, and were irritated after I discontinued use.  Thank you to those who commented about their opioid overdoses causing the same issue.  I'm inexperienced with opioids, and believe it likely that I did overdose.  The studies I've been reading report that MOST opiates are ototoxic, and the effects can be permanent with long term, non-overdose use, and more often temporary after an overdose.  I dont have any studies on this chem specifically, but I'd be willing to bet that, like most opiates, it is ototoxic, but that with responsible, short term use, hearing defects are unlikely to occur (which, again, can be said of any opiate).

Research chemicals are still obscure, their properties and effects, especially long term ones, are studied to a small degree or not studied at all. Most of the time people don't even know and dont bother to think about what is in their batch of bath salts or \"spice\" or what's layed on the blotter of \"acid\". \n\nBy the way it looks like such carelessness and lack of knowledge is more dangerous relating to RC's in comparison with classical drugs. Real acid don't kill people, unlike new RC analogs and derivatives. Real weed is safe, but RC cannabinoids are not. Shit, even old and known opiates are somewhat safer than new RC opioids especially ones that are fentanyl derived. And plain good ol amph is safer than lots of new RC stims. \n\nWhy RC's became so widespread and popular if they are worse than classic compounds in terms of safety? And RCs are not only deadlier, but in a number of cases they produce worse \"high\" than old drugs.\n\nI have experience with a lot of drugs both regular and newly designed. DOB is worse than LSD (in terms of \"high\" and overall experience, and I tried it more than once or twice), A-PVP or MDPV are worse than old meth (smaller duration, more cravings and compulsivity, far shittier comedowns and narrower therapeutic intervals which means frequent overdoses). Synthetic cannabinoids produce stupid and most of the times not very pleasant condition, feels somehow resembling weed but with a plastic unnatural feeling, retarded jaw-hurting and unpleasant spontaneous laughing sessions sometimes for an half-hour in a row (not a case with the weed) and high potential for dependency and daily binges (unlike weed again). \n\nSo what can we conclude from aforementioned? RC's are overall worse than their well known respected \"founding fathers\". Yes, that's my personal opinion and it's a not always a case, but I mentioned some points to prove myself right. Btw I'd be glad to discuss on this topic if you disagree with my opinion. \n\nWhy RC's became popular then? In my opinion it is caused by the \"war of drugs\" around the globe which has gained momentum in the past few decades. RC's became widely used as an attempt to find a workaround. It was a loophole in drug prohibition laws. Who in his right mind would fuck around with some unknown chinese RC if there are familiar and reliable drugs? No one! (Well, there always were people interested in such stuff but it was a small minority.) And no one bothered indeed, until laws and governmental pressure made dealing with classical drugs too much of a problem for pushers and their clients. \n\nIs \"war on drugs\" effective then? No, they banned old drugs, people started to use new drugs. They banned new drugs, people synthesized a bunch of newer ones. You forbid deals with whatever compound - people will synthesize some derivative totally unknown before. In this chase narcs are always a step behind, they can't forbid every possible psychoactive substance in advance. \n\nGovernments around the world have tried to eradicate drug abuse by repressive methods for decades or maybe hundreds of years. Lets look on ethanol which is a psychoactive drug of abuse as well as every other substance of the sort. For some reason dumbasses still tend to draw an imaginary line between booze and other drugs, i.e. that's fine to have a beer or two in the evening but that's unacceptable to even say aloud something like \"I had some coke yesterday, shit was good\". What an example of Orwellian doublethink. This bullshit mindset someday will cease to exist, I believe.\n\nProhibition laws on alcohol both in USA and USSR has failed to cease alcohol consumption. People drank before, people drink nowadays and they will continue to drink booze in the future. These prohibition attempts only removed legal production from the market, along with huge chunk of tax income and QC (so people drank alcohol made not for human consumption like ethanol-based face lotions, liquids for cleaning windows etc). People didn't gave two shits about that laws and continued to drink, either brewing at home or buying from bootleggers. Even USSR with its notorious repressive state policies and ubiquitous propaganda failed in that 'war on booze'.\n\nSo why governments are still trying to use those ineffective flawed bullshit methods that failed to solve the problem before? With donkey's stubbornness they continue pointless 'war on drugs', even when more progressive countries like Belgium or Czech Rep. show that legalization of drug usage and creating a legal, white, tax-paying and controlled market have much better results both on public health and state budget.\n\nEither governments are composed of utter idiots, total retards that can't put a cube in a square hole and stop this idiotic \"war\". Or our rulers are not stupid and they understand that their actions are fruitless, and the only outcome is that number of people in jails is rising while drug usage remains the same?\n\nI guess it is impossible that everyone who occupies the high seat is retarded. There's simply not enough retards to fill all parliaments around the world. And these guys, presidents and ministers, really don't look like they all have IQ of a potato.\n\nSo they know that their actions will never achieve declared goal. And they are not stupid. And they have live examples of countries that decided to stop putting their citizens behind bars for drugs. These countries are doing good, levels of drug abuse or crime rates became lower after such reforms. In Belgium one can bring his shit to a public lab to be tested. In most countries one can't even publicly mention that he uses drugs, he'll have problems with cops, with his employer at work, his landlord and neighbours.\n\nWhy? I'm not into conspiracy, but this situation looks like some kind of... genocide? You pursue your people, you put them behind bars for years, ruining their lives, you brainwash nation (\"meth not even once\" campaign, yup, but not \"cigarette not even once\") instead of real harm reduction and education. And you do this while knowing that this actions are pointless, so it can't be justified as \"temporary violence for the greater good of people\".\n\nTLDR: don't waste your time reading, im on meth so i spent two hours writing this wall of text not in my native language, i only wanted to reply to someone's comment, but it went too far as you see. I'll just return to my boring stimfap. Boring and not really pleasant cause I should keep silence to not awake my parents in other room.

As I mentioned before, this language is not my first so I guess I show more eloquence in the native language which Western people, sadly, don't understand. English is simple, lapidary I'd say, and slightly primitive (or rough?). Some thoughts are easier to express in English due to that properties. But my mother's tongue is much more profound, you can use a bunch of different words to describe something, and when general meaning leaves unchanged there are different tones to these variations, y'know? Also I think that our flexible grammar and free sentence structure adds another layer of expression. And of course our truly modular obscene vocabulary, it's possibilities are almost endless. Unlike English, sadly. Your language is good for some technical articles or for a boring free newspaper with local news and a tv program on the last page.\n\nAlso my eloquence may be linked with the fact that I'm in the 98.6 percentile as that free online IQ test stated. Ok ok I don't jerk off in front of a mirror, lol. Actually, once I ate a shitload of A-PVP and went nuts, that time I saw myself naked in a tall mirror and started to fap like a maniac looking at my Jr. Quite disturbing and slightly shameful isn't it? But man bath salts really transform you into an animal. Once I poured my stash into the toilet but didn't flush it. Few minutes after I regretted and ran back, almost all shit went straight into water and dissolved, but there was small amount untouched right where the water level is in the hole of toilet. I collected these remains with my index finger and gummed. It worked lol.

I said that but only about blacks. And I meant African people of the negroid race. It is true that these people lived in a primitive tribal way in the time I talked about. Actually they had similar very primitive lifestyle and rudimental social structure even in a relatively modern era.\n\nHave you thought about how white colonists were able to capture black slaves in such big numbers, regularly, for decades? I'll tell you, primitive social structure of natives wasn't allow consolidation of tribes into something bigger. Whites exploited this \"fragmentation\" and also ignorance and naivety of the black people. On frequent occasions colonists simply did a bargain with a \"princeling\" or a chief of local tribe. Tribal rulers have sold their people to whites. Any structurized and systemic resistance was impossible due to absence of statehood or any consolidating institutions. Whites frequently used local conflicts between neighboring tribes to own benefits. \n\nAnd you can witness echo of that times even now. Black countries are mostly poor, undeveloped, and in the state of permanent civil war. That fragmented structure with a shitload of different tribes (nations) can be seen even today in Africa, remember secession of the South Sudan, that conflict had roots not only in religious differences. \n\nMajority of developed African black countries started to grow only after white colonization. When white colonists were sent out after a revolution these countries immediately slowed down temps of economical growth and went back to shit. Zimbabwe is a perfect example and proof of my words (also it's a rare case of black country that had at least kind of statehood, decent military power and beyond-national institutions, thanks to the king Shaka). When Zimbabwe was under brits and was called Rhodesia, quality of life, economic indexes and temps of growth were decent, Rhodesia was among the fastest growing countries in the region. Then black people decided that they no longer need bad white invaders, it's time for the independence and shit. After only 20 years without whites Zimbabwe dug itself into shit beyond any limits. Now this country exists only to be the source of memes and jokes, Zimbabwe is generally synonymous to \"fucking shithole\" now.\n\nYou see, bro, can you understand what I'm about now? Negroid people (it's not offensive, just a scientific term) even today live in crap, and reason for this is same as to black slavery. And I don't say that all niggers are stupid ass-naked ooga booga baboons, God forbid. When black people are incorporated into a developed progressive society they can perform great, like N. Degrass Tyson (if i spelled the name right). So no hard feelings, just in case, no offense was meant by me.\n\nSumming it up: people of the African negroid race lived in trees (metaphorically), not \"other races\". And aforementioned people continued to live in trees to the most recent times. And today they are still mostly living in trees (metaphorically again), but now we call it \"slums\" or \"ghettos\", and instead of real trees they started to use chipped bricks, rusty metal sheets, and other garbage.", "replies": {}}}}}}}}, "g5hfj28": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/itk2xf/rise_of_rcs_and_drugs_prohibition/g5hfj28/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1600301935.0, "body": "What you're saying makes a lot of sense.

Lived in a woodsier town but had a close friend of mine move to a bordering city into his first apartment. Shortly thereafter he discovered the wide world of chemicals and due to living in the projects realized he could do what he wanted without scrutiny (New England really only gives a shit about opioids). Before you know it, my boy was a walking RC shop and had literally ANYTHING you could think of. \n\nI walked around with a chip on my shoulder because I was more experienced in the world of chemicals than my counterparts so I felt as if nothing was a match for me. Boy was I wrong. After trying most psychedelic analogues I felt like I was ready for an \u201cexperience\u201d. After I told my friend about this he hands me two gel capsules and says \u201ctake one for an EXPERIENCE\u201d and explains they each contain 20mg of (purity tested) almost RAW 2C-E (not the cut Dutch vendor crap). I take what he says seriously and I head home.\n\nYoung ignorant me doesn\u2019t do any research on the compound and decided to do it. Didn\u2019t look up how dose sensitive it is, didn\u2019t look up side effects, nothing (dumb I know). I tell my girlfriend at the time what I was about to do and if I was acting weird that was why. So I ingest the first capsule around say 7 PM, have a beer, and wait. About an hours goes by and absolutely nothing, hour and half STILL nothing. At this point I get pissed and think my friend has ripped me off and I try to call him and his phone is off (let his phone die all the time, big MXE head). At the two hour mark I had had enough and ate the other cap for whatever reason. Only 15 min later and fucking WHAM the first one hits me, so the ride begins.\n\nThe initial feeling was not a nice come up, it\u2019s was almost immediate and surprising. To be fair I didn\u2019t mind the first capsule as the visuals were very fun and exciting but the body load was indescribable. It was as if someone was standing on my chest at all times. I enjoy this very LSD esq trip for about an hour or so, until the turning point arrives. Due to this already being intense, my girlfriend coming up and saying \u201cdid you take the other cap?\u201d made me go into a frenzy. I had completely forgotten I\u2019d taken the other one, I was so consumed by the initial 20 mg I totally blanked out. My heart began to race, it felt like time stood still, I knew I was in for it.\n\n4  1/2 hour mark was hands down where things went completely downhill. I DISTINCTLY remember the point where reality was no more. I walked into my girlfriends room and she had American Dad on her Tv, the solid colors from the TV beamed out and passed my head so when I looked around me I was surrounded by these solid colors I had seen. Before I go further let me add for those who didn\u2019t see my other post that out of the hundreds of times I tripped I NEVER saw shit that wasn\u2019t there in reality. So I sit on her couch and try to take deep breathes. At this point the body load is so completely out of control it feels like there is pressure inside my body trying to push out, it felt as if my arms and legs were going to explode off of my body, the only thing that helped was flexing my muscles as hard as I could to counteract it.\n\n6 hours in and I\u2019ve peaked at this point from the two pills. I\u2019m still sitting on the couch, I look up at her textured ceiling and all of a sudden a giant void opens up from the ceiling and shapes begin to fall out. Triangles and vine looking structure was what it was mostly made up of but I couldn\u2019t fucking believe what I was seeing. I was actually in disbelief since I was a naysayer of \u201cfictitious\u201d trips before this. After staring at the ceiling and the walls for an hour or two in sheer horror I spent the next hour crying in my girlfriends lap because I wanted it to go away. \n\n8 hours mark everyone is asleep, it\u2019s early in the AM, I am alone and the trip has not subsided at all. Although at this part of it I wasn\u2019t having as intense visual hallucinations and actually what was happening was when I closed my eyes, anything I pictured in my head, would seem like I was actually there in a dream. It was fucked. I liked rap music a lot at the time and watched a lot of videos and I remember shutting my eyes at one point and I could see the video PLAIN as day and it was as if I was dreaming I was there. \n\n14 hour mark and the trip is wearing off, the last two hours I spent hugging my golden retriever real tight because it actually helped with way I was feeling for whatever reason. Sunrise, boy do I fucking hate watching the sun come up, adds to the anxiety even more. My entire body is stiff as a fucking board from being locked up for 14 hours. Tracers were insane the next day on this compound and lasted almost entire next day. I\u2019d like leave off in the note that you should always research before trying things. Also, when people like Shulgin name a compound \u201cthe teacher\u201d......... tread lightly.

That is just plain wrong according to several nembers and I apologize for being so blithe. Please do your own research uf you're looking for a dose equivalent amount of C-LAM to your benzo of choice. \n\nComing up on my 2nd year of an addiction that cost me my beautiful family, a nicely equipped workshop with pretty much every tool imaginable for building motorcycles (Italian bikes, my hobby), landscaping my property, and basic repair work on my families vehicles. Not to mention the $20,000 in my savings account (crazy how fast an addict blows through his or her cash) \n\nTL;DR: I lost everything, including some actual clothes on my back!\n\n*I want to quit. I'm so fucking over this lifestyle*. But it seems most people don't think im *actually* serious about quitting because I can't and won't do it without self medicating. Maybe I'm a coward... The first thing that I feel as the wd begins to take hold is dread. I'm terrified of 6 hours of dope sickness let alone 3 days. As most opioid addicts know, the mental and physical symptoms can only be called hell. Despite the \"experts\" and their; \"oh, its like having the flu\". Nope. It's not. It's a torture rack. Evsry cell in your body is off. Basic bodily functions like your respiratory and digestive systems are haywire. Your actual bone marrow hurts. Your mouth is sticky and dry, eyes and nose running like a sieve. Red hot pokers stabbing your guts, doubling you over, getting out of bed to retch and dry heave every ten minutes isn't an option so you puke in a bucket next to your bed. You may even literally shit the bed. You're in so much physical and emotional pain all you can do is thrash around in bed, gushing with sweat, obsessing over how awful you feel. \n\nTL;DR: Withdrawal is absolute hell.\n\nIf you've gotten this far, thank you for reading. Now plz listen to my plan... Critique it, add to it, ask questions, just please be helpful.\n\nI've decided to order copius amounts of clonozolam and a mild opiate such as kratom to take the edge off.. The \"kick a little at a time\" approach. I do believe I have what it takes to use the kratom responsibly and only if I absolutely can not sleep without it. The clonozolam is the key here tho - I wanna be so zonked out on benzo sedatives that my RLS, mental terrors, all the actual fear is gone. I plan to load up on the kratom plus high doses of C-LAM, and by day number 3 continue the fight with just C-LAM, seroquel, and clonidine. Get myself to the point where I can transition to the pure buprenorphine pills I have stashed away.\n\nSo before I go shopping for RC's... I have about $500 I can spend. Looks like I can get a TON of most rc benzos dirt cheap... $350 for 500 mg of clonozolam, and from whst I read the clonozolam - clonozepam dose conversion is almost equal mg for mg. Are there other benzos I should be considering, maybe something closer to alprazolam that hits harder and faster? \n\nI already know what many of you are thinking - I'm going to trade a massive fent addiction for a deadly benzo addiction. And that will be true... at first. I've kicked enormous kpin and xanax habits before by tapering, and tapering off benzo is nbd to me bc I don't particularly care for them (benzos). They have zero recreational value to me. My last bout was scoring a womens stash of 1mg kpins she was selling - a years stash - 400 1mg blues. Developed a 12-15 mg/day habit. When I noticed my bag was getting low I quickly tapered my 10-15mg habit down to 5-10 within a month, then found a psych who gave me 3mg a day. I was fine. These rc benzos will be strictly for making my wd suck less, but I have no illusions that I'll instantly be fine on 2mg afterwards (assuming I conquer my fent habit). So please, just give me the benefit of the doubt that I'll be able to keep my benzo use under control.\n\nWell then... I have C-LAM as my benzo of choice, kratom as my parachute... Anything else I should add to this cocktail?\n\nPretty sad that I'm doing this much planning and drug shopping to get through what's essentially about 40 hours, long enough to get back on subs. What can I say, I'm a wuss.\n\nSuggestions for alternative benzos and other RC's that may stimulate the opioid receptors would be great. If only *I can just fucking get a little sleep* I think I can conquer this. Being wide fucking awake for 3 agonizing days and knowing $20 worth of dope will end the misery is not an easy thing to do.\n\nThank you all for reading this and for your input. I know this is a bit of a rambling post. With the wide world of RC's we now have at our disposal, there's never been a better time to self medicate...

Alprazolam/xanax helped me a great deal with the anxiety during my withdrawal. The only problem I found using a benzo to take the edge off is that it only does just that--you still are going ton suffer the withdrawal but the benzo can help you be in a better place mentally for it which can make all the difference in the world. Where i went wrong on some occassions is trying to take outrageous ampunts of benzos to completely kill the bad feelings--that just typically led to me getting so fucked up on benzos that id end up making stupid decisions and relapsing. And even on extremely high doses of benzos during opiate withsrawal, i still felt the pain, so taking the excessive amounts didnt really help at all.\n\nSo, the point I am trying to make is that you want to understand its best to only take a normal daily dose to relieve your anxiety from the withdrawal and not try to make yourself completely numb with it.\n\nKeep in mind, you will want to quit taking them as soon as possible too--benzo withdrawal in my opinion is much more severe than opiate withdrawal and lasts much longer. I wouldnt dose for more than 3-4 days max, and even that can feel uncomfortable to come off of. \n\nCant really speak to the efficacy of kratom here.

Clonidine works wonders for chills and hot flashes, gabapentin for muscle aches and spasms and RLS. And hydroxyzine for itchiness/restlessness. Propranolol is also good for the physical symptoms of anxiety.

The following is somewhat based off my education but mostly based off of my personal experience as an addict. \n\nHave you ever detoxed at an actual medical detox facility? Because these are all just drugs they would give you there. Except not propranolol. \n\nThey typically prescribe you gabapentin, clonidine, hydroxyzine, and a little bit of valium in my experience. \n\nI would use all of those, and then add some\nOtc meds. Such as cbd/thc, multivitamin, kava, ashwaghanda, phenibut. If you want a longer but less intense kick, you can try doing a suboxone taper, but assuming you don\u2019t have easy access to that, Kratom is an absolute godsend. I would never kick without kratom on hand. Some people have had success with Imodium, but I personally wouldn\u2019t use it with the purpose of alleviating withdrawals, it\u2019s also dangerous in high dosages and can induce extremely bad cardiovascular damage when taking high dosages for long periods of time. I do recommend using it for its intended purpose, as an anti-diarrheal at normal doses.   \n\nAssuming you are in the USA, the only meds I\u2019ve listed that would raise a doctor\u2019s eyebrows are Valium and suboxone. A psychiatrist who knows your situation would likely be willing to write you a tiny script for say Valium 5 mg x 8 for a quick 4-6 day detox. If he doesn\u2019t want to, no big deal. That\u2019s why I listed so many alternatives. Getting into a suboxone program with a licensed physician is somewhat hard and expensive to do, and most psychiatrists aren\u2019t even allowed to give subscripts. You can find a licensed one near you on suboxone.com. \n\nThe quickest, easiest, and least expensive method would be to ask your doctor or psychiatrist to write you the scripts for those 4 detox drugs up above. Or just the first 3 and substitute propranolol for Valium if the doc is uncomfortable with benzos. and be upfront that they are for detoxing off of opioids. I\u2019ve never had a doctor argue or say anything. Then on your own, get the otc meds, supplements, vitamins, and Kratom. Only go the suboxone route if you can\u2019t stay clean and you need a maintenance drug because nothing else works.

I'm not even aware of the existence of such an opioid. The only substance I know that has both MOR and D2 activity is Ketamine - but MOR affinity is very weak (700\u03bcM), and D2 affinity is high (0.05\u03bcM), so the opioid receptor activity is so insignificant it can be discounted entirely, as it may not even meet the threshold for measurable physiological effects.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm an idiot and don't have any pharmacology or chemistry knowledge to help you.

Love you all. Wanted to make a follow up post to my last one on the relatively unresearched synthetic opiate, AP-238\n        \nI had one intranasal session a night starting 2 weeks ago, skipping maybe 2-3 nights. I would do 10-20mg lines at a time, never exceeding 50/60mg per session. The drug itself was very chill, provided a nod that is personally preferable over fentanyl or heroin for me (no opiate addiction history or tolerance ever, just experimentation) The past 3 nights I have stopped using daily and would like to update on my nasal side effects. \n  \nTo begin, my nose would be constantly clogged and full of mucus boogers throughout the day after. Every morning I would blow my nose several times in the shower, producing disgusting looking partially solid mucus with opaque white or yellow color. On the first day of abstinence I decided to do some 2-FDCK again for the first time in several months. It was awesome, and I even unintentionally holed harder than I ever have before! It was great, but I think it made my nose even worse. Since then, whenever I blew my nose one nostril would have blood in the snot but not be continuously bleeding. \n  \nNow, after trying to blow my nose at work and clean up the mucus, it just started bleeding. And whenever I try to blow it gently or sniff too hard it starts bleeding again! Absolutely nuts side effects for not that much general substance going up the nose.

Some of you might remember him. Regrettably I haven't seen him since he went to a very dark place from binging on a-PVP. \n\n---\n\nIt depends what kind of \"euphoria\".\n\n* Full Release Euphoria: 5-MeO-DMT\n* * Dopa Rush Euphoria: A-PVP\n* Just dopa euphoria by itself: MDPV (has way less NE action than A-PVP)\n* * Serotonergic and dopa Euphoria: MDMA, 4-MMC, or Methylone\n* Serotonergic Euphoria: e.g. MDAI\n* * Opioid euphoria: e.g. H\n* etc...\nIf you wanna a description of the different euphorias:\n\n* Full Release Euphoria: Basically impossible to describe. You are all, and all is you. There's only it, which is all. There's no more form, no duality, no time, just pure existence, pure consciousness, pure love/bliss.\n* Dopa Rush Euphoria: Just an intense rush, pure orgasmic, puts the biggest smile on your face, you ever had, makes you incredibly horny. You feel like the king of the world, invincible.\n* Dopa Euphoria plain, the same, but without the orgasmic rush.\n* Serotonergic Euphoria, paired with dopa. You feel like you wanna hug the whole world, You just love everybody and everything, you really like going around and meet people and hug them etc. You're very open and can share your secrets without fear (many people don't like this, as afterwards they are embarrassed).\n* Just sero euphoria. You also are in this love, but totally calm, no desire at all to get up and e.g. walk around. Many people don't like this.\n* Benzo Euphoria: This you actually only get, if you have an anxiety issue, as it takes away your anxiety, and this relief is experienced as euphoria.\n\nBut be warned that some of these substances have an extremely high addiction potential. E.g. be aware that crack is like a child's toy in comparison to A-PVP.\n\nFor me personally, I long the most for dopa rush euphoria and full release euphoria. But every now and then some MDMA euphoria is also good. But the latter should anyways only be done seldomly.

With this Kappa Opioid, you are actually PRESENT and \"clear\" in your mind during the trip. \n\nIt starts 4-5 minutes after smoked. You can barely see the physical reality, and it's like you experience in parallel/multitasking something like 10'000 realities. There is a curious effect (this compound was tried from 3 people) in this: it's causing a wormhole timeloop. Like you progress by experiencing those 10k realities, trying to figure out which one is the correct one, and then it happens like a \"reset\", you back in time and the loop restart, but with less realities because you \"excluded\" the ones you realized they were not real. And every time you start the loop, more details add to those realities - allowing you to understand and discard more of them. Some takes places in a totally different physical reality in front of your eyes, some other are exactly the physical reality you see but then they crumbles like a glass breaking into pieces and you discard then this one.\n\nThe Loops I counted were approx 100-120, and I had the impression it took 4 hours to find out the exit door. Luckily my GF was at home, and she was the one who experienced this thing, because he tried the same product but sold as e-liquid. So she helped me finding out the right reality. I mean, it was not a bad trip, even if I was really scared at the moment because totally unexpected.

Also they are full agonists instead of partial agonists, this allows for overdose to occur at high doses unlike just thc.

But it should be noted that some effects are due to the (+) stereo-isomer and some to the (-). If you are curious, there are quite a few studies that go into depth about findings for each. But for the purpose of this sub, it doesn't make sense to me to talk about them separately since most compounds on the gray market are essentially not going to be enantiomerically pure. Anyways, lets get to the pharmacology:\n\nHA-966 is an NMDA antagonist at the glycine receptor site (not MK-801 site). Rats conditioned to discriminate between effects similar to PCP did not identify this compound as such. What it *does* do, however, it act as a potent anxiolytic and sedative. In a manner that was more or less consistent with GHB. But surprisingly, most studies have failed to show any appreciable affinity for the GABA-B receptor. For those of you who don't know, the GHB receptor is not sedating. Endogenous GHB actually does the opposite, it causes the release of the excitatory NT glutamate (if GABA is the yin, then glutamate is it's yang). The reason GHB-derivatives are sedatives is because they produce much higher concentrations of GHB than occurs normally, and they start binding to GABA-B. This means that HA-966 may retain many of the pro's of GABA-ergic anxiolytics/sedatives, while being devoid of some of the noteworthy cons (i.e. benzos and thienos are trash, strongly suggest not using them).\n\nOther than anxiolytic and sedative effects, it is effective at reducing pain (as well as the dose of opioids required for analgesia and tolerance to them in general, according to mouse models) and is neuroprotective.\n\nIronally, structurally i bears a striking resemblance to GBL. Except it is lactam and not a lactone, with a hydroxyl substitution on the N. Which makes it even more curious that it does *not* appear to be GABA-ergic, but operates via a \\[novel?\\] sedative mechanism.\n\nTLDR; HA-966 is an NMDA-antagonist at the glycine site. Not a dissociative, but has sedative activity similar to GHB despite not appearing to be GABA-ergic at all.\n\nI have seen it available so if anyone has taken it to self-treat sleep or anxiety (which I don't recommend, see a doctor) - speak up!", "author": "RvnclawPotionsMaster", "score": 92, "flair": null, "created": 1579356196.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/eqcqjb/ha966_an_atypical_sedative_anybody_have_any/", "num_comments": 43, "title": "(+/-)HA-966 - An atypical sedative.

First attempt at 12mg was only slightly perceptible.\n\nI was surprised to begin feeling it after only 10 minutes. First manifested with a rapid antidepressant effect, slight tiredness. Mood is significantly improved. Antidepressant effects continue to grow, after about 30 minutes some sedation and paradoxical stimulantion (perhaps the GHB receptor is involved?). Sedative properties grow, as do anxiolytic properties, and seem to peak after 40 minutes. It has been 63 minutes at the time of writing and i cant see the effect increasing from here. Reminds me of a cross between 1,4-butanediol, ethanol and dextromethorphan. There is some nausea and dizziness, and i could imagine a large dose being potentially quite nauseating. The dizziness seems disproportionate to the inebriated.\n\nI doubt high doses would be euphoric like GHB or its various prodrugs but the relief of anxiety and depression is quite therapeutic and in that regard you might say it could have the sort of recreational that benzos can have. Not as clear headed as I hoped (I feel a bit distracted), and a little inebriated. This limits its therapeutic potential as it would impair driving and overall functioning more so than an equianxiolytic dose of benzodiazepines. This has an antidepressant effect that benzos clearly lack however. 36mg was surprisingly strong, I was originally going to go with 50mg, but im glad I didnt as I don't want to be that incapacitated at the moment. I could see it as a usual alternative to benzodiazepines for acute anxiety with depression. I almost felt like reaching for a benzo this afternoon due to anxiety, and now i have no intention to use one (which is good, because due to past severe benzo dependencies, a single good dose will cause rebound anxiety for days).\n\n***update 1\n\nIts been about 3.25 hours now since the 36mg dose and though i think it is mostly worn off, perhaps some antidepressant properties remain, its hard to say as ive since had 2 beers. What was most striking was the fast acting antidepressant properties. Definitely useful stuff, I'll carry some 30mg doses in my wallet to have as a fast acting anxiolytic/antidepressant for severe anxiety or intractable bad moods that could benefit from pharmacological intervention. Ive noticed 1,4-bd and gbl share this foul mood reversal properties, but have even more nausea and more side-effects (and are hard to store in ones wallet).\n\n****update 2 \n\nAs an update I had an additional 25mg at t+6 hours, then another 60mg at t+8.5. Did help induce sleep but the NMDA-antagonist properties are pretty clearly perceptible at 60mg, which can at the same time make it harder to sleep. As i was laying in bed there were some sinister closed eyed visuals reminiscent of those i get from some dissociatives (particularly nitrous oxide), which consists of colorless metalic-gray forms depicting somewhat violent sexual imagery. Its not the most pleasant thing in the world when you are trying to fall asleep and is clearly characteristic of NMDA-antagonist activity for me. This was eventually followed by sedation. The psychotomimetic properties thus limit its usefulness as a sleep aid for me (as does its 5 hour duration of action), but it holds good promise as an occasional daytime rescue antidepressant or anxiolytic.", "replies": {"fg0zwk6": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/eqcqjb/ha966_an_atypical_sedative_anybody_have_any/fg0zwk6/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1580447044.0, "body": "GHB receptor is not involved.

In both cases, I took it orally on an empty stomach. It took 90 minutes to feel anything, and another hour or two to properly get blasted. Even on 120 mg, the anxiolysis was very evident. I felt at peace with everything, as if I had meditated for several hours or used a sensory deprivation tank.\n\nVisually, there is a little of a dissociative effect where everything seems slightly further away, like a moderate dose of ketamine. There is no dissociative headspace though, no effect on the ego or anything of that sort. Once I properly felt the drug, 3 or 4 hours or so into the experience, there was an entactogen-like body high with plenty of tingles and physical euphoria. There were no entactogen cognitive effects either, however. The muscle relaxation wasn't particularly evident on 120 mg, but on 240 mg I had the soma floppiness, dancing felt wonderful. While the anxiolysis is always there, it took several hours for the euphoria to kick in. It creeps up on you slowly, but reaches a high peak. In terms of cognitive and physical euphoria, this beats almost all depressants, better than GHB, alcohol, or phenibut; it can only be compared to pregabalin and carisprodol. To some extent, the effects seem to come in waves and die down to then kick back up again. Maybe this is because of my alcohol consumption with both experiences and my pregabalin-liver that metabolises ethanol extremely quickly requiring me to pour another. The morning after both experiences I felt sober, but rather relaxed.\n\nOn that note, interactions thus explored are: alcohol, cannabis. Alcohol really makes SL-164 and I wouldn't do it if drinks weren't available. It highly potentiates the euphoria and muslce relaxation transforming SL-164 from merely the perfect anxiolytic to a highly recreational depressant as well. Cannabis and SL-164 is fairly disappointing, as is cannabis and carisoprodol or cannabis and benzodiazepines. Nothing like the sublime synergy weed and pregabalin have, you're just slightly baked but also loose and floppy. I would like to next try SL-164 and pregabalin together, and opioids and SL-164, both of which I expect to be insane. Another experiment I must try in future is dosing the SL-164 repeatedly throughout the day. The half-life of methaqualone is extremely long, 20-60 hours, and I assume SL-164 would be similar. This would mean repeated doses would hopefully have great cumulative effect.\n\nIn terms of reported effects from my friends, my two housemates very much enjoyed the experiences they had which seemed similar to mine, albeit a bit stronger from their descriptions. My girlfriend barely felt it at 120 mg but found 240 mg extremely overwhelming. She began experiencing shakes all over her body which other experience reports have corroborated. These shakes subsided after I administered 10 mg diazepam and 200 mg caffeine. Her short term memory was non-existent and she could not remember the plot of the breaking bad episode we were watching or that I had given her diazepam an hour after administration. She was extremely confused and sedated for about an hour after the shakes began but then began sobering up and felt less overwhelmed. Everyone else I know who has tried it has absolutely loved it, save for one person who said 150 mg was like 100 mg of ketamine. A variety of effects have presented and this drug seems like one that effects everyone differently.\n\nThis chemical is getting a lot of bad press on the reddit experience reports I can find so I would like to provide an alternate opinion. This is an awesome and very interesting chemical and I highly recommend trying it out if you can find some. The muscle shakes other people describe haven't presented in anyone other than my girlfriend, but nobody I know has tried more than 240 mg yet so who knows. I think a good starting dose would be 150-180 mg, and around 200-240 mg is good if you want something stronger. I will be back with updates once I have explored more interactions. If you are into downers, this is definitely one to try out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: As much as I know I'm gonna be lynched for this, I have now tried SL-164 with opioids. Knowing it would take as long to kick in, I took 150 mg 90 minutes before an unknown amount poppy tea and 190 mg of dihydrocodeine along with what ended up totalling 125 mg promethazine dosed throughout the night with poppy tea redoses. It was extremely underwhelming and I would have preferred to take the opioids alone. The slightly dissociative nature of the SL dulled a lot of the physical warmth and pleasure of the opioids and due to the disinhibition I actually managed to feel somewhat melancholy where I was anticipating blissful apathy. This is similar in both the ways in which benzos and opioids as well as dissos and opioids are disappointing, but I had higher hopes due to the pleasant synergy I found existed between opioids and either pregabalin or somas. The combination was not particularly impairing or sedating: Even after my second poppy tea dose, an acquaintance I met believed I was sober until I informed him otherwise and even after my third poppy tea dose I stayed up until 5 AM before waking up of my own accord at 7:30 AM. The combination lacked the euphoria that either SL-164 or opioids possessed when unadulterated. My housemate who took the same combo but without the tea redoses echoed my observations. Alas, opioids simply do not have great synergy with many substances, and this is not a miracle SL-164 can work.

You'll sit in your seat, high as a kite not thinking a damn thing. Completely vacant like some sort of zombie. You will feel annoyed that other people are interrupting your beautiful high. You will feel so perfect you want to do it again. \n\n\nOpioids are the perfect anti-anxiety drug, but in the bad way. They are so good you can't not want to do it more than once. And then you'll rationalize doing it once every few months like MDMA. Then you'll decide once a month is enough time. Then twice a month, because hey you aren't dependent on it, Why not? Then you go to once a week. You still feel relatively fine, and convince yourself that you can keep it to only twice a week. Then three times a week, by now you get a runny nose the day before you dose but chock it up to a cold. Then you end up doing it daily. You might want to go back, but if you try you feel violently ill and in quite a bit of pain. Now you're just using to feel normal, you aren't even high anymore.\n\n\n\n\nPlease take my advice and just enjoy life how it is, you are supposed to be thinking about stuff.

Meaning it is hard to overdose on. The worst experience I had was an amazing supernod where I passed out and tried to start the same movie again. Then passed out again. Literally the only bad thing was missing the movie. It's probably because I mixed it with two benzos, Phenibut, and gabs. Otherwise things are great. Even that \"bad experience\" was warm and cozy. I also actually got a better nights sleep on it than I ever plan to. It has helped me cope with bipolar disorder and PTSD. I normally have at least two manic episodes a week (lasting a day) and correlated with fears of going to sleep and staying asleep. This knocks me out in only a way high dose benzos will do but without the hangover. Literally the morning after my double nod out I had the chillest experience ever at, to or through an airport.\n\nThe reason I took a high dose was because I decided not to travel with it and with tramadol instead because I didn't wanna pack a baggie and snorting scoop. I opted instead for the trams which looked very similar to my Olanzapine. It felt much dirtier and I sought out the strongest kratom extracts once I was in a legal state. It isn't that I don't have kratom at my disposal it's just that once you're at the ceiling there are bad gastrointestinal effects not true with 2map. Trams are the second treatment I've tried to be dual opiate agonists and work on seritonin.\n\n There have been trials on Tramadol and Tianeptine, and some have been successful and Tianeptine is an approved anti-depressant in several countries but never on a full scale opioid. Tramadol would probably never work in opioid doses for depression as it leads to a dirty mental fog. O-DSMT is the chem I have now and it's only slightly cleaner with a better duration.\n2map's major downfall is it's short duration. You have to redose after 3 or so hours. But the same is true with Tianeptine.\n\nThere are other benefits.\nOn 2 repeated doses of both of us taking 20mg each intranasally, NYE was a magical evening with a girl I only kinda knew. At least for that night I knew her much better and I probably owe it to this chem. \n\nAlso sex on this stuff and a small dose of amps (RC or otherwise) is great because the amps increase sensation and 2map allows you to last n last and women can have multiples during. (I believe this stuff is only a sexual enhancer for men and only when combined with amps. Women may get enhancement from this opioid as well but for them it's mostly the amps.\n\nThe 2 biggest problems with opioids are that they are fatal and how they are illegal. My first only somewhat careful experiences with this chem were very forgiving as I didn't skimp on the rest of my complex cocktail but it enhanced it in ways that were harmless. I had good conversations, was sub euphoric happy or completely euphoric with seemingly anyone and everyone. Even if I'd dosed a bit too much. So that makes this rather safe compared to other opioids. The other pesky part of opioids is the illegality of them.\n\n2-Methyl-AP-237 is federally uncontrolled and 5 state legal as it is only an analog of a Chinese cancer drug Buccinazine which is also uncontrolled.\n\nI dare say that if taken with restraint only 4 days a week that this drug should be considered an antidepressant nootropic. Much like Tianeptine. However Tianeptine WD is often worse than heroins and the WD from 2map is only as bad as morphine WD. Some food for thought is how Suboxone allows former addicts to live normal lives even while treated with subs. If 2map stays classed the way it is, people with complex mental disorders may lead more normal lives as well.\n\nNext up for hot take Monday: Etizolam when not abused is as effective as any benzo.\n\nAlso Clonazolam in low doses may combat both depression and anxiety\n\nEdit: Also no need to go onion farming. 2map, etiz gs and clam gs are incredibly easy to find clearnet!", "author": "StoopSign", "score": 8, "flair": null, "created": 1580780148.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/eyam5b/update_2methylap237_is_my_new_favorite_rc/", "num_comments": 36, "title": "Update: 2-Methyl-AP-237 is my new favorite RC", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fghd0b2": {"score": 6, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/eyam5b/update_2methylap237_is_my_new_favorite_rc/fghd0b2/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1580810898.0, "body": "Everyone says it\u2019s garbage, but I completely disagree.

And let's be honest, it's the same if you start taking o-dsmt or carfentanyl - Using opi will lead to an addiction. And there is nothing wrong, if you can financially afford this.\n\nI've trield almost opiates and opioids that can be easily found. Oxycodone was for me the almost perfect opi, and oxymorphone was simply the gourmet of oxy. Even with this middle-range opi, anyway I noticed fow your interested to things you love , hobbies, libido, etc reduces. And you need to have a planned live knowing if you need to go to holiday you would not be on wd for days.

Not that Fu-F or IBF where bad - I enjoyed them, was my first \"noding\" time (I prefer the euphoria for stims). But from the idea of doing it only the weekend became a daily thing. And I realized I lost all my other interest. Then even more blind I researched other even more stronger RCs, risking even to die. I was definitely no iny myself anymore. Whatever, now i seeked medical help and I am fine, on subu for a few month. But I am saying drugs are bad and ill continue my resarch, just I will stick to potency compounds (10.15x morphine) I know I will have a daily addiction, but at least I will be still in control and decide when to take some breaks.\n\nWiillpower is a key point for anyone starting with opi. And moderation, because you risk to die lot more easily by overdosing.

I do suffer quite badly from gernealized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder.  Now I know stimulants are not the best choice for people like me who suffer badly from Anxiety and Panic.  But having said that, When I did mess around with Dexedrine, Adderall,  and Methamphetamine, I was usually always fine because I always kept my doses low and very sporadicly.  And I always usually had some benzos on end, like diazepam or clonazepam incase I did have a bad panic attack.\n\nI haven't had benzos for awhile, but I do currently have a small amount of Etizolam.

Most of these have gotten a lot of reviews, but a couple of more couldn't hurt! All these ratings are in the context of depressants, not all drugs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEtizolam: 4/5. At 1 mg, this is a fast acting, pretty potent benzo that does a great job at relieving anxiety and providing a bit of euphoria. At 2 mg, definitely has a \"Drunken\" feel to it, but also more clear headed than alcohol. Widely considered one of the less addictive benzos, it's not something I'd use often, I do have some that I plan on keeping as a \"trip reducer\", as 1mg is enough to diminish trip anxiety without really killing a trip too much IMO. Edit: Forgot to mention that if you combine this with 1-2 alcoholic beverages, it's the best of being drunk and etiz rolled into one. Definitely be careful though, as I wouldn't go past 2 drinks for fear of blacking out.\n\nFlualprazolam: 4/5. Similar to Etiz but much stronger. At 1mg, definitely very intoxicated. Nice muscle relaxant properties, pretty euphoric and also lasts a bit into the next day. I tried 1.5 mg once and passed out. All in all seems like it could be more addictive than etiz, not planning on trying again but was a pretty good time.\n\nO-dsmt: 2/5. Before anyone gets angry that I put an opioid here, let me say that sometimes opioids are classified as depressants, so in here it goes. I wasn't a huge fan of this for recreational purposes, at 50 mg it didn't feel super strong. I might be a non responder, I have no tolerance though. I tried kicking it up to 100mg, which was definitely better but I didn't seem to really get it that much. I will say that it had some good pain relieving properties, I had a sunburn once when I took it but forgot about it for a couple of hours until it came back as the o-dsmt was wearing off. I tried it with pot one other time, as I heard that it was synergistic, and I will say that that was a 3.5/5. It felt like a better marijuana high than anything though, a bit less anxiety than normal. Probably won't try again. Oh, also this made me kinda itchy.\n\nPhenibut: 4.5/5. I prefer this in lower doses than most people, around 750mg. At higher doses it gives me a headache, and also I like using this socially and I feel like high dosages aren't great for that. At 750mg, and with caffeine at the peak, this is a really spectacular drug. Makes music sound amazing, loosens inhibitions, lowers anxiety, long lasting, pretty euphoric. I keep this to once a week max, as it definitely has addictive properties. But boy oh boy does it feel great.\n\nAniracetam: 3/5. I know that this is considered a nootropic, but some people also consider it a rc which is good enough for me. Definitely has anxiety reducing properties maybe similar to like a quarter mg of etiz, while also helping you focus a bit. It's also much safer (probably) than most rc drugs, so a good option if you want something mild to use occasionally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's it! If this is well received I'll do one about rc stimulants next. If anyone has any questions about any of this I'll be happy to answer. If you have similar tastes to me and want to recommend anything, that would also be appreciated. I'm looking into trying some slightly more obscure one's, but I'm staying away from things like c-lam because I don't want anything too addictive, or anything with a bad comedown either.

I am walking alongside the river, I have no recall of language, of who I am, of my past or my present. I am on a mission to go on a picnic so I keep walking. I start seeing children playing around so I keep telling myself \"no weird in front of children\" made me giggle like a schoolgirl.\n\nt=1:30 - life is good, I'm the type of person that can recall events on all drugs unless I reach a point of a dangerous blackout, so I can remember my experience very accurately. my thoughts we beautiful, calm but confused in a weird good way. the visuals are INSANE, really beautiful patterns everywhere. I kept nodding at everyone that passes by for some reason but it felt good.\n\nt=2:00 - the world is still changing colours, like an RGB keyboard. everything is so colourful and beautiful. something to point out is I had no understanding of violent or fear, I was in bliss, until I saw the police arrest a guy. It made me feel confused, why would people do violent things? I start to recollect the idea of \"the law\" and of \"crime\" and figured I need to keep myself protected. It didn't ruin my trip, just gave me something to think about.\n\nt=4:00 - the mental trip is nearly over, I have fully regained my memory and my ability to speak my 2 languages fluently. I felt some sadness, some anger I didn't understand. maybe its because i realised the mindstate on psychedelics is just a fantasy. real talk, I have never felt relief from the reality on any drug, not benzos, not opioids, not stims, not dissos, always reality is there. on psychedelics, especially this one I took a beautiful break from ALL of it. I wasn't here.\n\nconclusion: AMAZING experience. will be trying DOC next week. will save my 4-ho-MiPT for the summer when all my uni shit and stress is over to do it with my brother. the head-space is heavily present, but not heavy.

Completely forgot about that thank you for reminding me.", "replies": {}}}}}}, "ev6ta8": {"text": "Title: \"\\[---\\]\\*which\\* combos can you recommend?\"\n\nBecause I go to a Spa that also has many Sauna's every now and then and also like to Meditate in Saunas, sometimes listen to ASMR for relaxation purposes and furthermore also like to combine either one of those or the three or two of them together with various drugs, I figured I'd ask you guys if you have tried this, like this, and what your favorite combinations are.\n\nSmall disclaimer: As for going to a sauna, if you have a weak heart or circulation, please be aware that a combination of sauna + drugs might be very dangerous for you or even kill you in extreme cases. Also, even relatively healthy people might fall asleep in a sauna on drugs and if you are alone that also might be quite detrimental.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI first had the Idea on Opiates, and started to listen to ASMR Audio on Opiates (which I highly recommend for anyone who likes ASMR for sleeping or relaxation). After I started getting into meditation and a certain method of mental calmness and stoicism inspired by a book I read I also tried combining these. Lately I have been to a sauna more often and had also been doing Benzos and Opiates at the time. I know that it can be harsh on your heart/circulation but since I like taking an occasional risk and never face any problems with long (>/=15 min) sessions of being in >90\u00b0C Saunas I first tried Clonazepam in a Sauna + Meditation, then Kratom, Benzos and a sip of Whiskey with Sauna and Meditation.\n\nBoth experiences were great and I had no problems with my circulation, but I can very well imagine that especially the last one really is not too good for your heart (while sauna generally is considered to be good for your circulation) and I think I stayed to long in a 95\u00b0C Sauna because I could not feel Pain because of the Kratom. However I was good, even after a second session with the second combo on the same evening, what ruined it in the end was the decision to (after taking a short swim in an ice bath) smoke nicotine. I ended up with a fucked up stomach and while I did not vomit it still kind of ruined the rest of the evening. But the rest of the experience was very nice. So if you dare and trust in your circulation, I can recommend it.\n\nIt really was kind of spiritual & Psychedelic to meditate in such a hot sauna for 20min's on Opioids and Benzos, I rarely felt so deeply relaxed. I really want to try this with Dissociatives (low to mediocre dose). Also note that I have only once during these experiences have been alone in the sauna and even then only for a short period of time. Be sure to have someone around even if its someone you dont know, they'll pick you up if you stop sitting and start falling into yourself in a sauna (But you should not rely on a person you dont know, that also really is far from morally OK).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso Psychedelics + Meditation is very cool. Whilst I've never experienced any spiritual experience with mere meditation, I made some interesting discoveries whilst meditating on psychedelics. I recommend you give that one a try. Dissociatives also really have a neat combination with meditation, especially at those not quite but almost hole doses where your body starts to dissolve in music or thoughts while you could theoretically still open your eye's / move even though your body is numb.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll end this post with a Table of the combinations I tried. Please let me know about any experiences you made and comment if you have a recommendation for me and other fellow researchers to try.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Drugs / Relaxing Practices|Sauna|Meditation|ASMR|Sauna & Meditation|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Opioids/Opiates|Take care, really enjoyable nevertheless.|Adds a nice touch, but nothing too special really|Really Cool, the Drug & Practice both enhance each other.|Almost spiritual. Very pleasant and worth a try, but be aware of the dangers.|\n|Benzos|Extra relaxing, you might fall asleep though, so take care.|Not recommended, just meditate and take benzos afterwards, it takes something away.|Nothing special really, you'll probably fall asleep in seconds.|Extra relaxing, you might fall asleep though, so take care. Benzos take away some of the Meditations \"Magic\"|\n|Dissociatives|Haven't tried it yet, want to though. Might be dangerous.|Very interesting & intense. Recommended.|Interesting once, but nothing too special.|Not tried either. Caution.|\n|Psychedelics|I really want to try this, but sadly have not. This also might be not very safe depending on your experience level and circulation.|Very spiritual but in higher doses its very hard to keep up the process of watching your thoughts flow by.|I did not like it, some of you might, worth trying though.|I also really want to try this, but sadly have not. This also might be not very safe depending on your experience level and circulation.|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, for the post in r/researchemicals : If you are wondering why am I posting this in r/researchchemicals and not (just) r/Drugs ? Well, because imo this subreddit is more dedicated towards drugs, I feel like the community is more into stuff like this.  Also I only tried these with RC-Dissociatives, although Id like to try some normal Ketamine in a Sauna, sounds worth a try.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not rely on this as info for safety of these combos. Im not sure whether most people will have as little of an amount of problems with sauna + drugs (especially downers) as I had, also, if you like the Idea, please remember to upvote. I'm often frustrated when people like posts and their Ideas but forget to upvote and therefore few people get to see the post. I'd really like these Ideas to be spread, because many are worth trying. Not directly asking, if you dont like it downvote / dont vote do whatever you want, just wanted to remind people because I also often forget to upvote interesting posts I see although I comment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading until here, keep on researching fellow researchers.\n\nDeus vult nos quaerere !", "author": "G1nnnn", "score": 24, "flair": null, "created": 1580253164.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/ev6ta8/do_you_like_relaxing_thingsmethods_like_visiting/", "num_comments": 31, "title": "Do you like relaxing Things/Methods like visiting a Sauna, Asmr, Meditation etc. with Drugs ?

I don\u2019t feel lots of vasoconstriction and it feels relatively safe, also sert activity feels non existent... I feel motivated,primed and ready. Bonus, albeit not feeling any kind of sert acrivity I feel chatty and empathic but not in a forceful way. Wonder if this could be a replacement for PTSD patients cause there are still no evidences it can be neurotoxic. I am not even sweating that much and my temperature is as \u201clow\u201d as 37.8\u00b0C. Probably cathinones with a methylene deoxy moiety would be more suitable for PTSD patients, however the reason why MAPS sticked to MDMA is probably because MDMA doesn\u2019t give this monstrous compulsive redosing.

I am CaptainEtazene and I'd like to write something about etazene.First of all, it is a very strong opioid. It differs slightly in action from classic opioids. It is a molecular speedball. If you take little, you feel everything at once: euphoria, speed and relaxation. If you take more, euphoria is growing, but the opiate action profile is getting stronger, until you finally fall into opioid drowsiness. Compared to isotonitazene and fentanyl, it was hardly seen to cause respiratory depression. Removal of the nitro group [https://imgur.com/in8mfuX](https://imgur.com/in8mfuX) from etonitazene caused smaller respiratory depression, less hypnotic properties and increased speedball effect.After that, you can work normally and be even more productive than when being sober. Just don't overdo with dose. Small doses - euphoric; high doses - heavy opioid.\n\n*How to dose it?* For total opioid beginner: 0.5-1 mg per spray in nasal spray, causes high euphoria and a feeling of soft legs. 1.5-3 mg already makes you fall asleep.\u00a0 When someone took 30 mg of pure he vomited, went on all fours but was happy.\n\n*How about tolerance?* It grows terribly fast. Within a few days, the dose to be taken to obtain the desired effect can increase several times. There's cross tolerance with other opiates.**The important thing is that a dose depends on the method of administration and what etazene is administered with**!!! For some routes of administration higher dose is needed! Ask your vendor which administration route is best to use for a given etazene product.

Then you might both try Girl Scout Cookies and notice that it fries your brain like nothing you've ever had before, but also somehow doesn't give you any anxiety, but your friend complains that  the anxiety was horrific for him.\n\nCannabis is all about the nuances, strain by strain. Sativa is often more cerebral (ie: anxiety-inducing, CNS upper), and indica is often more physical (ie: couch-lock, CNS downer), but there also exists many many strains that are hybrids, so the only thing you can do as a rational person is pay very close attention to strains and their CBD/THC amounts.\n\nOnce you find a strain you like, keep on it. It would be nice to find a few strains that treat your spinal anomalies well. For example, some strains might relieve all pain and also alleviate stomach nausea. I'm sure there's a super magical strain out there for you.\n\nAs with exercise, listen to your body. Each strain will be different, so what your friends and internet say may or may not apply to you. There's hundreds of strains.\n\nThere's also a difference between smoked and ingested cannabis. I can't remember exactly, but ingested cannabis generates one additional psychoactive compound as it passes through your liver, so this will change your phenotype's response to the same strain via smoked or ingested.\n\nAw yea, we science now; and of course, keep in mind that no one has died causally-linked to cannabis for the last 4000 years. It is a compound well-tolerated in the human body, so in my opinion, you can approach THC in a calm manner. Maybe you can even mix 2+ strains together to create your own proprietary spinal-dominator mix.

I don't understand their pharmacology, and I refuse to research them due to the physical dependency, essentially a ramping dependency and some are active at such small amounts that accidental LD50 is a concern from respiratory depression.\n\n\nThere's been peer-reviewed articles coming out lately showing that they have discovered new pain-related pathways. For example, there is an entire lattice network under the skin that relates to pain, and they also found some neural area that turns off pain. This is infantile yet extremely promising as the level of precision for pain suppression is likely going to accelerate significantly \"soon\".\n\nSo therefore, I think you should rationally hold out as long as possible for euthanasia.\n\nAnd a weird side note, but there is a lot of paradoxical observations depending how and where you consume data in this current age. Most algorithms are tuned as a kind of echo-chamber, so if you write comments on YouTube or exceed threshold on dwell time metrics in wall-feed sites like Reddit and Twitter, they will show you more content related to that.\n\nIt's a problem because, in general the world is getting safer, less poverty, better education, everything is gaining exponentially, but there is paradoxical observations because popular news is defined by shocking negative events, so those are prioritized. It makes it look like the world is doing bad--or worse than actuality.\n\nSome of this logic is extremely important for you to understand as you seek to rationalize your position and to make decisions based on your observations.\n\nPart of what I'm trying to say here is that there is a huge difference between 'engagement' and 'enjoyment'. Current algorithms are mostly designed to maximize engagement, which means social mediums are capitalizing on dopamine pathways to trigger addictive behaviour related to your focus and focal points. They are not designed to give you fulfillment or enjoyment, but to consume your time.\n\nI personally consider it ethical for you to discover what medicates you and helps you avoid going too nihililistic.

Tell yourself you are going to walk again, and 24/7 push all the positive energy you can towards the exact place in your spinal code where you need regeneration to occur.\n\nWhen I say this, I mean imagine the mind-muscle connection. Try to hack the system and see if you can figure out how to \"work out\" your lower back and hips, glutes, quads, hamstrings, calves, abs. People will call it physiotherapy, but what I'm talking about is hacking the system so your muscle don't atrophy as much as they might otherwise. If you flex your abs, you will stimulate blood flow into a region nearby your spinal cord. This cannot be a bad thing.\n\nI've read accounts before of people with back injuries regaining the ability to walk again simply because they didn't give up. Their body pulled a miracle situation.\n\nWhat remains constant here is that your muscles work by signalling, but your tissues also survive by oxygen and nutrients, so I'm talking about fostering a good environment inside your body by doing things that relates to \"oxygen-delivery\" and \"nutrient-delivery\" and \"anaerobic function\". This relates to your respiratory system and cardiovascular system.\n\nGet into the habit of massaging your lower back like 200 times a day to stimulate bloodflow. Learn what supplements you could take that relate to nerve growth. I can tell you that LSD is one of them.\n\nShit maybe I can give you some baller tips here, one sec. There is a podcast here you need to watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPqWstVnRjQ Watch the whole thing and pay attention every time he namedrops specific types of mushrooms that have bearing on neurochemistry.\n\nFor example, he will mention stuff like cordyceps, lion's mane, ricci, so you need to understand exactly how this is relevant to your interests. He will also talk about psychedelics such as psilocybin and LSD as stimulating  neurogenesis. And don't forget that he also says to supplement flushing niacin (not flush-free niacin) because of its bearing on vasodilation and therefore bloodflow.\n\nI can link you a couple articles too. Check out this one: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/06/180612185207.htm\nStudy what kind of keywords are being utilized in there, and figure out how you can use them to your advantage.\n\nFigure out what else you can do from your home. There's nothing stopping you from spending significant time researching topics just as anyone would at medical school. Your brain is the only tool you need. You could master the subject and use yourself as a test mule, even conducting experiments that might take 6-12 months to see if it had any affect :)\n\nPersonally, I've always been interested in neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. See what you can do with those keywords and \"mushrooms\". Also shiitake mushrooms are another one. Don't forget that mushrooms are a kind of brain that lives in the soil.

It is a natural energy, I feel recharged, more grounded, it is not that jittery push of amphetamines, it is a clear headed, natural focus.Overall, it seems to me that the chemical mix that gets released in the brain is awesome.I forgot to mention, microdoses of LSD are awesome for this purpose, it is a waste of dose for me if I dont go jogging or cycling when microdosing.I tried doing it on a low doses of amphs like 2-fma, but then I have a feeling that I am straining the heart too much, it does not feel right exercising vigorously on amphetamines.\n\nAnyway, what I am trying to say is that this chemical mix feels awesome to me, and I have not really replicated it with chemicals so far. There is a psychological component to it, it feels earned, deserved. I wonder what chemical combo would replicate it, maybe a low dose of a clean stimulant like meth (when you have no tolerance) armodafinil or 2-fma, low dose of of high class opiate like oxy or something (I have no real experience) and maybe a moderate dose of CBD.

So far hanging tight but been dealing with a lot of physical and mental withdrawal symptoms, the physical being quite surprising as many will tell you there should be none. In my case they are wrong. The physical are pretty bad and have persisted for many days.\n\nFor this guy it was so bad he had to go into the ICU using Ketamine (although a pretty large amount):\n\n[http://www.jnsci.org/files/html/2017/e450.htm](http://www.jnsci.org/files/html/2017/e450.htm)\n\nThe issue you have to deal with is the rebound hyperglutamatergic effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists. Quoted from the article:\n\n'Given that ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist, it is plausible that discontinuation could result in a glutamate rebound, leading to hyperexcitation and agitation.'\n\nYup - got that going on. Kind of like trying to kick a daily alcohol habit. Been there.\n\nThis case is one of the very few that talks about the very real physical withdrawal symptoms that emerge.\n\nNow how to deal with this in the most natural way possible. First let's look at the list of NMDA receptor antagonists:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA\\_receptor\\_antagonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor_antagonist)\n\nOK so I've got a few of those and ordered the ones I do not have. I won't go into why each of these is important but read the wikipedia article for more information.\n\n**Recommended**:\n\n**Legal and OTC:**\n\n1. Agmatine -  Blocks NMDA receptors and other cation ligand-gated channels. Can also potentiate opioid analgesia.\n2. Magnesium - [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201410/magnesium-and-the-ketamine-connection](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201410/magnesium-and-the-ketamine-connection)\n3. L-Phenylalanine -  a naturally occurring [amino acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid) (equilibrium dissociation constant (KB) from Schild regression is 573 \u03bcM[\\[62\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor_antagonist#cite_note-62)).\n4. Huperzine-A - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huperzine\\_A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huperzine_A)\n5. Black Seed Oil (Thymoquinone)  - [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2018.00236/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2018.00236/full)\n\n**Perscription**\n\n1. Gabapentin - It's unscheduled - should be very easy to get a script - look for 900mg a day at least - 3 300mg pills as you want to stagger your doses. Or Lyrica (which is an upgraded version) but scripted so might be harder.\n2. Long Acting Benzos - Klonopin, etc - probably the most helpful thing to get past the agitation and insomnia if you can get it. If things are really bad you can likely get a script by discussing the covid lockdown and insane anxiety it is causes. The longer acting benzos are easier to get off.\n\n**Research Chemicals**\n\n1. Etizolam - Not really a research chemical but still widely available. Very useful for short term use especially if you cannot get a script. Seems to have less addiction potential compared to full benzos (but that is arguable).\n2. Norflurazepam - Very strong and long acting - again an option if you cannot get a script - be very careful however with this - I thought I killed my wife the other day with this stuff. She had no benzo tolerance and was out for almost 18 hours.\n\n**Things to Avoid:**\n\n1. [Dextromethorphan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextromethorphan) (DXM) -   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextromethorphan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextromethorphan) \\- It works but can be just as addictive - also lowers inhibitions to start up your habit - I've found best to steer clear\n2.

Bulk of the text explains my experience and reasons for my opinions) \n\nI don\u2019t have a tolerance. I use Kratom maybe once in a week or two. I used to have a tolerance of 1 mg/day carfentanil (500 \u03bcg once every 12 hours IV), so I ussseed to think opioids would never work for me again. So not true. I just needed to wait years to be back at baseline haha. \n\nI dosed 84 mg about 3 hours ago. Boy. I\u2019m not doing this for real recreation. Just some neck pain. Not going to be an every day or redose thing, which is why I didn\u2019t go 2map or the other one. Don\u2019t care about a rush.\n\nItches are just right. Just enough to make me happy about an opioid again. I do like them a little bit, but I\u2019m gonna take 25 mg hydroxyzine alongside it (at the time of this post, +3 hrs into it). The neck pain is totally gone. As if it wasn\u2019t there to begin with. I was able to massage the muscles, because muscle relaxers weren\u2019t cutting it. Needed to block the pain to do it. \n\nThe \u201ceuphoria\u201d is there. I am happy. I feel good. A lot of this has to do with being happy about the effects working as I hoped and the stress and pain it therefore relieves. But I do feel like there\u2019s a bonus on top. If I took more, I\u2019d probably nod. It feels very good. But that\u2019s not my goal so I won\u2019t be testing that theory. For general pain relief and functionality, this dose is perfect for me. I can\u2019t believe it. Tramadol is so shit too; I had no idea one of its metabolites was so wonderful. Why isn\u2019t this used instead? The fuck is wrong with the medical community hahahaha. \n\nDo you guys have similar opinions and effects as me? Is it as medically efficacious while retaining some of that fun recreational side. It\u2019s not oxymorpone. But it is so much better than how I felt three hours ago. Medically, if it didn\u2019t have any of the traditional recreational side effects as other opioids, I\u2019d STILL love it because I can read (and opioids make me want to read all the books) and work. I\u2019m an artist and it doesn\u2019t cause any problems. Makes it easier since my neck was causing issues with that. \n\nI pray this stays off the banhammer radar for the foreseeable future. I may get 50 g or so to put in a safe. Nothing I\u2019d use every day, but it would prevent a trip to the doctor for a prescription if I needed it. Yep. Wow. Just amazed. I went in with all the hopes in the world, and zero expectations. Every hope was met. It seems like the duration will be perfect too, since it only seems to be getting a little stronger. No sign of a plateau and comedown at all yet. \n\nWhat an awesome drug. Better than kratom in nearly every way (but kratom does boost my mood/help my depression a lot more than this. Idc. This helps my pain entirely). \n\nThanks for reading, guys. Wanted to share my opinion with the community. :) \n\nTl;dr: If someone is on the bench looking for pain relief, and can\u2019t decide, this is a good choice for an all around opioid. Not too sedating. Not TOO much euphoria you can\u2019t work, but there is enough there that if you just took a little more, I can imagine it getting intense enough to interfere with productivity.\n\nDrugs and doses used:\n\n-84 mg O-DSMT HCl\n-25 mg hydroxyzine pamoate \n-1 g phenibut HCl (17 hours before O-DSMT dose)\n-2 mg clonazepam (12 hours before O-DSMT dose)\n-Cannabis (full spectrum concentrate in a vape cartridge.

When I first used it, 20mg was more than enough to provide a meaningful, interesting, insightful and challenging trip. Now, I need to use 70-150mg in order to get any effect at all, and regardless of dose, they no longer provide the same mental health benefits that they used to. I now only experience mild music and sociability enhancement, and a mildly enhanced emotional state from 4-AcO-DMT. The headspace is far less interesting and challenging than even cannabis for me at this point. \n\nFurthermore, the side effects, particularly body load have become so unbearable that I can no longer use the substance much at all. The physical symptoms I experience when tripping seem to mimic opioid (Tianeptine) withdrawal, but far worse. These include extreme restlessness, chills, sweating, shaking, random muscle twitches, runny nose, watery eyes, and goosebumps. Every time I trip, during the comedown I am forced to seriously consider admitting myself to a mental hospital as I experience psychosis-like symptoms, and not the fun kind. These include hearing voices, talking to myself, and pacing in circles. This is much different than having a \u201cbad trip\u201d; the headspace has become so boring it has become impossible for me to have a bad trio even if I try. It feels like the worst stimulant comedown I have ever experienced, both physically and mentally. The wonderful afterglow I used to experience has been replaced with an awful comedown and hangover in the day or two following the trip.\n\nOn average, I trip once every 2 weeks but have taken over a month off on several times with no effect on tolerance. Also, I recently quit a 2g per day Tianeptine addiction a month ago, and it seems like once I started Tianeptine psychedelics have never worked properly again, even after quitting. Since then, psychedelics have seemed to mostly bring back acute opioid withdrawal symptoms as well as **intense** cravings which I have never experienced before. This is despite me having no acute or post acute withdrawal symptoms currently\n\nI am wondering if there is any way I can help reduce my psychedelic tolerance, or if the positive effects will ever return in the future.

I have heard of others experiencing problems with stimulants after abusing them, even with years of abstinence in between. Every other class feels normal now except I think I killed the magic of DXM and Phenibut permanently just by using them too often (once every week or two for DXM, twice a week for Phenibut). But in neither of those cases did I experience increased side effects at all, just less interesting and enjoyable at all. \n\nI think the problem is I would always push my drug use to the maximum possible amount one is technically supposed to use the substance. For example since technically tryptamine tolerance is supposed to take 1-2 weeks to reset, there were times earlier on where I would be using at that frequency for extended periods of time, although recently it\u2019s been at least 2 weeks between trips. \n\nI think there is something about drug tolerance that stretches beyond the normal receptor up/downregulation which takes longer to reset and is more permanent than traditional tolerance. So I think for example the \u201c1-2 weeks between trips\u201d guideline is the minimum you can safely use without building physical tolerance, but doing so for extended periods of time will cause other issues like what I\u2019m describing. Another user here messaged me saying he\u2019s experienced something similar for other drug classes he\u2019s used too frequently which seems permanent. \n\nI guess the lesson is to always air on the side of caution and don\u2019t get sucked into just rotating classes of drugs around to simply avoid physical dependence and tolerance. That\u2019s what I did for a long time and although I was rarely dependent on any one drug, I was pretty much a classic case of poly drug addiction. I suspect that all of our neurotransmitter systems are so interconnected that simply using lots of drugs in general can have some kind of effect on how the brain processes substances.

I feel they offer insight into the relationship between material and consciousness moreso than the classics alone (recently learned the term SAR, structure-activity-relationship, very good.) I can't say I prefer them to the classics. Take it on a case by case basis. But I am generally more interested in RC's. Favorite atm is 2fdck, curious about dissos but postponing gratification.

Don't know enough chemistry to speak further without demonstrating ignorance, or perhaps I already have. Idgaf, educate me. That's why I'm here. I'm curious about tryptamines, phenethylamines, and benzofurans, though I've tried no such RC's. Caths, benzos, and opioids have no place. I use because I crave novel experience.

Additionally, I'm not an expert of any sort, just an addict. Do not use my anecdotal information to make a decision that could end your life. Do more research than just a reddit post as well.\n\nHey OP. I feel like some people in this post haven\u2019t been too helpful and honestly kind of dick-ish. I just wanna give you some information and some of my opinions. I\u2019m in no way any sort of professional, and what I do for myself is just as much of a guess and risk as what you do and isn\u2019t meant to be a suggestion but merely a story I guess.\n\n\\*\\*Yes you absolutely can overdose on AP238. I assume this out of caution of every opiate I consume and as of recentlly started carrying Narcan with me just in case. I haven\u2019t heard of an opiate yet that you could not overdose on\\*\\*\n\nI remind myself every time I get the urge to do more  of any opiate that I can always do more but never less. I don\u2019t have a scale\u00a0until tomorrow\u00a0when I can go tk the store but after that I\u2019ll be good. Now, I will admit that while I have solid knowledge of harm reduction strategies That I don't practice them to the extent I should. So I don't want to give anyone the impression that they are fine only doing the bare minimum I do, I've just gotten lucky so far to be honest. I don't use test kits for any of my drugs but I do recommend that to anyone using any illicit drugs.\n\nCarrying Narcan with me is really due to knowing two people who overdosed this year (one survived, one passed) on opiates and because after a hiatus and some rehab programs I'm back to them as well. And that is why I am as careful as I can be while using them.\n\nLet\u2019s start with some context.\n\nI, too, acquired some AP238 in the past couple days and have been experimenting a little with solo use and interactions\n\nMe: I'm in my 20s, 6\u20190 , \\~130 lbs\n\nHow much I\u2019ve taken today total:\n\n* Clonazolam 6.75mg\n* AP238 (unknown dose. I don\u2019t have a scale and heard that it was, in some random redditor's opinion, \\~1.5x more potent than oxy so I basically racked up what looked like a line I\u2019d usually take of my areas shitty fent laced percocet and then snorted 1/3 of it. Perfect dose for me, who last had those percs in April 2020. Also i dont know how many lines of it I;ve had today and one more sitting next to me but they have been small like i said maybe a half inch and thin.\n* THC (Probably about 500mg of oil, I smoked in moderation throughout the day with a wax pen and split a joint with a homie arouns 5am)\n* Methamphetamine (no idea on mgs. new user. I've probably had four one inch long lines of it today between 530am and \\~\\~well I've got a fifth one sitting next to me\\~\\~ I just took \\~\\~another\\~\\~ \\~\\~a sixth\\~\\~ a seventh now right now at 11pm while writing this comment)\n\nI have been using both clonazolam and ap238 all day andlasty night and I have felt fine. When I say fine i compare it to when I took 10mg clonazolam and snorted a totasally eyeballed (int he dark) potentially lethal dose of percocet after which I couldn't walk without holding a wall and I couldnt hold objects or see much of anything at all. I also had no idea where I was and couldn't keep my phone in my hand long enough to call for help i just kept dropping it. This all may sound like quite personal stories but I tell them in hopes to deter you fromm aming harmful mistakes that I have made. So in large doses the mixture of benzos and opiates is dangerous. Each drug class alone can induce respiratory depression in high doses and therefore ther chances of it killing you are higher with bth drugsin your system. Additionally, at least for me. I get quite confused on large doses of benzos and have almost zero inhibition for the amount of drugs I do, even if I'm somewhat aware it's been haphazardly dosed and could hurt me. If you're like me then this mixture is especially dangerous. But today I was taking them in s maller doses. I believe I started around like 130am with a line of the ap238 (feeling equivalent to \\~7.5mg pressed percs imo) and then took 1mg clonazolam  it felt divine to me, but I've got a bias being both a benzo and opiate addict. But I didn't feel any negative side effects at those doses. The issue with me when I've done this in the pas is as previously stated, benzos cause ,e to lose ability to control drug use. I wouldn't getting into mixing therm If I were you. The drugs feel great separately and its an unnecessary risk just for  different feeling. I took one full 2mg bar of clonazoam at 7:50pm and then for actual pain relief reasons two small bumps of ap238 around 8:12. I felt okay at the time and felt that the dosages were small enough to not matter and, as I said, \\*LUCKILY\\* I was right. I've got experience with lots of different kinds of drugs and have plenty of book knowledge on lots of drugs but it only takes one mistake.\n\nI may update this with some more reliable measurements when i get  scale tomorrow as even though this is all anecdotal it may help people to compare it to.\n\nDid you ever try either or both of them together? How did it go? Would love to heaar.

Since I'm on SSRIs (venlafaxine), I'm assuming that most serotonergic based tryptamines and \"MDMA-like\" compounds would be a waste of time. I have a bit of a benzo habit, mostly taking flualprazolam (although I may need to switch to something like clonazolam if the WHO ban becomes enforced in the US).\n\nI don't have any opioid tolerance so I am wary of all these potent opioid RCs on the scene lately. The only one that would interest me is O-DSMT, which I tried a few years ago with positive effects. Or is it better to just not go down the opioid rabbit hole in the first place?\n\nSynthetic cannabinoids sound interesting, but I'm a bit wary as to their extremely high potency and potential for harmful effects. How do you even dose them? Volumetric dosing is a given, but I've never vaped anything before so I don't really know what hardware you'd need. Is this another rabbit hole I'd be better not going down?\n\nAs far as stimulants are concerned, I'm prescribed 60mg Adderall per day so I have a decent tolerance. I haven't really tried any RC stims aside from 3-FPM. I did try isopropyphenidate and 2-FMA a few years ago but don't remember whether I liked them that much. I'd mostly be looking for a \"functional\" stim - definitely nothing like a pyro that would have me fiendishly redosing. Would 3-FPM be my best bet?

What would you recommend?\n\nFinally, dissociatives - I had MXE way back in the day and really enjoyed it, but of course that's not available anymore.

This seems to give them the capacity to be incredibly deep without having that euphoria that distorts your perception. I think that traditional psychedelics have the ability to lead you astray because they act like a truth serum, making everything seem true even when it's not completely true or there is more nuance to it. I don't like that part about traditional psychedelics because they almost seem demonic in nature because they can make you believe certain things that might sound good on paper, but are not truly good.

Well, just dissolve a little more than you plan on taking and drink it very slowly and you'll get longer action. I found O-DSMT to be much too stimulating and not as euphoric as 2MAP.

I first was introduced to RCs when I was around 16 and buying JWH-XXX\u2019s because they were very cheap and accessible. In retrospect I was far too young to even be consuming psychoactive chemicals, much less synthetic cannabinoids. That continued for probably about a year until I started doing opiates more frequently and by 18 I could snort 3 roxi 30\u2019s and barely get a buzz and by 19 I was a full blown iv heroin addict.\n\nFast forward 7 years through 30+ times in and out of rehabs(many times not completing them), several overdoses, iv coke/meth added in the mix, jail and we get to a year ago where I finally have myself somewhat put together and i start working on getting out of the system but have have to stop consuming cannabis and fall into a deep depression.\n\nI started falling apart quick without the cannabis and was on the verge of suicide. I know it\u2019s not great to be treating by playing doctor with drugs but I\u2019m not ready to be completely sober so I had to do something so I start researching RCs again. I find the current RC cannabinoids on the market aren\u2019t anything I want any parts of so I ordered 1cp-lsd along with some other stuff and it was truly a great decision. That was in March of this year and on my first trip I had so many deep thoughts about my life and the pain I was experiencing and what I needed to do to move forward and made so much progress in that experience that it truly may have stopped me from relapsing on heroin or killing myself because I was in such a bad place. \n\nAt the end of April my biggest fear came to reality and my grandmother, whom helped raise me for years, got Covid and had many pre existing health conditions and passed away. I\u2019m not close with much of my family so the thought of losing any of the few I am haunted me growing up. To the point of I remember being 12 and wanting to join the military at 18 so I could die as what I saw an honorable death at the time and never have to deal with losing anyone. Had this of happened in March in complete sobriety I would have went off the deep end. \n\nAbout two weeks after she passed I took 300ug of 1cp-lsd and watched The Midnight Gospel on Netflix and had one of the most introspective, emotional and therapeutic experiences of my life. Shout out to Duncan Trussell because that night changed my life.\n\nSo things were going somewhat good but with quarantine I started getting bored and got the dumb idea to dive into RC opioids. HUGE MISTAKE. I also got into some RC stims and tryptamines but I made the bad decision of slamming 2-map and o-dsmt. I got to the point where I was doing a lot and for a while and started getting bad WDs. Explored some iV stims too but found it\u2019s a dumb idea. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few weeks not since I threw away the rest of my 2map and used the rest of the o-dsmt after having a moment of clarity that by abusing RCs like I was it was no different than abusing meth/heroin and honestly probably worse and less safe. Used kratom to wein myself off and 3-fpm to help get through work. Can\u2019t say I\u2019ll never slam an RC again but I\u2019m definitely gonna do my damn best not to and not abuse them and I don\u2019t ever wanna get another opioid again. \n\nIdk why I\u2019m writing this, mostly hoping my experience will stop someone from making the same mistake I did and let people know how insidious opioids can be. And hey, I\u2019m not preaching that no one should do them because I\u2019m sure some people can use them responsibly like I can use benzos responsibility and just stop doing them whenever and not redose and blackout. Hell, I\u2019ve had a shit ton of etiz and clam laying around for like 6 months and used it once each and probably am gonna give most away and just keep a few doses of the etiz for an emergency situation. But if opioids/opiates bring you to your knees like they do me, heed my warning and if you\u2019ve never tried them before you\u2019re honestly not missing out on anything and your money is much better spend on things like lysergamides, tryptamines, mushrooms and phenethylamines.

Makes me wish that women wanted to have sex with me.\n\nIt's probably best to keep space between uses of this chemical due to possible serotonin action. I will write a full report after I have more experience.\n\n**3-HO-PCE and 3-HO-PCP:** I tried the PCE first [(report)](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/eldpya/starting_the_morning_with_3hopce/), then the PCP, so now I can offer a brief comparison. I use low to moderate doses, so this might not be applicable to higher doses. Your results may differ, of course.\n\n- 3-HO-PCE seems fairly balanced between stimulating and sedating. 3-HO-PCP is considerably more on the sedating side.\n\n- 3-HO-PCE has a bit of a \"cold\" feeling to it. 3-HO-PCP is \"warm\". 3-HO-PCP has that distinct opioid warmth to it (and mu-opioid affinity), which I have not felt from 3-HO-PCE at all.\n\n- 3-HO-PCE is trippy and not really euphoric, although it is pleasant. 3-HO-PCP is noticeably euphoric on its own, and it's easy to have an enjoyable experience with it.\n\n- The comeup for (oral) 3-HO-PCP is really long!\n\n**NEP:** Vaping NEP makes it really fun to vape more NEP! Not much else. So far, I've found the stimulation to be meh, the euphoria to be okay, and the comedown to be not worth it. Really, the best part of the experience has been vaping it (on foil) - it vaporizes very nicely, and call me weird, but I like the taste.\n\nI will try it oral and insufflated at some point. Edit - Not snorting this stuff again. Irritated the fuck out of my nose at just 20 mg.

A modification of the structure is unlikely to dramatically change the saftey profile. All of the harms of fentanyl can be mitigited with proper saftey procedures. Anyone remeber AH-7921? How about MT-45? These chemicals are so far away from any known opiod that the saftey profile cannot accuratly be predicited. The chemical itself could be toxic or cause seizures. Users of these two substances reported some very concering side effects such as hearing problems and hair loss. As well as dysporia, cauaticisty and hallucinations. Most likely due to kappa antagoism but the binding profile remains complely unknown. Now we have 2map and ap-238 which are an improvment on mt-45 for sure and they have seen clinical use. But for anyone who is tolerant / dependant these chems are of little use. The dose required is in the 100s of miligrams and for the price its just not economical. They serve ok for the opiod naive but even then O-DSMT is far superior. Its saftey profile is well established and potency is on par with morphine. I know that it is likely going to be gone from the market soon and 2map and friends are a reasonable replacement for the opiod naive market. Its unfouratant that the options are either insanly potent such as fentanyl and the nitazene compounds. Despite the extreme potency these compounds lack the euphoria that heroin, oxy, and others have. The short duration and heavy sedation are undesiriable as well. Then on the other side we have compounds like 2map, ap238 and odsmt that are generally good compounds for the opiod naive. They are essentially useless for the fentalog consumers and fentalogs are far too risky for the naive. So until the market gives us a compound that works for both of these groups eg oxycodone fentalouges and etonitaze based compounds will continue to be the best option for depentant users.

I can\u2019t imagine it being any worse than at worst a couple nights without sleep, maybe two weeks sleeping  less than 6 hours broken sleep, a week of sweating, feeling cold, maybe some shaking, teeth chattering, feeling restless and kicking legs, loosing a little weight, and  fatigue, anxiety, gloominess, possibly anger. In wouldn\u2019t suggest any benzos at all but I won\u2019t discount what you might be experiencing so I\u2019m trying to word this sensitively; you are determined it be necessary to manage your symptoms try to consider my second and third paragraph but if Kratom withdrawal is something that is sufferable to you then benzo addiction I see extremely likely and withdrawal being truly impossible. You will not notice any symptoms from the Kratom withdrawal on clam, that\u2019s for sure but I\u2019d bet you\u2019ll be noticing dropping the clam from there.\n\nI just hope to reduce the risk/harm,I am being straightforward not using scare tactics.

Two im particular  One of which was a TROPANE alkaloid, of all things, called Azaprocin. Approximately ten times the potency of Morphine (so on par with intravenous Oxymorphone, and Desomorphine, AKA the infamous \"Krokodil\") with a short duration and an ultrarapid onset, never been marketed. It has a structure that is unlike any other, though Bucinnazine (aka AP-237) could be considered a loose, distant analog of Azaprocin in a similar manner that Dimethocaine (DMC) and Nitracaine are related to Cocaine. \n\nThis is an intriguing compound, but there's another one that caught my eye big time. Called Dimethylaminopivalophenone, and for the sake of discussion, I will shorten to DMAP. It's structure is very unusual, truly unlike any other opioid. It reminds me of a horribly mutated cathinone, specifically Buproprion, and yet it's an opioid. Though this is just speculation, it may have some stimulating effects similar to Tramadol, and might have a fairly long duration. But the simplicity of this chem, it's not a complex structure like Butorphanol or Buprenorphine. And the fact there's no other opioid related to it? Means it's likely to not be covered by Analog Act laws. Overall It looks very promising, though of course I'd be worried about seizures and possibly serotonin syndrome if the affinity was high enough to matter (ki= <1000nM). Very little is known about these two, and obviously the additional risks they pose is unknown until someone is brave enough to bioassay them. But due to both drugs not being stupidly potent like fentalogs that'll just kill you dead even with liquid volumetric measurement, but still being reasonably potent, the easy structure and synthesis of DMAP, the high potency of Azaprocin, and the fact both are unlikely to fall under the analog act? I think we might have a winner here. I'd love to hear you guy's thoughts. Are these two opioids something you'd actually be interested in trying? Or do you think these becoming RCs is a pipe dream?

For reference cocaine has a LD50 of 96mg/kg oral in mice. Though there's no telling if that's including fatal respiratory depression, or SERT/NET affinity causing seizures or hyperthermia or anything of that nature, but in theory that means a fatal dose in humans should be about 350-400mg (83mg \u00f7 12.3 (mouse to human correction factor,  body surface area x 60kg human= 404.8mg).

I've learned a ton about  pharmacology and structure activity relationship and such, but interpreting chemical structures still gets me sometimes. It seemed to me like the tropane had been been replaced with a piperazine, and the butyryl chain has stayed on the nitrogen group. I know tropanes, piperidine and piperazines are all very close and several drugs are \"hybrids\" between the three, such as Methylphenidate and HDMP-28, as well as Dimethocaine being distantly related to cocaine. If memory serves one of the earliest synthetic anticholinergics was based of the tropane/piperidine structure, they wanted the drug to act similar to Scopolamine so they used it as a starting point. It might be Diphenhydramine but don't quote me on that. Still, I appreciate the correction. \n\nAs for DMAP? It's hard to say. It reminds me of Buproprion, except after I did some digging? Pivalophenone=2,2-dimethylpropiophenone. So they're both 2-Phenylpropanoids, but on DMAP, the amino (NH2) group is replaced by a dimethyl group, and on the third chain, instead of the N-Tert-Butylamino group (the strange vertical cross across the molecule), it's a dimethylamino.

Scales have drastically come down in price and gotten better quality in the last 10 years. There is also huge number of different models to choose from now. Scales can be had as low as under $5. Great ones for bit over $10. Good milligram scale for bit over $20.\n\nI like ordering stuff from eBay. It's fun to test out things. In the last 10 years my apartment has been searched countless times by police always resulting in the loss of my scales. I have given away all my scales when I have tried to stop using drugs. I have borrowed scales to a friends in need who never returned it. Or just given away for various reasons.\n\nI have experience of many different scales from varying price brackets. Here are my recommendations. I have nothing to gain from this. Just sharing my experiences to help others.\n\nIn my opinion it's mandatory for everyone to own two scales. You need a quality 0.01g and 0.001g accuracy scales. Scale with 0.1g accuracy is absolutely useless. Never buy such a scale. Price difference to 0.01g scale is not significant. \n\nPeople often recommend the Gemini 20 scale. I think that's a carry over from 10+ years ago when there were no other options. I have owned few and it's no a good scale. No wonder people who own them think small amounts can't be measured even with a milligram scale. \n\n[NEWACALOX 0.001g / 100g. \u00a320 shipped](https://www.ebay.com/itm/NEWACALOX-100-50G-0-001G-Digital-LCD-Jewellery-Weight-Pocket-Scale-USB-Powered/283492700904)\nMilligram scale with 100g max limit. That's a rare sight. Built in battery that is charged with micro-usb. Mine has been on very heavy use for months still going with the first charge. Previous scales that I have owned start to give inaccurate results as batteries run low and the worst thing is when there are no replacement batteries available. This scale is also very accurate when calibrated correctly. I trust the scale accurately measure 10mg doses. But this requires good technique and several measurements to be sure. Under 10mg is still volumetric territory.\n\n[NEWACALOX 0.01g / 500g. \u00a310 shipped](https://www.ebay.com/itm/NEWACALOX-500g-x-0-01g-Electronic-Jewelry-Scale-USB-Powered-Digital-LCD-Display/283511893121)\nSmaller brother of the previous scale with 0.01g accuracy and 500g limit.

For nearly a decade now, actually. Somewhat recently, my dose became much higher than I was comfortable with and began searching for other options. \n\n\nI learned about opioid RCs a bit too late apparently, since the ideal compound for me was apparently gone (isotonitazene). The next best thing was etazene, at 25x the potency of morphine. It\u2019s an analogue of etonitazene, which has urban legends surrounding it and horror stories of its own.\n\n\nAnyway, my fentanyl use had exceeded 30mg a day at the point of my acquisition of etazene, which was just unacceptable due to the ups and downs it caused. I began dosing etazene, by itself first thing in the morning, beginning with 50-75mg to start. \n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t quite enough, so I upped my dosage to 100-150mg, and found this to be quite acceptable. The euphoria is absolutely there, challenging any opiate/opioid I\u2019ve ever tried honestly. Pain relief is wonderful as well, and general sense of motivation+well-being as well. Not like the euphoria I get from fentanyl at all, really (and yes, I DO get euphoria from fentanyl).\n\n\nOver the last two months or so, I\u2019ve managed to drop my fentanyl dosage to 10mg per day, and have kept my etazene usage about the same as initially. I\u2019m not trying to quit anything right now, my life is actually pretty great to be honest, I don\u2019t have anything to complain about aside from my dependencies. \n\n\nAll in all, I\u2019ve found etazene to be a great substance for my needs. No weird side effects noted, and I\u2019ve been using daily for ~2-3 months now. It\u2019s been a wonderful addition to my \u201cprogram\u201d and has aided in doing something I didn\u2019t think possible. \n\n\nI must stress that my doses are NOT typical, and should not be taken by anybody that isn\u2019t already at my level of tolerance/dependence.

We ordered from the Netherlands.\n\n## Background\nO-AMKD, also known as O-acetylmethylketobemidone, or acetoxymethylketobemidone, is apparently a prodrug to methylketobemidone, an analog of ketobemidone.\n\nKetobemidone is an opioid analgesic used mostly in Scandinavian countries, with an effectivity similar to morphine but reportedly more euphoric at similarly analgesic doses.\n\nIt has certain NMDA antagonist activity due to one of its main metabolites (norketobemidone, results from N-demethylation), which its methyl analogue may or may not share.\n\n## Physical features\nIt was a fine white powder, odorless. Moderately painful to the nasal passages. When it started going down our throats later on, we could feel a caustic taste vaguely reminiscent of cocaine.\n\nAt the end of the experience, we agreed that the substance probably contained some stimulant (presumably caffeine). Possibly to make it safer or something, we didn't like it but I must say it made it easier to be active. Maybe it's simply not as sedating as other opioids.\n\n## Dosage\nWe didn't know what the exact active dose was. My friends took about 0.8-0.9 mg/kg each, while I only took 0.4-0.6 mg/kg because I had responsibilities later that day.\n\nAll the doses were insufflated. We didn't redose, but later into the effects we smoked some weed. My friends took 2 lorazepam pills each (to ease some anxiety). I took an antihistamine at the beginning to prevent nausea (can't remember the exact drug, sorry).\n\nWe all reported that the doses were pretty low (better lean to the safe side with a new chemical).\n\n## Timeline\n - The effects took about 10 minutes to become noticeable.\n - We were coming up for about 30-50 minutes. Smoked weed near the end of this. About 3-4 hits each.\n - Peaking for about an hour. We went home and laid comfortably watching TV.\n - Came down really slowly, at least 1.5 hours for me, maybe 2 or 3 for my friends.\n - Afterwards I still felt comfortably sleepy for like 2-4 hours, and I went to sleep.\n\n## Effects\nI really loved this substance. We were all a little anxious due to not knowing how high our doses actually were. For me, the anxiety was gone pretty early, as I felt the euphoria kicking in. One of my friends felt great only when the weed wore off (doesn't like weed, was not as bad as other times tho), but reported a good experience overall. The other friend didn't like the experience at all.\n\nThere was an analgesic effect, mostly during the peak, but I'd say the euphoria was even more noticeable beyond pain suppression. The physical euphoria was really good, it reminded me of U-47700. A pleasant warmth all over my body. The dose was pretty low though, so I can't say it with confidence.\n\nThe psychological euphoria didn't disappoint me the least bit. I remember being out in the cold, showered with heavy rain, a train passing nearby with horrible noise, and I didn't care. It was also pretty anxiolytic, at least for me.\n\nEdit: I also remember laughing like a retard watching a film that wasn't actually that funny. I was the only one laughing like that, probably due to the weed, that I deeply love. I was for sure the one feeling the most euphoria.\n\nReally strong pupil constriction, even at my dose, but no heavy constipation with me. We could also walk normally without feeling nauseous. One of my friends experienced itches that they described as pleasant. I got them to a lesser degree.\n\nAs I said before, I had responsibilities later that day. Those fell into the after-effects/late comedown phase, and I could attend them normally. I was slightly more motivated owing to the euphoria, but also really sleepy, so I ended up being less efficient. Remember that it was a low dose.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention time dilation. Time passed way slower on this. Everything looked darker and duller too.\n\n## Hangover\nJoint pain, irritability and the like. Pretty hard to study or do anything productive. I expected all of it. Also, urinating right after the end of the experience was slightly painful, but there was no kidney pain, so I didn't worry.\n\n## Overall impression\nOf the opioids I have tried, this is probably my favorite, along with maybe U-47700. My friend (does a lot of drugs too) also liked it and is looking forward to buying more of it.

I'm going to provide links to the monographs below for you all to view. You can also find my growing  monograph collection (based on my 15 years of experience in the clandestine chemistry field) via my username: [u/DuchessVonD](https://www.reddit.com/u/DuchessVonD/)\n\nEven for the non-chemist on this sub, it will give many of you an idea of what goes on during the process of selecting analogues to pursue in the Research Chemical field and a bit about the bizarre off-color and off-the-cuff ideas that go through the head of a research chemist by day, clandestine chemist by night. For those who lack a sense of humor and lack sarcasm and appreciation for flippant sarcastic banter, you may not enjoy my monographs that much. They are far from cut and dry musings of experimental procedure and strictly lab-based chemistry. There is a lot of social commentary, history, literature review, pharmacology, as well as a phat bong rip of chemistry. I must admit that most of the stuff that goes through my head during my free time has little to do with chemistry, sometimes it gets a little \"colorful\" especially for a little Jewish Jersey girl like me. \\[check out my **Poetry-Dope Rhymes** section below for more details\\]\n\nThere's  something for everyone \\[interested in opioid research chemicals that is, but I will hit upon methaqualone analogues as well as benzodiazepines and have a discussion on 4-methylaminorex in my monographs\\]. Or there will be in the coming weeks and months as I have time to summarize my decade and a half long work in this arena and format these notes/commentary into my trademark-style of monographs. I try to focus on the unusual **Opioid X-Files**: mostly legal  analogues, consisting of the good, the bad, and the ugly of the lesser  known alleyways of the opioid class. Some are legitimately wonderful and euphoric. Most notable of these uniquely Duchess explorations is the revival of two old school Janssen opioids:\n\n(a) the ethyl ketone of despropionyl-beztramide (**Etodezitramide**)\n\n(b) And the highly euphoric N,N-Dimethyl analogue of dextromoramide/racemoramide known as **Dimethylmoramide.**\n\nIn my latest monograph addition I describe my experience synthesizing and commentary on the pharmacology of **phenomorphone** (N-phenethylnormoxymorphone), which is synthesized through a variety of reverse engineering N-demethylation procedures for oxymorphone, which I have dubbed ***Duchess von D-allylation***, *N-deallylation of naloxone into noroxymorphone which undergoes N-alkylation into phenomorphone*, which has a euphoric potency (not equivalent to a toxicity or analgesic potency) of fentanyl, but with more euphoric properties and an all-together different (in my opinion better) high than that of fentanyl, methadone or even heroin. Nonetheless, I find its high to be uniquely enriching and the buzz altogether wonderful.\n\nOther analogues that were less successful are still discussed and mentioned, I consider these my deformed back-alley abortion brain babies. I tend to  write without a filter, so you'll have to put up w/ a blend of my  mental abortions, usually of the coat-hanger variety: esp. *my highly  politically incorrect discourse* (which peppers my monographs throughout).

Microwaves do  serve other important purposes during the process, such as isolation  and purification steps (and for making \"Mack\" methadone free base crack  and \"Frack\" fentanyl free base crack) as well as the processing of the  intermediates.\n\nMicrowave etonitazene (***nukenitazene***)  was redeeming for its rapid access to the etonitazene molecule as well  as its utility for obtaining other analogues of the benzimidazole  scaffold. Etonitazene through conventional means \\[FI Carrol and  Coleman's 1975 EEDQ mediated synthesis\\] required a total of *9 days of reflux*.  As with the methadone nitrile synth, the scale-limitations put a  ceiling on its practicality, limiting batches to < 25 grams.\n\nUsing  a time-pulsed temp regulator (these are different from variacs)  combined with a MW that has an internal % power setting, the *clandestinist* can achieve ***Manifest Microwave Destiny***  and calibrate a consumer grade MW oven for use as an ideal laboratory  aid w/o physical modification of the microwave proper. The power output  can be estimated by taking the value provided by the manufacturer (i.e.  1000 W microwave oven) and then multiplying that by the % power setting  built-into the MW oven user interface. The best solution for the  homebake MW chemistry were the 10% and 20% settings on a 1000W MW oven.  This helps the clandestinist estimate the power range of their adapted  oven and compare it to lab-grade MW reactors and their associated  reaction wattage (which are specified in the literature).\n\nStirring  in the MW oven can also be tricky. It is best achieved by either  limiting your rxn scale so that stirring is unnecessary, or finding the  biggest baddest magnetic stirrer out there, disassembling the top  ceramic surface, and substituting the existing magnets with super  strength neodymium rare earth magnets. Those bad boys will whip that  solution like *Marquis de Sade in a Bangkok brothel.* The setup will have no problem with the *MW-stirrer double team*: churning up magnetic *cream*, while you *ream* it with a microwave *beam*.\n\nMost  of the \"magical MW effect\" mumbo jumbo (termed the non-thermal MW  effect) in the chemical literature is misleading. Most of the so-called  MW effect on rxn thermodynamics and kinetics is due to the increased  pressure resulting from conducting in a sealed vessel and the rapid  heating achieved as a result of using pressure vessels. Conducting a  reaction under pressure outside of the MW using a conventional heat  source will probably achieve the same effect, although usually quite a  bit slower. There is a Microwave Scale Disadvantage though, which is  readily apparent in the opioid syntheses that I adapted for home MW oven  use. The lack of MW interaction w/ many nonpolar organic solvents  limits the versatility. If something has the the polarity of benzene or  one of the n-hexane/pet ether solvents, you are going to have problems  getting that rxn working in the MW.  But high polarity solvents such as  water, DMF, alcohols, acetonitrile and ethers/esters/ketones, those work  splendidly...sometimes too well as their rapid heat and resulting  pressure can shatter containers.

Of course, I could have never made it the medical field, b/c I enjoy fucking off and getting blasted in my free time, which, if I were (lets say) an anesthesiologist, \"free time\" would correspond to anytime the patient was unconscious...here are some scenarios:\n\n\"Hey bitch,\" I'd say to the nurse, \"Hold down the fort, i mean, the ether mask for a minute while mommy does a rail of clonazolam off the washboard abs of the surgical tech.\"\n\n\"Hey doc,\" says the patient, \"I think you forget something when you sewd me up.\"\n\nMe: \"Oh, yeah, you're right.

This bitch wears the pants in the relationship (I mean, metaphorically speaking, b/c obviously, they're not on right now and, btw, you can stop handhandling my ass, b/c we both know you finished with the exam long ago, and while, if i were anybody else, i'd take it as a complement that a creepy man in a lab coat is fondling my rear, you and I know its not going to make the cover of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition anytime soon, so stop), so if anyone's giving the spanking it's gonna be me.\") \n\nLater on, after I had woken up from my benzo mediated stupor, and found myself hooked up to an IV bag full of what looked like milky white syrup, which looked suspiciously like vancomycin (my father, a GI specialist had informed me of all the bad shit, like antibiotic resistant C. Diff and the like you can get from overusing powerful antibiotics such as vancomycin, which I, of course, in my OCD-like manner, misinterpreted as vancomycin = terrible persistent AB-resistant infections), so I begin removing my IV line when this black female physician (I think she was Haitian) walked in while on rounds (w/ a gaggle of students) in the middle of me freaking out. I told that bitch:\n\"Listen here you stupid Caribbean cunt, I will get fucking Hallakah Krav-Maga KKK Karate on yo' ass quicker than you can light a fucking cross on fire in your own front yard if you don't remove this shit from my arm, apologize, and tell your students over there, 'I'm a dumb bitch who uses Vancomycin too soon, Please excuse me, I'm just a simple Caribbean coon.'\" (I had kind of thought about what I was going to say ahead of time, as I was fumbling w/ my IV line and getting frustrated with how securely they had ported it in) Despite my minute stature, when I'm freaking out, I can give lucifer a run for his money and win an ice dagger staring match with Charlie Manson. Of course, the KKK would be equally liable to leave a burning cross (or would it be a burning menorah?) in my front yard, but the Doctor didn't know that.

You MUST stop taking Subutex for at least 24-36 hours before proceeding with everything I wrote here below.\n\nIf you are taking fenta analogues, vaping is the 2.nd most safe RoA you can use.The safest is to smoke on glass pipe, but if you have pure compounds, you need to have Mannitol and a very precise scale or analytical scale.\n\nFu-F is approx 25x morphine potency. Depending your tolerance, and seen your Subu Barrier, it's not that you are new to Opiates and I don't think you are stupid to overdose.\n\nFu-F vaporized requires a pretty higher dosage than smoked, snorted or oral/IV, that is normally for people with low tolerance 0.5-1mg.\n\nThis dosage suggestion is based on Intel that I got from the seller providing Fu-F E-Liquid that was sold for long in 2018 on DNM, was dosed 400mg/10ML, and considered \"safe\" for the beginners. All depends how many puffs you take, how long you keep the smoke, and many other variables.\n\nI have made myself Vape Liquid but using FFF and not Fu-F. FFF is stronger than Fu-F, approx 35x morphine potency. 400mg/10ML of FFF was a pretty strong dosage, even with only 3-4 Puffs.\n\nTherefore if you are not absolutely sure that what you get is Fu-F, and could be another analogue, then d**on't do stupid things** and start with a lower dosage of 100-200mg/10ML. **And before this, either LAB TEST what you got or proceed VERY SAFE doing an allergy test, then by volumetric dosage prepare a spray and start with the absolute minimum of 10-20ug**. I know it's a pain and it takes many days to find the threshold, but better waste some days that be dead.\n\nBy preparing your E-liquid you must be ABSOLUTELY sure the compound is TOTALLY dissolved and the E-Liquid is crystal clear and homogeneous.\n\nYou can achieve this by taking a normal E-Liquid with the flavor you prefer, and after you verified what you got is 100% Fu-F, then put 300-400mg in 10ML and mix/shake it very well. This will NOT be enough to have an homogeneous solution: you need to wait 12 hours and shake/mix again, or you can GENTLE warm the liquid, put in a glass vials, and keep mixing in the meantime.\n\nBe very careful to not heat too much, or you will break the molecules making it less effective. If you do it properly, after you do this process to warm/heat 2-3 times and keep mixing, the E-Liquid should become again completely transparent.\n\nBefore usage, make sure the liquid is still totally homogeneous and proceed taking small puffs without keeping the smoke too long in your lungs.\n\nBe safe.", "replies": {"f61omf5": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/dphfmz/fuf_ejuice_help/f61omf5/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1572672325.0, "body": "Thanks for the heads up and VERY RELEVANT and HELPFUL information/advice...

Another free radical produced in metabolism is NO which further increases oxidative stress. Ammonia is also metabolized when meth is administered which is neurotoxic. This doesn\u2019t bring into account the excitotoxicity caused by the release of glutamate (not norepinephrine) due to the mechanism of how glutamate receptors work (which is by allowing positive ions, mostly Ca2+ in this case, to enter the cell and create higher chance of firing, when this is prolonged it stresses the cell and can damage it quite fast). These drugs also cause mitochondrial damage through high energy consumption and cause apoptosis (cell death) to occur in some regions of the brain. And yes, MDMA causing a temperature increase does increase neurotoxicity, but it is not why MDMA is neurotoxic.

A quick search here on Reddit will render hundreds of posts discouraging use and telling tales of the horrid withdrawal but after reading so much about it I had to try it out for myself and to be completely honest I am pretty amazed. \n\nDOSE: 150mg of Tianeptine sodium Orally, dissolved in water (no opioid tolerance) \n\nNOTE: Tianeptine tastes horrendous, possibly the most bitter thing I have ever consumed \n\n\\--REPORT--\n\n0:10 - Feel a slight relaxation hitting me, placebo? Not sure at this point.\n\n0:15 - Suddenly feel a strong opioid effect coming over me, I'm begging to zone out looking at my screen and a strong sensation of warmth is spreading from head to toe.\n\n0:30 - Wow the rush was incredible, I have gone from completely sober to extremely high within the span of only about 20 minutes, I feel a strong \"stoned\" sensation in my head and have all of the classic opioid effects that one would expect from a strong opiate narcotic like oxycodone or hydrocodone (If not even stronger looking back). However the sedation aspect isn't quite there, I do feel spaced out and heavy-eyed, however I have been unable to catch a nod thus far.\n\n1:00 - After my previous entry I got in bed for the next half hour. Although still feel extremely \"opiate high\" and have now nodded off a few times the Euphoria is begging to fade. \n\n1:30 - Effects are still very strong and subtle itching is begging to set in. Although I feel incredibly sedated and disconnected from my body I haven't been able to nod as much as I normally would off other classic opiates. My body almost feels as if its sinking into my bed, really nice actually.\n\n2:00 - I'm begging to return to baseline. Although I still feel some pretty decent opioid effects I'm definitely past the peak and am actually starting to nod a little harder then before, possibly because the other non-opioid aspects of the drug are wearing off? The euphoria is pretty much gone however yet physically, I still feel amazing. \n\n3:30 - The effects are almost gone now. I still have a lingering opioid sensation through out my body but I am no longer nodding and mentally I feel very tired and still slightly spacey but almost baseline other then that.\n\n5:00 Effects are totally gone, although I barely still feel a slight comfort through out my body, mentally I am completely sober and ready to go to sleep.\n\nConclusion: \n\nWow for a legal RC this is amazing. Its by far the best legal opioid I have ever tried and kicks kratom's ass if you want a classic full agonist high. Its definitely not as \"clean\" feeling as morphine/fentanyl derived opiates but its damn close. For me It felt like a mix between tramadol and oxycodone, leaning far more towards oxy if not being even stronger in some aspects. Although the peak and overall duration is short It has an incredible rush and feels no different then a strong narcotic I would expect to be given by a doctor. \n\nHowever despite my praise this drug is not all good, as I'm sure many of you know it has awful withdrawals and due to its short duration is incredibly fiendish. This is mostly because although the bodily opiate effects linger about as long as oxycodone the euphoria fades rapidly within less then 2 hours and possibly shorter as tolerance builds. \n\nIn conclusion tianeptine sodium provides a slightly dirtier and shorter but arguably stronger oxycodone like high. It feels no different from a classic opioid and I believe the potential for abuse is no less. If you can see yourself having problems with opiate use or have been dependent in the past stay far away from this drug because although the high is good it will smash all classic opioids in terms of withdrawal and tolerance.

Since it's a tricyclic anti depressant it works on multiple systems, only one of which is the mu opioid receptors. Normal prescribed doses are 12.5 mg 3x daily, so recreational doses are roughly 10 times a singular dose. The issue with that is that a lot of the other mechanisms (serotonin reuptake enhancement, glutamatergic system downregulation) do not scale in the same way as the opioid effects.\n\nThis means that to get the desired opioid effects, people have to take massive doses that end up raising tolerance/activating other pathways really quickly and aggressively. This means that while normal withdrawal from opiates can be uncomfortable, withdrawal from tianeptine is like withdrawing from an opiate, an antidepressant, and a benzodiazepine/tranquilizer all at the same time, and after a shorter period of use than a typical opioid. It would be especially strong because of the doses being 10x+ the therapeutic effect as well, meaning someone unlucky enough to kick a tianeptine habit will be in for:\n\nrunny nose, achy bones, no energy, hot/cold flashes, stomach cramps/explosive diarrhea, increased pain sensitivity, extreme restless leg syndrome, extreme feelings of sadness/depression/hopelessness, akathisia, extreme anxiety.\n\nPeople should be able to choose what they do/put in their bodies, as long as it doesn't harm others. Drug education/awareness and freedom are extremely important and hopefully attainable in our lifetimes.  That said, this is a very powerful drug intended to be used in small amounts that works on a lot of systems in a not very targeted way. Consider this: if you enjoy it, will you not want to do it more? If that is the case, those withdrawals are a very probable future outcome.

Generally nootropics are supposed to be cognitive/life enhancing without being in the same category as drugs that get you \"high\" (which is why phenibut has a lot of warnings around it on nootropics posts currently).\n\nIt's a weird situation because there are no firm categorizations, it ends up coming down to perception. Things that are perceived as cognitive enhancing/making people more productive/healthier/happier/not associated with typical drug abuse behaviors = nootropic, anything where the verbage/associations change to be more like traditional drugs the community tends to shun. \n\nFor that reason people are generally more accepting of the Sulfate form of Tianeptine as a nootropic because it has a very long duration of action, very little peak, maintains a lot of the mood lifting/cognition enhancing/anxiolytic effects without more extreme euphoria, and doesn't facilitate compulsive redosing.", "replies": {"g4i039y": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/iomc05/tianeptine_review_and_experience_report_sodium/g4i039y/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1599640986.0, "body": "Thanks for that info and clarify that!
