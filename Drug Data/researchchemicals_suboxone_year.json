The levels however will not tell them what they need to know in terms of dosing and most hospitals will not be familiar with dosing of clonazolam or what urine levels of what metabolites those entail. There's a pretty simple protocol for detoxing people off benzos. You take vitals, you take a patient history, and then just taper them up to a daily dose according to their vitals.

I\u2019ve gone willing a few times and still nothing. I\u2019m told to contact the county and try to get a county bed. \n\nI\u2019ve also called these rehabs every for 30 days to get in so they know I\u2019m serious. However this was while on heroin and unsuccessful because I\u2019m stupid. Going back is even more challenging. I have been to one detox facility while on fetty and they tried giving me subs before the 24 hour mark and I denied it until I was sick and even then was still scared and asked if it would make it worse. They said of course not.. and of course it did.. the answer after that? More suboxone right away. What was a 7 day stay was cut short because I CHOSE to leave on day 5 since I was in the same amount of suboxone from when I began, i was sick and felt depressed from either WD/SUBS/ or being alone in a small hospital room with a tiny tv and no sound. \n\nBottom line, it depends on insurance, location, money and time.

I was super lucky that a family member found me passed out on the bathroom floor, surrounded by feces and not breathing.  I didn't exactly escape that nightmare scenario unscathed as I hit my face on the bathroom sink when I collapsed and the wound became infected with staph.  When it healed, it left a large and noticable permanent dent about the size of a nickel on my face.  That was four years ago, but everyday I look in the mirror and see that blemish on my handsome face and it pisses me off.\n\nYeah bro, fuck recreational use of opioids and even diazepines for that matter.  Nothing good ever came from my abuse of them, especially during my methadone clinic years.  Sure they are great if used medicinally and cautiously, but how often are we as addicts able to maintain such a healthy balance.  \n\nThe RC scene has some great and awesome chems like psychedelics and dissociatives and stimulants and that's good enough for me these days.  I learned that lesson the hard way though, strictly through trial and error, including two involuntarily stays at the psych ward, multiple emergency room visits, and about five acute overdoses.

I also dealt with benzodiazepines w/d CT.\n\nI have a grand fear of withdrawals, I just don't want to go through it again and God knows how many times I could have to deal with that. Suboxone was a lifesaver for me, I was able to hold a job, go back to school. I started at 8 mg and tapered slowly to 2 mg. I even tapered down once to 0.10 mg without too much suffering.\n\nI relapsed and came back on 2 mg. It's true, I am still dependant on a powerful opioid. and you are right, there's not much of a high to buprenorphine. I do get a small kick out of it though, it's subtle but I enjoy it, it gives me a energy and motivation boost.\n\nRight now, I use the extra energy to complete the hardest math class I ever took, Integral Calculus... I failed twice with the magistral courses, with 56% both times. I'm doing it at home this time. I'm almost done actually and after I get my degree, I will taper again the Suboxone. Sub is easy to taper since it doesn't get you high.\n\nMan, some people have spent their whole lifes as slaves... Suboxone is a good master, I am gladly serving him for a few years, to turn my life around, taper slowly with a volumetric solution, and then go travel the world, make my wildest dreams come true. By virtue of patience, you earn your freedom.\n\nIt would just really bother me if you make it through a few weeks of withdrawals, go on with your life for a couple months... and this is the usual scenario for opiates addicts: one day you just get unbearable cravings flaring up in your entrails, and the cravings are so strong that, personally, it makes me loose all reason, I just chased opioids and relapsed more or less slowly.\n\nI self withdraw a couple times by myself, in detox centers, I sojourned in rehabilitation centers, for up to 4 months. I still relapsed and the social worker following me in addiction consulting, told me my last and best option was Suboxone.

Heroin is safer as we know the risks, it's also probably cheaper. I am an addict like you but taking seriously high doses of heroin. I was on 3g a day of pure heroin tartrate, recently started a taper and now down to \\~600mg daily. I would recommend you do something similar, going cold turkey has risks and I wouldn't do that without medical supervision. In my mind your options are as follows:  \n\n\n1. Switch to another full agonist with a more known risk profile (heroin, morphine, methadone etc) and taper on your own until your dose is more manageable and then seek help.\n2. Continue taking U-47700 (or another full agonist) and then use the Bernese method (microdose buprenorphine) to switch to buprenorphine without precipitated WDs. Then seek help if you want to get off the buprenorphine, or follow another taper protocol.\n3. Go to an ibogaine treatment center. I'm thinking of this one myself. I've seen reports of 1g daily heroin users taking a flood dose of ibogaine and getting minimal to no WDs. If you really want to get clean ASAP, then it seems this is the route to go.\n4. Go to your doctor or a traditional addiction clinic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA combination of these options might be necessary. Depending on the characteristics of your addiction and your personal circumstances, home tapering might be futile. Only you will know. One thing I feel confident saying is that heroin is healthier than U-47700.  Also kratom or O-desmethyltramadol (ODSMT) might be an option once you get your dose down, I am considering these also as stepping stones to coming off completely. O-DSMT is the active metabolite of tramadol so it's 'safe' in that it has solid research and tox studies behind it. Kratom is also well researched.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck and don't kill yourself!", "replies": {"fet1uap": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/eqd6v7/im_currently_slamming_about_1_gram_or_more_a_day/fet1uap/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1579399817.0, "body": "I appreciate the feedback brother! I can tell you that I\u2019ve gotten clean off of u-47700 before and thats part of the reason why I switched to it.

I can also say that I\u2019ve tried the ibogaine treatment in Mexico and used right when I got back. I told them it didn\u2019t work. I mean I felt better but not by much. Still had intense cravings. The best part about it was the 5 meo DMT. However maybe I just wasn\u2019t ready at that point. I wish I stayed clean after it would have altered my life tremendously. But I went for my gf and family more so then myself. \n\nI also did try going to a detox center a few months ago and can say that it was horrible. It\u2019s more depressing then being at home. It was like jail and they gave me subs after I waited until I was sick and same shit happened, precipitated WD. I eventually said Fuck this and bounced on day 4. I have lots of kratom, a few bars and weed saved for when it happens. It needs to!! \n\nI\u2019m going to look into the method you mentioned and see how that works. I\u2019m deathly afraid of taking any subs now. It\u2019s worse WD then ever before and just doing it cold turkey. I felt like I was going to die. Just the thought of it scares me. \n\nBut congrats on switching and tapering ! I hope you eventually get thru the WD and get clean my man. All I know is if you\u2019re determined and want it you can get it. Then maintain it by saving ur ass and hitting some meetings or what ever works for u. \n\nPersonally, I find that I can go 24 hours without it and feel fine. I read others say they need it more often. However if I use once I find that I immediately start craving more immensely. I end up doing more unless it\u2019s at night after a long day.. but even when using once a day my tolerance stayed the same.. idk if it\u2019s me or I\u2019m getting weaker shit.

This is how I have been most successful:\n\nThe key is to taper down. You really don't want to cold turkey this one. You are taking a really heavy dose of a powerful drug. The safest way would be to get into rehab. If that isn't an option, then you need to taper down slowly.\n\nIf you are doing 1g a day, then starting tomorrow, take a maximum of .9g. Do not exceed the daily limit.  From now on, you are only taking it to stay well, not to get high. You will not be able to quit if you keep getting high with it.\n\nAfter a week of .9g, then do a week with a max of .8g.  etc. If you can comfortably use less than the max in any given day, then do so. It will make the whole process go quicker. But never take more.\n\nTry to lower your dosage by .1g weekly. If you can do that, then you should be able to get yourself clean in a few months. The slower you taper, the less painful it will be. It will get more difficult once you get down to .2g and less.  If you need to lower by less than .1/week, then do so. As long as you are always trending down, you are doing it right.\n\nPlan on having some diarrhea and restless legs.  Hot/cold flashes are pretty common as well.  If you can get kratom, start using that, as little as you can.  Just a few grams a day will make your symptoms MUCH less dramatic.  Don't swap one addiction for another... be careful that you don't take large doses which would be counter productive. Again, you are just trying to stay well not get high.\n\nOnce you start getting toward the end of the taper, you can start treating the symptoms with OTC drugs.  If the diarrhea gets bad, take a small amount of Imodium. This is a weak opioid, so it will give you some symptom relief beyond the bowel part, but seriously, you don't want to take more than a few pills a day, and you don't want to take it every day or you can really fuck up your digestive system permanently.\n\nIf you get headaches, try aspirin. If you have access to GABA-ergic drugs, they can be very helpful. Things like gabapentin or Lyrica can help with the restless legs and muscular pain.  Tums or Dramamine can help if your stomach hurts or you get nauseous.  A SMALL amount of benzos can help you get to sleep (but be really careful as you can get far worse WDs from benzos than you do from opioids). Muscle relaxers will help you as well.\n\nStay well hydrated, especially if you have diarrhea. You won't feel like eating much, but make a point to eat something every day, even if it is just buttered noodles or something light. Your body needs food to heal. Eat whatever you can keep down.\n\nAt some point in the process, you'll need to stop injecting the stuff. It is really horrible to inject u-4 to begin with, so try using any other ROA you can. Personally, I always made nasal spray bottles with it and that way it cuts the causticity a bit and makes it do far less damage to your nose. It is also a lot easier to monitor your exact dosages. I found it helpful to keep a \"drug log\" where I would put in exactly how much of which drug I take. Mark each dose.  This way, you can see how much you are taking, and monitor any trends.  It is hard to remember how many squirts I have done today, so I started marking each dose with the number of sprays and dosage. It also makes it easier to count up your doses to make sure you don't go over the daily limit.", "replies": {"fexlhkl": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/eqd6v7/im_currently_slamming_about_1_gram_or_more_a_day/fexlhkl/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1579461739.0, "body": "Thanks for all that advice.

Very unlikely much more likely that you'll die overdosing when you get a shit batch...but anyone reading this if you ever are dealing with someone going through opiate withdrawal just know it can get real real ugly and it's very good to have clonidine on hand for blood pressure problems.\n\n    So yeah technically it's not lethal in the same way severe alcohol wd is....

For those who've never heard of this benzo, Flutazolam is classified as an oxazolobenzodiazepine much like Oxazolam, Cloxazolam, Mexazolam, and Haloxazolam. I managed to purchase 90 pharma grade Coreminal tablets from one of my vendors a long time ago with another Japanese benzo known as Rilmazafone and a few other Japanese pharmaceuticals, the Coreminal tablets contain 4 milligrams of Flutazolam and I've played around with various doses (4, 8, 12, and 16 milligrams) and tonight decided to shoot for 20 milligrams because it's a mild benzo said to be about as strong as Diazepam (Valium) but said to be more hypnotic and produces a more marked sedation and impaired coordination compared to Diazepam and as a result is used as a sleep aid in Japan.\n\n[https://imgur.com/oHNecps](https://imgur.com/oHNecps) \n\n10:30 PM: I take 20 milligrams (5 tablets) of Flutazolam on an empty stomach while watching the newest episode of Better Call Saul.\n\n10:45 PM: I notice it's onset as it has a fairly rapid onset of 10 to 15 minutes much like Alprazolam especially on an empty stomach of course.\n\n11:00 PM: I feel alot more relaxed now than I have all day because I've been stressing out about how my car won't start and worrying if i'm going to have to purchase a new part or two because my car is a piece of shit and not having the money to do so. So far it feels alot like Diazepam (Valium) or Lorazepam (Ativan) and in my trials with Flutazolam I personally don't find it hypnotic at all, in fact I find it be quite anxiolytic with nice muscle relaxing effects. Sleep could possibly come easier if I were to lie down and try to go to sleep but i'm definitely not fighting to stay awake and in my previous trials I should also note this benzo is a short lasting one that lasts 3 to 4 hours at the most.  \n\n11:35 PM: I play the song Escape From LA off The Weeknd's most recent album. The effects seemed to have reached their peak and i'm just chilling on the couch relaxing with my clingy cat rubbing up against me. \n\n12:15 AM: I'm kind of watching Dispatches From Elsewhere (I saw half of the episode before taking the Flutazolam and now I\u2019m watching the first half of the episode. Side note, this show would be interesting to watch on psychedelics, dissociatives, possibly even anticholinergic deliriants like Trihexyphenidyl, and Zolpedim/Ambien because of how trippy the plot is.) and about to eat some leftover pancakes because i'm hungry. The effects are still going strong and i'm starting to get tired and i'm debating on whether or not to try and get some sleep to see how effective of a sleep aid Coreminal is because so far I've stayed awake during my other trials with it, decisions... decisions... \ud83e\udd14\n\n12:45 AM: Well after eating i'm over the 2 hour mark since I took the Flutazolam so the effects are likely going to start dying down soon, still debating on whether or not to go to sleep or stay up and watch Criminal Minds. \ud83e\udd14\n\n1:40 AM: The effects have seemed to have diminished some, this benzo is said to have a 3.5 hour elimination half life so that could possibly explain why it doesn't last very long compared to other benzos. I'm feeling pretty tired and my muscles still feel fairly relaxed although my fibromyalgia is starting to flair up... -.-\n\n2:00 AM: Decide to go to sleep. It took a bit but not terribly long to fall asleep since I was laying on the pressure points in my back where my fibro pain was coming from.\n\n10:00 AM: I wake up feeling stiff and sore from my fibromyalgia flair up and start my morning meds of 150 milligrams of Pregabalin/Lyrica (I take 300 milligrams of Pregabalin a day for my fibromyalgia) and 8 milligrams of Suboxone (I also take 16 milligrams of Suboxone a day). I also decide to smoke a couple bowls of Cannabis and take my final .25 milligram Clonazolam dose. However I feel no next day sedation or grogginess and I think it's safe to say the Flutazolam has worn off. \n\nI may try Flutazolam in a combination of other drugs like the Japanese Methaqualone analogue Afloqualone (Arofuto) which is used as a muscle relaxer in Japan and South Korea or perhaps with Baclofen or other potential fun sedatives. During one of my trials with Flutazolam I drank 5 mixed drinks/cocktails of E&amp;J Apple Brandy and apple juice (a fire mixed drink imo that I highly recommend for any of you who enjoy drinking), 12 milligrams of Flutazolam (Coreminal), and 1050 milligrams of Carisoprodol (Soma) and that was a pretty nice combination with intense muscle relaxation and was extremely anxiolytic and just a great combination all around imo.\n\nI personally think people who have no benzo tolerance or enjoy mild subtle benzos would definitely enjoy this one. Thanks for reading guys. I'm likely going to try and write more trip reports on some of the obscure RCs and foreign pharmaceuticals I have in my possession such as Clomethiazole, Chlorobutanol, Chloral Hydrate, Afloqualone, and Rilmazafone to name a few and combinations of other drugs (particularly Zolpidem/Ambien and Biperiden/Akineton) because it's something to do during this COVID-19 quarantine in the USA.\n\nEdit; I\u2019ve tried another combo with Flutazolam and that was 20 milligrams of Flutazolam and 500 milligrams of \nF-Phenibut both taken on an empty stomach and it was a decent combo with good anxiolytic effects although I feel like I were to lay down and try that combination could have potentially helped me fall asleep or take a nap. The combo lasted 4 to 5 hours definitely not a bad combo. I may have to wait for my benzo tolerance to drop as I\u2019ve been using a lot of 2 milligram Clonazepam tablets lately and try a combo of Flutazolam with its chlorinated analogue Baclofen. I\u2019ll update again when I try this combo.", "author": "pretty_boy_flizzy", "score": 27, "flair": null, "created": 1585124195.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/foghiq/flutazolam_coreminal_trip_report/", "num_comments": 43, "title": "Flutazolam (Coreminal) Trip Report", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"flfp29i": {"score": 4, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/foghiq/flutazolam_coreminal_trip_report/flfp29i/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1585141675.0, "body": "Nice report dude, funny how this pops up because for a while I had been feverishly searching for trip reports on flutazolam lmao.

Meaning it is hard to overdose on. The worst experience I had was an amazing supernod where I passed out and tried to start the same movie again. Then passed out again. Literally the only bad thing was missing the movie. It's probably because I mixed it with two benzos, Phenibut, and gabs. Otherwise things are great. Even that \"bad experience\" was warm and cozy. I also actually got a better nights sleep on it than I ever plan to. It has helped me cope with bipolar disorder and PTSD. I normally have at least two manic episodes a week (lasting a day) and correlated with fears of going to sleep and staying asleep. This knocks me out in only a way high dose benzos will do but without the hangover. Literally the morning after my double nod out I had the chillest experience ever at, to or through an airport.\n\nThe reason I took a high dose was because I decided not to travel with it and with tramadol instead because I didn't wanna pack a baggie and snorting scoop. I opted instead for the trams which looked very similar to my Olanzapine. It felt much dirtier and I sought out the strongest kratom extracts once I was in a legal state. It isn't that I don't have kratom at my disposal it's just that once you're at the ceiling there are bad gastrointestinal effects not true with 2map. Trams are the second treatment I've tried to be dual opiate agonists and work on seritonin.\n\n There have been trials on Tramadol and Tianeptine, and some have been successful and Tianeptine is an approved anti-depressant in several countries but never on a full scale opioid. Tramadol would probably never work in opioid doses for depression as it leads to a dirty mental fog. O-DSMT is the chem I have now and it's only slightly cleaner with a better duration.\n2map's major downfall is it's short duration. You have to redose after 3 or so hours. But the same is true with Tianeptine.\n\nThere are other benefits.\nOn 2 repeated doses of both of us taking 20mg each intranasally, NYE was a magical evening with a girl I only kinda knew. At least for that night I knew her much better and I probably owe it to this chem. \n\nAlso sex on this stuff and a small dose of amps (RC or otherwise) is great because the amps increase sensation and 2map allows you to last n last and women can have multiples during. (I believe this stuff is only a sexual enhancer for men and only when combined with amps. Women may get enhancement from this opioid as well but for them it's mostly the amps.\n\nThe 2 biggest problems with opioids are that they are fatal and how they are illegal. My first only somewhat careful experiences with this chem were very forgiving as I didn't skimp on the rest of my complex cocktail but it enhanced it in ways that were harmless. I had good conversations, was sub euphoric happy or completely euphoric with seemingly anyone and everyone. Even if I'd dosed a bit too much. So that makes this rather safe compared to other opioids. The other pesky part of opioids is the illegality of them.\n\n2-Methyl-AP-237 is federally uncontrolled and 5 state legal as it is only an analog of a Chinese cancer drug Buccinazine which is also uncontrolled.\n\nI dare say that if taken with restraint only 4 days a week that this drug should be considered an antidepressant nootropic. Much like Tianeptine. However Tianeptine WD is often worse than heroins and the WD from 2map is only as bad as morphine WD. Some food for thought is how Suboxone allows former addicts to live normal lives even while treated with subs. If 2map stays classed the way it is, people with complex mental disorders may lead more normal lives as well.\n\nNext up for hot take Monday: Etizolam when not abused is as effective as any benzo.\n\nAlso Clonazolam in low doses may combat both depression and anxiety\n\nEdit: Also no need to go onion farming. 2map, etiz gs and clam gs are incredibly easy to find clearnet!", "author": "StoopSign", "score": 7, "flair": null, "created": 1580780148.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/eyam5b/update_2methylap237_is_my_new_favorite_rc/", "num_comments": 36, "title": "Update: 2-Methyl-AP-237 is my new favorite RC", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fghd0b2": {"score": 7, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/eyam5b/update_2methylap237_is_my_new_favorite_rc/fghd0b2/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1580810898.0, "body": "Everyone says it\u2019s garbage, but I completely disagree.

When you let go of that, you'll be letting go of those reasons that hold you to using drugs, the concepts that have made this hole you're trying to fill with substances, and you'll see countless new perspectives that you can take on that will help you cope in healthy ways.", "replies": {"g69m48s": {"score": 4, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ixycq5/let_all_sing_together_now/g69m48s/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1600846772.0, "body": "Dude amazing advice I\u2019m speechless.....", "replies": {"g69moee": {"score": 5, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ixycq5/let_all_sing_together_now/g69moee/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1600847109.0, "body": "No problem dude dissociatives have kept me alive and helped me find my way in many hard times where I thought there was no way out.

But having said that, When I did mess around with Dexedrine, Adderall,  and Methamphetamine, I was usually always fine because I always kept my doses low and very sporadicly.  And I always usually had some benzos on end, like diazepam or clonazepam incase I did have a bad panic attack.\n\nI haven't had benzos for awhile, but I do currently have a small amount of Etizolam.

It is a mu-opioid agonist, just like morphine, etc. The difference is that it is highly lipophillic with a very long half-life and delayed onset of action, making it less prone to abuse because it doesn't have a \"rush\". It also has been shown to minimally activate the dopamine releaae  that is associated with the mu-opioid receptor (G-coupled protein receptor complex). This means that it can prevent withdrawal in an opioid dependent individual, but has far less of the euphoria and is therefore safer for an addict to take.\n\nSuboxone is a mixed agonist-antagonist (meaning it elicits an opioid response while simtaneously blocking binding from other opioids).

Taking waaaay too much rc benzos everyday. Between etizolam, flualp, clonazolam, and flunitrazolam, i couldnt go more than 4 hrs without taking something. If i didnt stop i probably would of ended up dead. \n\nHeres what i did. Figure out how much of the benzos you need for a safe taper over about a month, and flush the rest. If you keep all of your shit, it will just be too much temptation. Start your taper with your normal dose, minus a little. Dont take anymore for as long as you possibly can until it becomes too unbearable. Take the dose you took earlier. Try to see how long you can go before you need to redose. Repeat this process, slightly lowering your dose each day. Do not lower your dose too quickly or else you will be too uncomfortable.\n\nJust gonna let you know, the first week or 2 is going to be absolutely awful. I did this process over about a month. Starting with 2-3 mg of flualp every 4-5 hrs for the first week, working down to 1-1.5 mg every 8 hrs by the second week, to .5mg when i wake up and go to sleep in the third week, then .1-.2 mg once a day in the fourth week. By the last week of the month, i started feeling more normal. I started only taking .1 every other day and eventually just stopped. \n\nIt is gonna be very tough and remember, going cold turkey can kill you. If you dont have the willpower to taper on your own like i just described, you need to go to a detox. I almost had a seizure during my first/second weeks multiple times. Most importantly, take your time and make sure you are comfortable and feel mostly okay. Do not rush this process you will regret it if you do.

I would do bumps of like 5 to 10mg 5 to 10 times a day and staying up until 3am, wake up for work at 8 so the lack of sleep is just another wrench into the variables. Had to choke down my dinner to act somewhat normal with my wife and kid. Also when I ran out of NEP 4fmph was my go to, 5mg dose in the AM Only no redose, suspended in PG. I took breaks from NEP only when I ran out. Man it's TOO good, one of the only drugs I just can't get enough of. I got an entire gram of clonazolam and did it once from that order anyway. \n\nThe following throws more info on what drugs  I've been doing occasionally throughout this time and also a little background \n-Light benzo addiction (1-2 mg etizolam/day) \n-4F-MPH on and off but low doses 5mg or so \n-5-10 mg Adderall (fake presses from dark web) \n-Smoke ciggarettes 10 to 15 a day, vape in house \n-Mid 30s male\n-BMI 22, 5'8 145lb\n-Eat mostly paleo, low carb, lactose interant\n-Fasting 12-16 hours a day\n-Slow pee stream, I mean I still able to pee fine but it's been like that my entire life\n-2010 diagnosed as bipolar but that was due to a heavy and abrupt withdrawal from synthetic cannabinoids aka spice and suboxone. Took the bipolar meds (lithium for less than a month) then titrated and never went back to outpatient. \n\nSo here it goes:\nIve always been able to control my cum, I have even can have an orgasm without cumming at all a lot of the timeand caused me to have my cum drip out even from a boner. Also I would pee, then when done and putting it away I have the urge like I have more pee when I do empty that it was milky cum!\n\nI know I should go see a doctor for yearly checkups, I don't but do get biometric screening for work incurance. I don't even have a physician. So after about 2 weeks into this 15+ gram binge almost everyday of this clumpy yummy NEP (I washed it, dried it. It just came(heheh) that way.) So 3 or 4 weeks ago, months after this problem arrived I went into a very very cold pool and my keigle? Muscles contracted extremely and stayed that way for the 30 minutes while I sat still with my legs crossed. Well something happened right there that helped tremendously. Fast forward to now I'm back to my old self (no NEP for weeks now I ran out not buying more). I am able to hold my cum at bay like I always have. So here's my theory, That muscle either A.

I'm primarily going to detox and treatment for my meth and benzodiazepine issues.\n\nSo let me break it down for ya: \n\nI've been addicted to opioids for around 10-years but I'm currently on Suboxone and I won't be detoxing off of that so that isn't an issue. I've taken Klonopin for about 10-years as well for my anxiety disorder (highest dose prescribed was 2-3mg daily). However, approximately 4-years ago I started taking pure alprazolam, then moved on to Eizolam, tried my share of the other common benzos (like clonazolam, diclazepam and flubromazolam) and for the past two years I've been taking Flualprazolam in varying doses and frequencies (I've always had at least 0.5mg of Klonopin everyday). \n\nAnyway, for the past year, I've been using etizolam, flualprazolam and clonazepam (not -lam) pretty heavily. I mean the year is a fucking blur. \n\nBasically, using doses of 5-10mg almost daily of flualprazolam for upwards of 6-months has noticeably impacted my memory (meth dont help either obviously, that shit is trash) as well as my other mental faculties. \n\nI'm worried specifically about detoxing because of what seems to be a general lack of education among doctors in benzo withdrawal and the appropriate way to taper someone. If I could find myself any diclazepam I would go ahead and do this myself. My girlfriend is in inpatient right now and she was doing more flualp than myself. When she was in detox they gave her **JUST 6-DAYS OF FUCKING PHENOBARBITAL FOR A 2-YEAR HABIT. NO TAPER, NO NOTHING.**\n\nI'm going to try and convince the doctors to use the Ashton Manual for Benzodiazepine withdrawal. Probably unsuccessfully, but I need to try. I want to be switched to an equally potent dose of valium and reduce by 1-2mg per day. I think my outcome will be much better. I don't get withdrawals between doses, but I have gone 14-days without benzos and it gets bad. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice for getting off RC benzos in a treatment setting? My girl has had to go back to the hospital from inpatient THREE TIMES for seizures and each time they have neglected to to anything but tell her \"seizures are part of benzo withdrawal.\" There are ways to minimize suffering. Suffering doesn't improve treatment outcomes. \n\nAny help is appreciated!\n\n\n\nUPDATE: I want to thank everyone for their support. I was just on the phone with my girlfriend. **AFTER HAVING SIX SEIZURES IN A FUCKING ROW, IN HER INPATIENT PROGRAM,** she's back in the hospital and has found a doctor that is going to, wait for it, PUT HER ON A VALIUM TAPER. Which she's been asking them all along. \n\nI'm so goddamn pissed off right now at the inpatient program, I'm putting them on blast. **If you're a woman in the state of Minnesota, DO NOT EVEN THINK about going to Tapestry Inpatient in St. Paul.** They are owned by Meridian, who now runs the Valhalla Place methadone clinics.", "author": "FateUnusual", "score": 11, "flair": null, "created": 1593777045.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/hkc3z0/going_to_detox_help_explaining_my_situation/", "num_comments": 7, "title": "Going to Detox: Help Explaining My Situation", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fws3f9b": {"score": 10, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/hkc3z0/going_to_detox_help_explaining_my_situation/fws3f9b/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1593785377.0, "body": "Def don\u2019t go wherever your gf is.

I started taking phenibut a few weeks ago to help deal with suboxone withdrawals. I have ended up dosing about 3 times a week, around 2-2.5 grams, with 1-2 times where I dosed back to back.

I didn't really realize truly how long it lasts, and I had a handful of times where I absolutely could not go the next morning without sleeping the night before.\n\nSo far, about after 2 days without taking any, I get extremely irritable and anxious, and absolutely cannot fall asleep.

If anyone has thought or can help me with my situation it would be much appreciated.\n\nI am also on suboxone. 2mg twice a day. I am also prescribed gabapentin that I will use every other day or so recereationally. I've been on mirtazapine for about a year for sleep.

I had an insane Xanax tolerance back in early 2018 and I ordered like a gram of cloneazolam (mightve been 5g don't really remember) and I was actually able to not black out for about ~4 days of the bender before I messed up. I was eyeballing all my doses but I was aware of how potent it was so I would eat super small amounts of it off my finger. All my friends blacked out and almost all of them did some stupid shit. One of them pissed in their kitchen sink while completely naked and got caught by his mom. Another dropped his pants and fell over multiple times and eventually passed out in a bando witch I left him at (he's like 400lbs). As I was witnessing this they were all telling me \"I swear I didn't black out I'm still good can I have some more\". On the 4th day my best friend drank half of a natty daddy and told me word for word \"bro I'm fine look I promise I'm not in a blackout right now\". He ended up convincing me to drink the other half. Right afterwards I check the mail box and I found 5g of MDMA that I had thought would never show up because I had been waiting 2 months for it. I knew I had to move fast because I could tell the natty daddy was going to push me over the edge and then boom nothingness.\nI woke up two days later at a public hospital. My friend ended up crashing his car later in the day and we swapped places and then I recrashed it like 5ft away from the original crash. When the cops showed up I told them that I was gonna kill myself via a heroin and Xanax overdose and they took me to the hospital. I remember being told that I had the highest level of benzodiazepines they'd ever seen in someone's blood and they tapered me off with Ativan for like 5 fucking days and it was hell. I will say everytime they gave it to me it was fucking heaven. As for the MDMA, my friends mom stole it and wouldnt give it back when I confronted her...

I did something similar a long time ago with 2M2B and Carisoprodol (AMAZING combo btw) so anyways here's some background information on me. I'm 6 feet tall, I weigh 160 pounds/approximately 72.57 kilograms, i'm 24 years old, and currently take 300 milligrams of Pregabalin (Lyrica) and 16 milligrams of Suboxone a day. I acquired  250 grams of Chloral Hydrate from a Chinese chemical supply company back in October I actually bought it as a birthday gift to myself haha. Also i've done this combination a few times in the past but I figured i'd actually write up a trip report on this combination because i'm down to the last of my Clonazolam so without any further ado here's the trip report.\n\n10:15 PM: Dose .25 milligrams/250 micrograms of Clonazolam.\n\n10:30 PM: Noticing the Clonazolam taking effect and eliminating the intense anxiety i've been feeling all day. (Thank God haha)\n\n10:40 PM: Dose 1025 milligrams of Chloral Hydrate and put on the song Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away) by Deftones.\n\n11:00 PM: Starting to notice the Chloral Hydrate (it feels like a cleaner alcohol feeling much like a barbiturate or Carisoprodol only more hypnotic although i'm only feeling that nice numb tingling sensation alcohol, the various barbiturates, and Carisoprodol are famous for) as well as an increase in sedation and muscle relaxation.\n\n11:30 PM: The effects have seemed to have reached their peak with both drugs and i'm feeling pretty relaxed, calm, loosey goosey from the muscle relaxation, and like if I were to lay down to go to sleep that it would come easily.\n\n12:40 AM: Not much has changed since 11:30. This combination usually hits me harder and is alot more euphoric when I take .375 milligrams/375 micrograms of Clonazolam but alas I only had 0.5 milligrams/500 micrograms worth of solution left and wanted to save the final .25 milligram dose for a job interview since aside from that I only have 2 1 milligram Lorazepam (Ativan) pills and half a bottle of Flubromazolam solution (the Flubromazolam is only used to end my Methamphetamine highs and binges) and I have to wait until fucking July to see my new psychiatrist to continue my Ativan and Lunesta scripts... -.-\n\n1:25 AM: I'm starting to want to go to sleep now as I keep closing my eyes and keeping them closed for longer intervals so I may go to sleep soon. Side note, some Cannabis on top of all of this right now would be nice.\n\n2:30 AM: I decide to go to sleep and of course sleep came easily.\n\n9:30 AM: Get woken up by my inconsiderate roommate who's on the phone. I feel incredibly groggy (this combination tends to make one feel groggy the next day much like Flubromazolam, Phenobarbital, and 2M2B) so I fall back asleep with ease.\n\n12:30 PM: Wake up again but this time i'm not groggy and actually feel like I got a good night's sleep and proceed to start my day.\n\nOne thing to note is this combination tends to be quite amnesiac likely due to the Clonazolam which is a fairly amnesiac benzodiazepine, I also find my 2M2B and Carisoprodol to be alot more euphoric while this combination seems to be alot more hypnotic although I can also fall asleep with ease on the 2M2B and Carisoprodol combination. I also felt like this combination didn't hit me as hard as it typically does which could be because I used Flubromazolam 3 times to end some Methamphetamine highs with my last use of Flubromazolam being a .25 milligram dose 8 days ago as well as having a few  celebratory drinks the day before I did this combination. I may come back and write up a second trip report on this combination with a higher dose and when cross tolerance won't be a possible factor in the equation. However like I said earlier I wrote this trip report while I still had some Clonazolam and it'll give you an idea of what this combination is like. Perhaps next time i'll write up a trip report on Chloral Hydrate by itself or maybe a trip report on Chlorobutanol or perhaps compare it to Chloral Hydrate.

That being said, it is incredibly potent, and I would imagine that you couldn\u2019t depend on the safety of any related chemical with no history of human use. Even the task of dosing would be incredibly dicy, I\u2019m terrified to go overboard on my usual suboxone dose but even then I know that I would just be vomiting for about 8hrs straight, the same error with an analogue could easily kill you. However, sub is a partial agonist at mu-opioid receptors, with mixed agonist-antagonist action at other opiate receptors, so if you\u2019re looking for something similar, follow that as a guide, or maybe give Kratom a shot- it\u2019s illegal where i\u2019m from so i\u2019ve never used or seen it but in terms of mild opiates i\u2019d imagine its one of the best and most sustainable.

Lots of experience with many different substances, including daily Kratom and weed use. I\u2019ve been taking small pieces of suboxone strips for the past week, and have had about 20 different experiences with 4-AcO-MET and -HO respectively.\n\nI usually take Kratom daily, but for the past week have been insufflating small pieces of Suboxone strips with some small effect. I recently got a new batch of 4-HO-MET that is dark brown, almost grayish. After allergy tests I slowly worked my way up through several experiences of gradually larger doses. Yesterday me and my girlfriend decided to try 11 mg each of this substance. \n\n\nI\u2019ve had more experience with its 4-AcO counterpart, and although the main effect profile was similar, the comeup and the initial experience was completely different.\n\nIt\u2019s rumored that 4-AcO-MET is simply a prodrug to 4-HO-MET, and thus the former takes longer to kick in, and with a smoother come up. My experience last night would lend itself to that. I\u2019ve never had a batch that looks this way, but it might be the fumurate instead of HCL. The vendor didn\u2019t specify but anyway on to the experience.\n\nWe took 11 mg in capsules with some magnesium prior to dosing. After about 40 minutes I was rapidly blasted into a fuzzy psychedelic headspace. The initial effects came on as a subtle but pleasant warmth, that gradually spread throughout my body. This lasted for ten minutes before I blasted off into strange territory. \n\nI literally felt like my body was having to break through multiple levels of the atmosphere. Tremors, and vibration took my vision as it blurred and began to shift. I was shocked that I was getting these effects at such a low dose; especially after taking up to 27 mg in the past with 4-AcO, which was more intense visually, but with less heavy bodily sensations. The comeup was intense, and I began to walk back and forth, if anything to keep the vibrations from making me sick. \n\nI wondered then if this was due to the synergy of the subs and tryptamine. I had barely felt the dose of Buprenorphine earlier, but now it almost seemed like it was weighing down on my chest and throat. I wasn\u2019t panicking, but I began to worry if this was safe.  I\u2019ve combined classic opiates with psychedelics in the past (morphine with LSD, etc.) with positive results, but now I worried about how Suboxone\u2019s different opioid structure might effect serotonin, and If the two might interact in a dangerous way. \n\nAnd then, like I had abruptly broken through the last layer of the stratosphere, the bodily sensations ended and I became completely comfortable. The comeup lasted about an hour but was gone within five minutes. This gave way to a typical tryptamine wonderland, which lasted the rest of the trip. After a couple of hours I felt comfortable smoking weed again, and did a few small dabs. I didn\u2019t have a lot of crazy visuals, but there was some movement and patterns on static surfaces. \n\nIt felt so peaceful compared to the first episode. I\u2019ve had crazy comeups before, but this was intense. The rest of the experience was super fun and typical of this chemical, but I can definitely see how much stronger 4-HO can be in terms of body load. The peak lasted about three hours before tapering off pretty quickly.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend Suboxone with psychedelics, at least not this one. The argument of combining such hedonistic drugs with spiritual ones aside, I just don\u2019t think that they gel well. Anyways, that\u2019s just my opinion.
