{"ebvix7": {"text": "Clonazolam and high potency rc benzos are fucking evil. I've been clean for months and I still keep hearing about the ways in which I behaved like an insufferable asshole. This stuff is not like etizolam or other benzos, just stronger as I thought. It changes your fucking personality. Im missing about three months. I'm so lucky to have a supportive family that has forgiven me and I'm doing a lot better. I really hope someone reads this and decides against buying clonazolam. It's not just a cheaper alternative to benzos. Other benzos are bad enough but this high potency shit is terrible. If there's any interest I can type out all the wild shit I got up to. I ended up in the hospital with kidney failure, seven substances in my body, a full ten days missing and months of fuzzy memory. I was supposed to go to Amsterdam but instead I ended up in some tiny weird German city. Couldn't walk and was totally out of it and psychotic for a few days. Fucked up.\n\n\nEdit: Im adding a description of how I used this substance because multiple people have asked. \n\nI ordered powders and compounded my own solution with EP propylene Glycol. My first solution was somewhere on the order of 1mg/ml. I was already on etizolam at about 5 mg a day sometimes more. I started off with less than one mg. I still remember about a month of daily use without much problems. The thing is that being constantly under the influence disinhibited me and made me use unsafe doses. So basically, using it 'safely' can lead to using it unsafely because you're not in your right mind. Withdrawal the amounts you mentioned you'll probably be fine. The real problems come wen you have hundreds of mg of powder or solution. I ended up ordering more and more and making stronger and stronger solutions. I put this down to tolerance which it probably was at first but ramping it up like that made me ramp it up even more disproportionately to tolerance. This benzo just kills insight.\n\n\nMost importantly, I am not in any way shifting responsibility. Everyone is responsible for their own actions regardless of what they are on. Doing something dangerous with a dangerous tool doesn't make it not your fault, but it doesn't make the tool any less dangerous. Ostensibly one could use a nuclear bomb safely. But it is still not worth it. There are so many alternatives and absolutely no reason to use this over them.\nSecond edit:\nWhat I describe as addiction to etizolam is often described by others as medical use for anxiety. I never went over two milligrams of etizolam for almost a year. I was 'only' at five when I went onto clonazolam. I never wanted to get high from any of these medications, just relief from anxiety. I really don't find benzos fun, however the relief is obviously enjoyable. However this is a very bad way to relieve your anxiety. I never did any of these drugs for fun. About three years ago I was prescribed oxy for anxiety after benzos and antidepressants didn't work. This is done very rarely in some European countries. It's even been done in the US before in a different time. The doctor taking care of me though was just a GP that was a little too sure of himself and I ended up on such a large dose it wasn't sustainable. I went onto methadone and back onto benzos. All of my use is what many here describe as medical. That doesn't mean it's not addiction nor that it helps anyone in the long-term. Anyone who thinks they can use benzos for anxiety every day, even if their dose never goes up, you are likely in for a rude awakening. While more people manage to do it than with opiates, it's still incredibly rare for that to work out and you'll always be dependent on the medication. most people on the same dose for years get absolutely no benefit and are just scared of getting off again. I've been through the gamot of likely around 30 psychologists and psychiatrists, and study psychology myself. Of them only one has had patients who do this, two in fact. It's not a desirable position and will make your problems worse in the long run. Infrequent panic attacks and phobia situations are where these medications are useful.", "author": "LSDkiller", "score": 203, "flair": null, "created": 1576616509.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/ebvix7/clonazolam_is_the_devil/", "num_comments": 295, "title": "Clonazolam is the devil", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fb7iwuo": {"score": 87, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ebvix7/clonazolam_is_the_devil/fb7iwuo/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1576620184.0, "body": ">  I was supposed to go to Amsterdam but instead I ended up in some tiny weird German city\n\ntell me about that part", "replies": {"fb7moy1": {"score": 50, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ebvix7/clonazolam_is_the_devil/fb7moy1/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1576623119.0, "body": "I will, I'll type it out a bit later when I get to the computer", "replies": {"fb88958": {"score": 26, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ebvix7/clonazolam_is_the_devil/fb88958/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1576637094.0, "body": "tiny german cities are pretty cool though", "replies": {"fb8936p": {"score": 19, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ebvix7/clonazolam_is_the_devil/fb8936p/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1576637610.0, "body": "Kreilsheim tell you anything?", "replies": {"fb8d0ol": {"score": 24, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ebvix7/clonazolam_is_the_devil/fb8d0ol/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1576640053.0, "body": "South germany instead of Amsterdam?

My first solution was somewhere on the order of 1mg/ml. I still remember about a month of daily use without much problems. The thing is that being constantly under the influence disinhibited me and made me use unsafe doses. So basically, using it 'safely' can lead to using it unsafely because you're not in your right mind. Withdrawal the amounts you mentioned you'll probably be fine. The real problems come wen you have hundreds of mg of powder or solution. I ended up ordering more and more and making stronger and stronger solutions. I put this down to tolerance which it probably was at first but ramping it up like that made me ramp it up even more disproportionately to tolerance. This benzo just kills insight. \n\nI think you'll be fine with those small amounts, just start low, go slow, and order other benzos when you're done. And should you ever get dependent on benzos use something else. This benzo is especially unsuited for daily use in a way that is not true of other benzos.\n\nEdit:\nTo say something about your use. Two things. If a psychiatrist deems the use of benzos necessary in your case you should get a prescription for a differently compounded benzo to take to a compounding pharmacy. Allergies should not be a reason for you not to get the medications you need. And about using benzos for anxiety in general. While there is a small minority of people who occasionally have panic attacks, like every couple of weeks, that then take a benzo and get better and don't need it for a while, that is not the norm. The norm is people taking it often for a general or oft occuring anxious state. All to often this ends in daily dependency. Now being dependent on benzos is something that people can sustain for AGES. I did just fine on etizolam. But that doesn't mean you're not worse off. I don't know your specific case but if you're dosing every day, then you are no different to me when I started off. The daily use of benzos for anxiety to me is dependence just like I had it. I don't see much medical value in it. When I say I was dependent on benzos that's what I mean.

You can't use it every day without getting dependent. I really do understand not wanting to live and feeling like you might as well take drugs because it's better than suicide but you will make your lot in life worse. If you really need to be on benzos like that go to the doctor. Your allergies are no problem. They can make pills or capsules that you won't be allergic to. trying to treat health problems with chemicals on the internet never works. Also, benzos exhibit cross tolerance meaning using clonazolam or another benzo won't help at all with not developing tolerance. In fact tolerance to clonazolam develops way more rapidly than etizolam which is known to be one of the less bad ones when it comes to tolerance. I know you likely won't listen to me but even if you don't PLEASE don't try to mix a powder. This will not work at all.

So to find Etizolam blotters, which I can take without suffering any noticeable adverse effects has been heavenly.\nThanks so much for your thoughts my friend I will think it's all over and take it firmly on board.", "replies": {}}}}}}}}}}, "fba6v9j": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ebvix7/clonazolam_is_the_devil/fba6v9j/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1576696426.0, "body": "Where in germany do you were", "replies": {"fba9f75": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ebvix7/clonazolam_is_the_devil/fba9f75/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1576699669.0, "body": "Kreilsheim", "replies": {}}}}, "fbbp6w2": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ebvix7/clonazolam_is_the_devil/fbbp6w2/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1576733908.0, "body": "when I blacked out on clonazolam I deep cleaned the kitchen.

I\u2019ve been clean from heroin/oxy for a while, and only taking Xanax or any benzo research chemical that I could get my hands on. \n\nI got 400 0.5mg Flubromazolam tablets and went to a McDonalds bathroom to pop them. In the past, I needed at least 20 of these tablets to feel high (my tolerance was absurd). However, I had very recently got out of rehab and had over 30 days clean, so this time I only popped 10 of the pills. \n\nI suppose it was too much. I don\u2019t remember if I took more after that, I just remember waking up in the ICU. They had a huge tube down my throat and a machine breathing for me, and I kept shitting the bed uncontrollably. I was absolutely fucked, I just couldn\u2019t believe it happened to me. I used to mix fentanyl and Xanax together all the time in high doses and never overdosed, but just 5mg of Flubromazolam was enough to make me collapse on the McDonald\u2019s floor and stop breathing. \n\nI used to think that severe respiratory depression only occurred when someone *mixed* benzos with opiates, as opposed to only taking the benzos. I was very wrong. This shit can kill you on its own, and it really doesn\u2019t take that much to do it.\n\nI was in the ICU for several days recovering from the overdose and they had me on suicide watch the whole time because they thought I was trying to kill myself taking all those pills. The cherry on top for all of this was the police finding an unmarked plastic bag with around 390 Flubromazolam tablets in my pocket. I was interviewed by the police briefly about the pills because they had no idea what they were, but luckily they didn\u2019t charge me with anything. I wondered if that was because Flubromazolam is technically legal, or because they saw that I was just a young addict and not a drug dealer.

I overdosed on etizolam and poppy seed tea back in July, so yes you definitely can overdose.

Myself being an opiate and benzo addict can attest to the risks of combining these two drugs, your playing with your life every time you take them. I just wish they didn't feel so damn good together! I guess my point is is that there could have been a possibility of the pills not being what you thought they were, or had something else in them along with the flub? Did they say anything to you about how they stabilized you? Like if they had to use narcan or something? I'm assuming the police refused to give you back your 490!

Note that I have been prescribed Seconal (one of the most addictive drugs) in the past and stopped it without a second thought. I also have no addictions and I am 49 years old.\n\nUsed to think I had chronic kidney stones so I went to the ER frequently. Often there was a stone but sometimes there wasn\u2019t. I had always assumed I simply passed it.\n\nIn 2014 I had severe pain and visited a urologist who did a CAT or MRI and found no stones and send me to a spine pain specialist. As it turns out I had broken my back when I was much younger - maybe 14-15 years old (see image). Of course, I didn\u2019t know that at the time but I did have a significant fall.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/tAcn69B.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/tAcn69B.jpg)\n\nI was treated with cortisone shots in my spine and the pain vanished within a day or two. That lasted about four years which I\u2019m told is considered a great outcome.\n\nOver the last couple of years this pain has been increasing. I had more cortisone shots about a year ago. Those helped for about two weeks and since that time it has only grown worse.\n\nAt this point I have to stay in bed for 2-3 days in order to be more mobile for a day without massive pain. As a result I have gained a lot of weight (up to 400 lbs), so exercise has become more difficult. Walking almost any distance is painful. Sitting upright for long periods of time is painful. I am doing intermittent fasting combined with Keto to help weight loss but there is only so much that can do with such inactivity.\n\nThe spine pain specialist told me that medications will not help with the exception of these cortisone pills which I can only take twice a year. I believe he may be right as at one time I did try taking Hydrocodone and there was absolutely no discernible difference in the pain.\n\nSO MY QUESTION is:\n\nDoes anyone know of anything that may be much stronger that could help me be more mobile to the point where I can lose enough weight in order to qualify for spinal surgery? I know nothing about OxiContin or Fentanyl. I\u2019m considering seeking help from a pain control doctor of some kind, but if there is likely nothing that can treat my pain to some degree I won\u2019t bother.\n\nI really need some guidance here. I\u2019m concerned that I may end up with a pain specialist who is more of a pill mill. I need help, not a high. In fact, I think the only time I have ever experience anything like that was at the ER with huge doses of morphine and I\u2019m not interested in a feeling other than NOT HURTING when I need to be more active.\n\nAny advice or thoughts are appreciated. I don\u2019t think I will live long the way things are going, and I am married with four kids (sole large-income provider who works at home).\n\nTHANK YOU!", "author": "bdunn", "score": 8, "flair": null, "created": 1581833805.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/f4gqse/severe_back_pain_help/", "num_comments": 81, "title": "Severe back pain.

Luckily my psychotherapist with whom I was talking very openly about my problems regarding pain and opioid dependency and withdrawal found a very liberal pain management doctor for me. The first who truly listened to my problems and didn\u2019t accuse me automatically. I see him once a month now and get a steady prescription.

I'm a few years younger than you but my body is probably twice as old as yours. I was an Offensive Lineman through college (UMICH'93-'97). I'm 6'8.3\" and 267-270lbs now but target playing weight was 340lbs and I made it up to 390lbs a few times during the off-season (I was also 6'9\" on the nose 20 years ago).\n\nMy body is a fucking mess, my knees not too bad but my back is cursed. Team doctors used to hand out 180ct scripts of Vicodin and Percocet, which I continued well after school. Starting in my 30's after 14 surgeries and dozens of steroid injections in the spine and nerve ablation procesudres (which burning of the nerve roots worked the best), my pain management doctors (also at University of Michigan) moved me over to the Fentanyl pain patch (100mcgr/hr on day 1 of 3 and another 50mcgr/hr patch on day 2-3) plus 10-20mg Opana (oxymorphone) 2-3 times a day for breakthrough. Fentanyl didn't work very well for nerve pain and being a purely synthetic opiate, made me super grumpy all the time. Natural opiates like Vicodin and Opana. give me a warm feeling and lift my mood.. and while taking opiates the mood natural opiates put me in did more good in helping me ignore the pain than it did blocking it.\n\nI couldn't stand taking opiates any longer though, I got pulled over once and had pain patch wrappers in my car (I would put one on out in my car before work and just toss the wrappers in the pocket of the door, but I didn't have the box they came in and got arrested in front of my children. So I told my doctors I was taking myself off everything and was just going to live with the pain. My pain management doctors said \"please, don't do that\" and wanted me to try Suboxone (the opiate abuse treatment drug) for the back pain and it worked better than anything else I had tried and I would recommend that to most people, but for me it was still not enough to justify all the hassle of monthly DR visits, monthly blood work, and monthly blood drugs tests, etc. I took that for a year before hearing about Kratom. I took myself off the Suboxone, tried Medical Marijuana for a few months which didn't do anything for the pain and then finally gave Kratom an honest effort. That was 4-6 years ago and I haven't stopped taking Kratom since. It works amazingly well. My dosage is the same as when I started and I get around as well as my 75 year-old father now, where he used to get around waaaay better than me.\n\nAnyways, I feel or have felt exactly where you're at. Have kids that need their pops but am not looking forward to the pain getting any worse. Before I found what worked and made the pain tolerable for me (Kratom), I thought about suicide, hoping my kids would understand that the pain was so intense that I spent 70% of my waking hours unable to think and only be able to say \"omfg, omfg, omfg, please stop hurting, omfg\".\n\nMy best recommendation: throw the book at it. Go to a pain clinic. They treat not only the symptoms of pain but also the psychological aspects of it too. If something doesn't work, ask them to try something else and they'll usually oblige.", "replies": {"fhw8vcx": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/f4gqse/severe_back_pain_help/fhw8vcx/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1581938108.0, "body": "Wow. This is an amazing reply! Here's some gold. And here's why:\n\nFirst off, you made me fell a lot less sorry for myself reading what you have been through. Being arrested in front of your children for your pain medication. Unreal.\n\nI have a few questions and I may DM you on some of this:\n\nHow do you go about finding a good pain medicine doctor for this kind of pain? I think we have the same kind of pain which is being caused by pinching nerves in the spine. It hurts worse than anything I can imagine (and I've had plenty of kidney stones). I am in the process of looking for real help now. Since my spine pain specialist told me no pain meds would help me, and after trying Hydrocodone and having ZERO relief like I took nothing at all, I kind of gave up. After watching The Pharmacist on Netflix, I rather ironically started to think about getting help as my life is not improving. I feel it is getting worse and fast. This is the first time in my life I had to come face to face with the fact that I am actually... mortal. Why are men/boys so damn stupid?\n\nBased on a lot of recommendations, I tried Kratom this morning and then I had a very active day (for me compared to how it's been recently). Right now I am in incredibly pain, but throughout the day I didn't feel the pain anything like I had every day until today. They were sold in pill form, and there is no dosage per pill indicated. They also sell it in powder form. Since this may have worked for me, at least for today, could you tell me more about how you take that and manage it? I am absolutely clueless about Kratom other than my experience with it today that I am literally praying was not a fluke. I spent hours with my son working on installing a CarPlay stereo in his car. I cannot tell you how wonderful something that simple was to me considering how it has been for many months.\n\nAnything you can share on what you are doing and what did and did not work for you would be appreciated.

Will edit comment with mu opinions on them\n\nMTF - I've heard one report but I don't know if it's real - it's claiming that the substance is 1/5th or 1/10th potency of fentanyl. Analog of MAF, but the user didn't report it to be euphoric at all. Short legs I think. Pretty economical if it is indeed 1/10th potency of fent but MOQ is 10 grams\n\nIsotonitazene - potency of fent (tiny bit higher), but currently very expensive therefore not worth it probably. Euphoric if you can find the sweetspot, but worse therapeutic index than fent and builds tolerance much more too. Longish legs, slow onset too. Don't trust any sources selling it by grams, scam.\n\nO-DSMT - less potent than morphine, kinda euphoric and stimulating, long legs, but not sure if economical for you\n\n2F-Viminol - the liquid version might be okay, but noone knows and it's hard to ship liquid from China. Around the potency of H so 2x-4x times morphine. Early reports were promising.\n\nBrorphine - hard to find, not recreational but potent and somewhat economical. EXTREMELY SLOW ONSET ALL ROAS AND PRETTY CAUSTIC - vaped would be best bet if you do it from time to time, or oral. Around 1mg doses i think, maybe higher.

I have been in and out for the majority of my 20\u2019s. I have had more sober time than using time.  Which is a good thing I guess. I am a 30 year old female. I haven\u2019t used a needle in a year and a half, and I don\u2019t intend to. The reason why I am writing this is because I am addicted to something else. Something that I had no idea what I was getting myself into. \n\nFirst it was etizolam pills. I told my doc and he came up with a great taper plan. It was working great. I was waiting for my last shipment to come in and BAM covid19 hit. My packs are still stuck in NY customs. So I turned to.... I don\u2019t even know what you want to call it. I\u2019ll just call it Darkness to order stuff that can help me with my w/d\u2019s. I told my doc about the shipment not being able to get here ( he\u2019s Indian and of the older generation- totally not racist or prejudice) BUT, I don\u2019t think he fully understood the extent of my addiction. I was down to 9 mg of the 3 mg Etiz pills a day, and felt great. \n\nI needed him to help me. He prescribed me fucking Librium. He knows that 3 mg of Etiz is equal to 2 mg of Xanax. He was the one that told me that. 10 mg llibrium 3x daily for a week or whenever the fuck he feels like weening down to two pills. I tried it. I was so sick. Ended up getting Xanax bar and pain went away. Now I\u2019m in this whirlwind of lies with my roommate and boyfriend because they think I\u2019m clean.\n\nI just left detox on Tuesday. I only stayed there for three days. The only reason why they kept me was because I had oxy in my system which I don\u2019t even do. I\u2019m on vivitrol. So I basically sat there for three days. They would give me 2 25 mg libs every four hours. That\u2019s another story.  I ended up leaving. So, I had been ordering 60 ml flualp 2 mg/ml I think then I have clonazolam 60 ml 1mg/ml. I also have 1 mg flualp candies. About like 70 of those. I had those stashed away because I was only going to detox appease my roommate and bf.  \n\nGuys I don\u2019t know what to do. Because when i went to the detox, and I showed them all of the meds that I was taking they looked at me like they wanted to run the other way. And that\u2019s how it\u2019s been. No one understands RC\u2019s. I want to get off completely. And I am willing. Can someone please help me, or offer any advice? I\u2019m begging at this point.

Swap out your short/medium half life benzos for diclazepam over the course of a week and then taper the diclazepam. It can be done, it doesn't really suck too much to do so (maybe a bit of insomnia, but oh well), and you certainly DON'T need to do a 1:5 dosage conversion like whatever that bullshit online benzo calculator tells you.\n\n9mg/day of etizolam can more than likely be subbed 1:1 for 9mg/day diclazepam, and you'll actually start building up diclaz in your system because it lingers for longer than a day - so you could probably hop down to less and still be OK. You're gonna wanna do an actual taper though. You're not getting clean over a weekend. I'd recommend ~5 days to switch from etizolam to diclazepam (Drop your etiz dose down 2mg a day, and bump your diclaz dose up to 2mg a day. If you want, toward the end of that transition period, you can \"front-load\" some diclazepam up to like 1.5 your normal dose, so ~15mg, but once you switch over to diclaz only you're gonna drop that right back down to normal, in your case 9mg, or less). Then just do a linear regression in steps of 18 (9.0, 8.5, 8.0,...) and drop your dose down by that much (in this case 0.5mg) every 4 days. Go a little slower when you get to that last 1mg (Maybe 1.0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25) That should be very close to 12 weeks. A 12 week taper will fix your dependence problem just fine, but urinalysis will have you failing for lorazepam the entire time (because diclazepam shares metabolites with lorazepam).\n\nRead the link.

I stopped working during corona; and well furloughed; and found out about benzo RC\u2018s. Started abusing Clonazolam really bad. Slowly tapered and I am down to 1mg a day of that. But I\u2019ve been abusing diclazepam like it\u2019s my job. Something in it; helps my back. Like, it must have missed some muscle relaxing effect because I literally feel like I can do anything, normally I can\u2019t even bend down and touch my toes but on that I\u2019m like fine, it affects whatever muscle I guess is hurting or something I don\u2019t know. My last MRI, I had a degenerating disc, two herniated disc\u2019s, a bulging disc hitting my sciatic nerve shooting down the pain to the bottom of my foot.I\u2019m on subutex for pain, since they took me off the oxy in 2012. I also take Xanax someone\u2019s but diclazepam has been what I\u2019ve been abusing bad lately. I\u2019m also on dexedrine 10mg 4x a day. I literally can take 40mg of diclazepam, 2mg kpin just when I wake up; and I\u2019m fine. Like I remember things and I function. I\u2019m just scared of the effects like I also have tried Flubromazolam and all the others but would switch it up everyday still taking my klonopin. But only 3-4mg instead of 8. Sundays only like 3 mg I don\u2019t know honestly, because I\u2019ve been having a lot of issues with my family and shit and I\u2019ve just been abusing them. Just straight up point-blank I\u2019ve been abusing them.

But the diclazepam And all the other ones that I\u2019ve just mixed on random days. I\u2019ve got a long road ahead of me right? I don\u2019t ever plan on coming off of my prescribed medication, but the research chemicals, I read about the half life. It\u2019s going to be a longer taper than anything I am imagining. Has anyone else had experiences with this? And were able to get off of it on their own? My family knows a little bit but I tell them that I just study the research in life I am interested in pharmaceuticals and helping people and shit like that. Because I\u2019m very interested in chemistry so I\u2019m very able to pull it off. I live in my own apartment but I visit them on Sundays because my daughter is there; not getting into that.

He put me on a shit upon of tramadol at first which barely helped them I researched opioids with a ceiling effect and found Tapentadol was supposedly on par with morphine for pain killing without near as many negatives, even tho it's schedule 2 also, so he put me on that after looking into it and discussing with colleagues and agreeing with my research. For 2 out of the last 3 years til I lost health insurance I was on 100mg instant release Tapentadol twice daily (only sold as SUPER EXPENSIVE brand name Nucynta) & it actually worked as well as Lortab had for me in the past without making me groggy or tired ever & often as long as I took a few vacation days at the end of each month I'd still get a decent buzz from it between taking it w/neurontin for punched nerves/neuropathy, Adderall for narcolepsy, & Baclofen for upper/mid back & neck spasms! If you've never heard of it Tapentadol is in the same family as tramadol bc it acts on opiate receptors as well as acting as an antidepressant PLUS it is MUCH stronger. If I had to gauge its efficacy I'd say Tapentadol(Nucynta) works somewhere between as well as tramadol & oral morphine only better in a way bc I've never had to increase my doseage or built up a tolerance with it like other pain killers!\n\nBased on all this info I'm hoping you could share your opinion.

It is primarily a feeling of content, relaxed but still energetic. If a run at a moderate pace, I have a feeling that my mind kind of organizes itself, I sort out the shit that I need to get done, and afterwards I have the mental energy to get that shit done. It is a natural energy, I feel recharged, more grounded, it is not that jittery push of amphetamines, it is a clear headed, natural focus.Overall, it seems to me that the chemical mix that gets released in the brain is awesome.I forgot to mention, microdoses of LSD are awesome for this purpose, it is a waste of dose for me if I dont go jogging or cycling when microdosing.I tried doing it on a low doses of amphs like 2-fma, but then I have a feeling that I am straining the heart too much, it does not feel right exercising vigorously on amphetamines.\n\nAnyway, what I am trying to say is that this chemical mix feels awesome to me, and I have not really replicated it with chemicals so far. There is a psychological component to it, it feels earned, deserved. I wonder what chemical combo would replicate it, maybe a low dose of a clean stimulant like meth (when you have no tolerance) armodafinil or 2-fma, low dose of of high class opiate like oxy or something (I have no real experience) and maybe a moderate dose of CBD. Sounds like a recipe for Nazi mix for tank drivers.\n\nIt also reduces the overall scumbag feel when you overdo stims, booze, nicotine and stimfapping.I am convinced it reduces amphetamine tolerance too.", "author": "hamletmaschine", "score": 17, "flair": null, "created": 1601453416.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/j2bg6j/replicating_exercise_induced_euphoria_with/", "num_comments": 25, "title": "Replicating exercise induced euphoria with research chemicals", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"g75b1s6": {"score": 13, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/j2bg6j/replicating_exercise_induced_euphoria_with/g75b1s6/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1601473398.0, "body": "[deleted]", "replies": {"g75wefz": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/j2bg6j/replicating_exercise_induced_euphoria_with/g75wefz/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1601496227.0, "body": "What happens if a woman takes SARMS?", "replies": {"g7734me": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/j2bg6j/replicating_exercise_induced_euphoria_with/g7734me/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1601517256.0, "body": "Ostarine is ok if it's real ostarine mk 2866.

There are a lot of user reports that SARMS work better for women, mostly because their T levels are extremely minuscule compared to mens natural T levels.\n\nSARMS would bind to androgenic receptors in skeletal tissues, and would allow a woman to tap into that sweet male T that is required to make quick lean muscle gains and cut weight quickly (men lose weight faster than women, hormone related.)\n\nSARMS do not aromatize - meaning they do not break down into E2 (estrogen), nor do they effect LH (luteinizing hormone - a sex hormone) which is also why they are safer than steroids.

A quick search here on Reddit will render hundreds of posts discouraging use and telling tales of the horrid withdrawal but after reading so much about it I had to try it out for myself and to be completely honest I am pretty amazed. \n\nDOSE: 150mg of Tianeptine sodium Orally, dissolved in water (no opioid tolerance) \n\nNOTE: Tianeptine tastes horrendous, possibly the most bitter thing I have ever consumed \n\n\\--REPORT--\n\n0:10 - Feel a slight relaxation hitting me, placebo? Not sure at this point.\n\n0:15 - Suddenly feel a strong opioid effect coming over me, I'm begging to zone out looking at my screen and a strong sensation of warmth is spreading from head to toe.\n\n0:30 - Wow the rush was incredible, I have gone from completely sober to extremely high within the span of only about 20 minutes, I feel a strong \"stoned\" sensation in my head and have all of the classic opioid effects that one would expect from a strong opiate narcotic like oxycodone or hydrocodone (If not even stronger looking back). However the sedation aspect isn't quite there, I do feel spaced out and heavy-eyed, however I have been unable to catch a nod thus far.\n\n1:00 - After my previous entry I got in bed for the next half hour. Although still feel extremely \"opiate high\" and have now nodded off a few times the Euphoria is begging to fade. \n\n1:30 - Effects are still very strong and subtle itching is begging to set in. Although I feel incredibly sedated and disconnected from my body I haven't been able to nod as much as I normally would off other classic opiates. My body almost feels as if its sinking into my bed, really nice actually.\n\n2:00 - I'm begging to return to baseline. Although I still feel some pretty decent opioid effects I'm definitely past the peak and am actually starting to nod a little harder then before, possibly because the other non-opioid aspects of the drug are wearing off? The euphoria is pretty much gone however yet physically, I still feel amazing. \n\n3:30 - The effects are almost gone now. I still have a lingering opioid sensation through out my body but I am no longer nodding and mentally I feel very tired and still slightly spacey but almost baseline other then that.\n\n5:00 Effects are totally gone, although I barely still feel a slight comfort through out my body, mentally I am completely sober and ready to go to sleep.\n\nConclusion: \n\nWow for a legal RC this is amazing. Its by far the best legal opioid I have ever tried and kicks kratom's ass if you want a classic full agonist high. Its definitely not as \"clean\" feeling as morphine/fentanyl derived opiates but its damn close. For me It felt like a mix between tramadol and oxycodone, leaning far more towards oxy if not being even stronger in some aspects. Although the peak and overall duration is short It has an incredible rush and feels no different then a strong narcotic I would expect to be given by a doctor. \n\nHowever despite my praise this drug is not all good, as I'm sure many of you know it has awful withdrawals and due to its short duration is incredibly fiendish. This is mostly because although the bodily opiate effects linger about as long as oxycodone the euphoria fades rapidly within less then 2 hours and possibly shorter as tolerance builds. \n\nIn conclusion tianeptine sodium provides a slightly dirtier and shorter but arguably stronger oxycodone like high. It feels no different from a classic opioid and I believe the potential for abuse is no less. If you can see yourself having problems with opiate use or have been dependent in the past stay far away from this drug because although the high is good it will smash all classic opioids in terms of withdrawal and tolerance.

Since it's a tricyclic anti depressant it works on multiple systems, only one of which is the mu opioid receptors. Normal prescribed doses are 12.5 mg 3x daily, so recreational doses are roughly 10 times a singular dose. The issue with that is that a lot of the other mechanisms (serotonin reuptake enhancement, glutamatergic system downregulation) do not scale in the same way as the opioid effects.\n\nThis means that to get the desired opioid effects, people have to take massive doses that end up raising tolerance/activating other pathways really quickly and aggressively. This means that while normal withdrawal from opiates can be uncomfortable, withdrawal from tianeptine is like withdrawing from an opiate, an antidepressant, and a benzodiazepine/tranquilizer all at the same time, and after a shorter period of use than a typical opioid. It would be especially strong because of the doses being 10x+ the therapeutic effect as well, meaning someone unlucky enough to kick a tianeptine habit will be in for:\n\nrunny nose, achy bones, no energy, hot/cold flashes, stomach cramps/explosive diarrhea, increased pain sensitivity, extreme restless leg syndrome, extreme feelings of sadness/depression/hopelessness, akathisia, extreme anxiety.\n\nPeople should be able to choose what they do/put in their bodies, as long as it doesn't harm others. Drug education/awareness and freedom are extremely important and hopefully attainable in our lifetimes.  That said, this is a very powerful drug intended to be used in small amounts that works on a lot of systems in a not very targeted way.

With RCs, I historically have stuck to psychedelics and dissociatives, but I continued to take pills and do other more traditional drugs. At one point I noticed some problematic behavior and cut down on my usage of addictive substances completely but about a year ago I began dipping my toes in again cautiously with pretty strict limits. Mainly, I don't take the same addictive substance/substance category more than once every two weeks, i.e., I don't take opioids more than twice a month. Anyways, I decided, somewhat recently, to give some more risky RCs a shot and here has been my experience with them, and some other compounds thus far. This will also include some non-RC substances as well.\n\n\nNote: I have no tolerance to any of these substances.\n\n\n**2-FMA:** Not much new to be said about this substance, this was actually an exception to my habit of sticking to RC psychs and dissos. I occasionally use it to study, it doesn't give much motivation to do things you don't want to do, but if you're self-motivated it can be great for staying focused. Like other stims, it doesn't make you superhuman, and you won't get through a week of work in one day, but it's nice for what it does. I wrote the draft for this post on a comedown from a 2-FMA experience. I notice the increase in focus generally goes away in 6-8 hours with oral dosing and the stimulation lingers for 6-10, although I've been able to sleep after 6 with little problem. Insufflation is much shorter and the focus lasts 3-4 hours for me while the stimulation lingers for 6. I generally take 25mg orally, then take 10mg insufflated towards the 6-8 hour mark. I have no noted euphoria, but I do occasionally feel irritable which is obviously not enjoyable. Your experience may vary though as I suspect I may have ADHD, I also am not very experienced with stims so I cannot draw many comparisons.\n\n\n**2-methyl-AP-237:** This stuff is weird. To me, the high is very similar to oxy but with a much faster onset and come-up. I'd say my absolute best oxy peak experiences were similar to the average peak experience I have with this compound. The dosage curve is odd, orally, 15mg gives me the same effect as 15mg of oxy, 20mg is much more intense, and 25mg had me nodding and on the comedown, throwing up. I suspect I'm especially sensitive to this compound. This stuff is extremely euphoric, but as others have stated, short lasting. I'd say orally I still feel some effects for 3 hours after taking it, but the first hour after the onset is the most intense and euphoric. This stuff is beyond caustic as others have noted. I use gel-caps due to this causticity, and have noted some stomach discomfort, although my stomach is naturally sensitive. I have the batch that smells like cheese and it appears to be dry. In solution, the smell is intense, and it also takes some convincing in order to get it to dissolve, but it is soluble. When allergy testing and titrating using a volumetric solution of 5mg/ml in water, the solution burnt my tongue. Due to the short duration, I tend to orally redose twice after 2-3 hours. I have also tried insufflation. When insufflated, this stuff burns stronger than anything I have had experience with. It isn't unbearable, and the result is a rush more intense than oral usage, but I personally can't see how it's worth it, even if the potency is slightly higher and the rush is slightly better. It also lasts shorter with this route, more like an hour total. The day following insufflation of even a small amount (10-15mg,) is plagued with nasal discomfort. Overall, I'd just recommend oral. This stuff frankly feels disgusting despite the euphoria, and I personally cannot imagine using this daily. I haven't tried O-DSMT, but based off of what I've read, it seems preferable despite having a lower potency and potential to be euphoric. When taking this I struggle to convince myself to swallow the caps, as frankly my brain just views the compound as gross.\n\nOne last thing I remembered after writing I wanted to add but couldn't figure out where to add it in the last paragraph: This is the first substance to ever make me nod, higher (for people with no tolerance) doses of oxy and hydro never got me to that point. It was an interesting experience, but personally I didn't enjoy it just due to the nausea I was also experiencing. I did reach a trippy dream-like state though in which I saw stories play out, I can't remember them or describe them but they felt like they lasted hours despite only being minutes. I would suggest being careful with this one, I've seen people give terrible estimates for what a strong dose is based off their own personal experience. Particularly in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/f89mg4/psychonautwiki_2methylap237/), with any substance you should always titrate up, but realistically people tend not to do this unless it's a high risk substance, and being an opioid, this is a high risk substance. **Don't take 20mg because I said that's a good dose for me, and definitely don't take 50mg because the top comment of that thread says it's a medium-high dose for someone with no tolerance. I think if I took 50mg I'd be fine physically, but it would likely be extremely miserable and I do think there'd be some risk of vomit aspiration.**\n\nOn a more \"researchy\" note, I tried reacting it with citric acid and baking soda but neither underwent visible changes. I tested the pH with an uncalibrated pH meter, the result was a 5.4. I plan to retest this and other compounds with a calibrated pH meter and with listed concentrations when I have the time. I also hope to reagent test it and post the results although this may be more difficult as it would involve posting photos.\n\n\n\n\n**6-APB:** I find I am never accustomed to empathogens, I give 3 month breaks and they usually go longer than that and as a result, I feel like I go in blind even if it's a substance I've tried before. This was my first time with 6-APB, and it was beautiful. I was in quarantine, but I was able to call some friends, mend some lost relationships, and to open up about some of my emotional troubles. I felt love for all of humanity as is expected, and overall it was one of the most beautiful and positive experiences I've had in my entire life. I found it less stimulating than MDMA, less euphoric as well but I found that added to the emotional value of the experience as I wasn't purely focused on how good it felt. The body high was alright, nothing insane. I decided and followed through with some changes to my personal life and have continued to talk with some friends who I reconnected with. As for dosing, I took 125mg initially but roughly 10 minutes later I decided to add an extra 25mg as I was not too concerned about having a strong experience. My batch was succinate and I cannot speak to it's purity.\n\n\n\n**AL-LAD:** This is my favorite substance, I haven't had it in years and spent what was ~~probably~~ definitely an excessive amount to get it. I know it's rumored to be returning so I'll hopefully get more then. I took 300ug which I know to be a safe dose for myself, but I'd obviously suggest anyone else start with 150ug to be cautious. It was just as I remembered it, little anxiety, heavy visuals, etc. I actually even ended up watching the news on the comedown as the coronavirus situation began to be taken more seriously by the general public. I had an amazing experience and I don't see any other substance taking its place as my favorite. It provides introspection without a push and has had a large positive effect on my life.\n\n\n**Etizolam:** Feels like any benzo I've tried, I never really get anything out of them. I blacked out a couple times due to compulsive redosing but I don't really do anything irresponsible when blacked out. Delusions of sobriety exist, but I know for a fact I'm objectively not sober throughout and just don't *feel* anything. I cannot give logic behind my redosing but I tend to be at least a little careful about it, I find 6mg is my limit. I also find that I usually just fall asleep eventually. I'm not a fan of benzos/thienzos, but they're good to keep around and my main motivation for using them is to smoke a lot of weed without getting anxiety. I have anxiety sober, but to me the loss of anxiety benzos/thienzos bring isn't euphoric or anything, it's just a nice break. Maybe in a social setting this would be more enjoyable, but I have my qualms about using addictive drugs to treat emotional pain and social anxiety as I personally believe that can easily lead to severe dependency. I may try this as an alcohol replacement or take it in low doses and very rarely for social situations, but it's another one I can't see myself doing frequently, especially given the risks that come with physical addiction to these kinds of drugs.\n\n\n**Kanna:** Not an RC but I think it's worth commenting on as it's new to me. I have the MT55 extract and I've tried it twice, once at 50mg insufflated and the other at 50mg smoked. When insufflated it gave a short rush and mood boost and did feel similar to an empathogen, but much much more mild. I noted increased empathy as expected, but overall it was more of a novelty than a full experience. As stated earlier, I don't believe in using drugs to numb emotional pain, but given the low addictive and harm potential of this substance and how I view it as somewhat pointless for recreation, I may just use this occasionally as a little mood boost. Insufflating is unpleasant but not as bad as I was expecting and it does not burn at all. I can't comment much about the smoking RoA as it was mixed with weed and weed tends to give me anxiety if I smoke too much, and well, I smoked too much. The weed definitely overpowered it and I was more focused on keeping myself calm than I was on the effects of the kanna.\n\n\n**Continued in comments**", "author": "alladthrowaway033", "score": 25, "flair": null, "created": 1586307757.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/fwo57h/last_months_of_research_summarized_2map_mxpr/", "num_comments": 15, "title": "Last months of research summarized (2MAP, MXPr, & other more common substances)", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fmpdq92": {"score": 9, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/fwo57h/last_months_of_research_summarized_2map_mxpr/fmpdq92/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1586307810.0, "body": "**MPT:** I can't really give a great report on this one, I've only tried it once and it was an introductory, low dose experience. I smoked 25mg out of an oil burner and not all of the material properly vaporized. I used a normal lighter but think this substance likely needs a torch, this may also be due to my oil burner being thicker than average but it was my first time using one so I can't compare it to any others. It definitely had an effect but it was pretty weak as expected given the dose and incomplete vaporization. From what I could tell, at the low dose it was at, it had a very light but still somewhat introspective headspace. I had open eye visuals and very mild closed eye visuals which is notable as I rarely get CEVs in general. Like I said though, pretty light dose and I look forward to increasing it eventually. \n\n\n\n\n\n**MXPr:** I initially wrote a long first impressions post around this substance, but now that I have 3 experiences under my belt and plans for a fourth next time I have free time available, I think I'll just summarize my findings here and write a longer post in the future when I feel more experienced. Prior to trying this I read through the entire bluelight thread, which was at the time 20 pages, and I also read every report I could find on reddit. Overall, it seemed people either really liked it or just found it disappointing. I tried it at 35mg, 45mg, and 65mg, my three main takeaways were as follows:\n\n1.) A lot of people report the duration of the desirable effects is too short while residual dissociation lingers for too long. I personally didn't find this to be the case, there was a very noticeable shift in effects at the 2 hour mark for me; however, the experience after that point seemed more akin to low dose dissociative experiences than it did to residual dissociation. I personally found it enjoyable, similar to taking a 30-50mg line of 2F-DCK.\n\n2.) A lot of people referred to the substance as cold, I am not very experienced with dissos, most of my experiences have been with 2F-DCK with a few experiences with regular K and DXM mixed in. That being said, I didn't find this to be much colder than those substances, but to be honest I can't say I'm 100% sure what the \"cold\" feeling is referring to. It did feel more \"clinical\" than other dissos I've tried, but it wasn't significant, and I personally enjoyed it.\n\n3.) I saw a few people saying this substance has a headspace that was more difficult to manage than other dissos. In my experience this was true, I found it harder to maintain my composure on this substance in comparison to other dissos. That being said, I did not have a bad experience nor did I feel like it would take a bad turn at any point. I'd say my experiences were simply more introspective and emotionally demanding than they are usually on other dissos, and they were also slightly more confusing.\n\nAs for dosing, I found that at 65mg oral, I was just below holing territory. I have not insufflated the compound as I heard it's somewhat caustic, and due to this I also plan on testing it's pH when I get the chance.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Phenibut:** Also not an RC, but I tried this twice at 1.5g. I found this one interesting as it wasn't like benzos where I feel nothing but a reduction in anxiety. I understand this works primarily on the GABA B receptor rather than the GABA A receptor, but the noticeability of the effects still caught me off guard. I can't fully describe the feeling but it was pleasant, warm, and somewhat similar to alcohol. I have the HCL form, which apparently can cause some stomach discomfort, and I've noticed that both times I took it I got nauseous. I'll probably go for a lower, more functional dose next time and hopefully I will have less stomach discomfort.\n\n\nApologies if my MXPr or MPT reports have any grammatical errors, I wrote them when I was tired as I forgot to include them initially.

I originally used loperamide to help me after my doctor took me off gabapentin when I was abusing it, and I couldn't sleep or think at all without it. I was abusing it heavily, getting two prescriptions from two doctors a month. Given that, it was a recipe for disaster with someone with an addiction problem.\n\nWhen the second doctor took me off, I was looking online for literally anything I could have help and nothing illegal because I was on probation (I did and have been smoking marijuana throughout all of this, it never helped and it was very strong, it was probably sativa). I came across a few posts mentioning loperamide (an anti-diarrhea medicine) as a last measure means for withdrawal from mainly heroin or methadone and the like. I was desperate enough because I really did feel like I was going insane, so I ended up finding some and took about 20mg to test it. I don't know if I felt it at all but I do think I slept a little bit that night. \n\nThe next few days I didn't take anything besides a new 10mg/12hrs propranolol prescription for the withdrawal. It wasn't helping so I decided since I wasn't allergic to the loperamide, I would up the dose and see one last time if it would actually work. I ended up taking about 50 pills so 100mg, and I didn't feel it at all. At least at first... It felt pretty heavy in my stomach, but I gave it a few hours because one post said it would take a while to feel anything. What I felt in the next 4-5 hours later could only be described as pure bliss, akin to how oxy would feel if it was a little less euphoric (still a lot), along with it lasting a whole 2 days. There is the initial rush for about 3-4 hours, then the next couple days is just a steady high and I nod a ton during this. \n\nI'm just writing all of this to give you context, now my questions are\n\nA: Is it better to continue using loperamide or go to O-DSMT?\n\nB: If it's better, is it worth searching for a vendor or is it rare to find?\n\nThanks so much in advance!", "author": "Blowing_Snow", "score": 2, "flair": null, "created": 1588241279.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/gamww2/odsmt_question/", "num_comments": 14, "title": "O-DSMT Question", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fp0pc5d": {"score": 8, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gamww2/odsmt_question/fp0pc5d/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1588242785.0, "body": "If you feel like you need some opioid don't go to O-DSMT and for sure get off the lope.

Used to mess around with 40mg ir oxy back in 2016. Loved it for a little while but a combination of it being incredibly expensive and a looming addiction caused me to kick it before anything bad could happen. Now, for whatever reason, my interest in opiates is back. The way I understand the difference between these two is that O-DSMT is the RC closest to a traditional opiate but it\u2019s relatively low potency. This one interests me because it seems to be lower risk due to it being a metabolite of a well-studied chemical. But it\u2019s biggest con is that I would go through it faster due to its lower potency. 2-methyl-AP-237 on the other hand is much more potent, and would last me a lot longer, however it\u2019s safety profile seems to be more questionable. If, say, a gram of both of these chemicals is the same price, which would you recommend and why? Or is there another chemical that you\u2019d recommend over both?

Divorced about a year ago (official in two weeks) and started a daily kratom habit, usually under 10 gpd. No access to opiates but when I've come across them I'm zero to low tolerance; I've probably never gone higher than 20-30mg oxy but usually start off feeling it from just one 5/325. I've had tapentadol and tramadol a few times, same idea just 2-3 max and had good results. Recently I was gifted like a years supply of 300mg gabapentin and small amount of a few other things (methocarbamol, carisoprodol, buprenorphine) so I've been using those since I ran out of kratom. Right now I'm using belbuca (0.3mg/300mcg of buprenorphine) and even that was strong enough to feel pretty good for me on days 1-2, currently tapering down before I run out of it. \n\n\nBackground TLDR: \n\nLong-term high weed tolerance with recent sensitivity to high THC. 1 year kratom use with low opiate tolerance, no experience with benzos/dissociatives/psychs/stims other than caffeine (coffee/energy drinks in excess). Recent divorce, mainly self-medicating for depression/anxiety but I've found I really enjoy a nice nod as well. \n\n\nI'm planning to order:\n\n-ODSMT (O-desmethyltramadol)\n\n-2map (2-methyl AP-237)\n\n-Tianeptine\n\n-2F-viminol\n\n-Etizolam\n\n\n\nOrdering (no sourcing):\n\nIt appears I can order all of these in low quantities from various clearnet websites. Should I expect any issues with that? Etizolam for example appears to be available in pill bottles like a legal otc product. I'm assuming price wise I'm probably getting ripped off but I just want to place a simple quick order without spending over $50-$100 (per RC) for now to see if they even work for me. That should be fine, right? \n\n\nAdditions:\n\nKetamine has always sounded interesting & I saw some posts about dck/2-fdck, I need to do more research first but does that seem like it belongs on my list? Or any other varieties of etizolam in addition to or instead of it? Is there a mellow psych readily available that I need to at least try?\n\n\nPreparations:\n\nI know I need to get a mg scale for some of these more than likely to dose correctly & safely.  Probably some smaller capsules too? I have 000 caps for kratom but they can fit almost 1g. Any specific reagent testing kit recommended? I can research that more on my own once I know what I'm buying though I guess. \n\n\nWarnings:\n\nI've already heard horror stories with tianeptine so I'm gonna be extra careful with that. & I think I understand to be careful with etizolam and treat it like I've heard about Xanax (taper down, can cause seizures, minimize mixing with alcohol, etc). Anything else to watch out for here? I tend to mix lots of things in low amounts like: kratom/opiod + coffee/energy drink + weed/cbd with a bit of tobacco & then in the evening the same combo with alcohol instead of the coffee/energy drink. Lately gabapentin (1-2gs over time) has been added to the mix. Do you foresee any dangerous combos between those and my list?\n\nIf you read all this I really appreciate it, I tried breaking it into sections to make it more readable.

Also, I have no idea why more RC vendors don't sell ODSMT. This chemical, to me, shows so much promise, and yet it is still hard to come by.\nAnyway, I just wasted to share my amazing experience mixing these two. I fully understand how dangerous it is to mix \"benzos\" with \"opioids,\" (I've had several friends die from mixing too much oxy and xanax.) This combination is, to me however, totally different. \n  ODSMT has a a bit of a stimulating effect, and etizolam, being a thienodiazepine, does not quite have the same \"fear factor\" as traditional benzos, so the mix feels a bit \"safer\" (emphasis on the quotes because nothing about ANY research chemicals is truly safe.) \n  Now on to the specifics of my experience. I started with 15 mg of powdered Etizolam (using a 0.001 scale, and like I said earlier, I have quite the tolerance to etizolam.) After swallowing that, I prepared approximately 170 mg (again, high dose) of ODSMT for injection. The powder dissolved easily in water, and the resulting liquid was not caustic or \"syrupy\" or anything like that. (I'm haunted by my attempts in the past to inject 100 mg plus Tianeptine Sodium and the damage it caused to my veins.) ODSMT produced a clear, clean shot with no change in consistency of the resulting liquid. The etizolam added that perfect mix of benzo and opioid relaxation. \n  ODSMT is an RC Opioid that doesn't have anywhere near the the dangers of the fentalogues, U44's and others out there. It doesn't have the seizure threshold issue that traditional tramadol has, (I have had four seizures as a direct result of taking WAY too much tramadol) and doesn't cause the serious vein and tissue damage that Tia causes if you prefer to IV like I do. \n  Other RC Benzos like clonazolam, flubromazolam, flualprazolam etc etc I believe would be too much. I realize saying this kind of contradicts the fact that I took 15 mg of etizolam, but something about etizolam feels less \"scary,\" even at high doses.\n  So that's it, that's my take on my two favorite RC's and hope more vendors decide to sell ODSMT. I also would like to double back on the dosages I took... 15 mg etizolam oral and 150 mg ODSMT IV. These dosages are extremely high, particularly with the etizolam. So, if you are thinking about trying this, please don't use anywhere near these levels until you feel like you've reached that level of tolerance. \nThis whole post might sound extremely naive, but I just wanted to share, after searching and searching for the right combination how excited I am to find what works for me.

Idk what the duration of effects for either is(i do know 2-map-237 is shorter than conventional opiods and i believe troparil is around 2x as long as coke, but i could be wrong), but if they are EXACTLY THE SAME (or troparil lasts longer) it will be much SAFER than if they are NOT THE SAME.\n\nThe biggest issue with speedballs is that a CNS stimilant mitigates the respiratory depression caused by the CNS depressant. Therefore, if using a CNS stimulant with a shorter duration of effects than the CNS depressent it is combined with, the extent of CNS depression will not be noticed until the CNS stimulant wears off. This makes overdosing very easy.\n\nAdditionally, cardiotoxicity may be a concern, as well as a specific interaction between 2-map-237 and troparil (you can check for combinations of 2-map-237 with coke for a little peace of mind).\n\nThere is some information, what you choose to do is your own perrogitive. That being said, speedballs are generally not recommended due to their high risk of overdose. They are one of the most euphoric experiences out there, so people continue to do them. They cause a lot of deaths, particularly with celebritied (think Kurt Cobaine, Jim Morrison, etc.)", "replies": {"gab4et4": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/jj5p9p/2methylap237_troparil_mix/gab4et4/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1603858442.0, "body": "I tested both and Troparils effects are ca 20 min longer ime.
