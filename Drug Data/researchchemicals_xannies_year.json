{"j4abm0": {"text": "I wanna have a pill bottle of etizolam candies that look kinda like pills, and sweet tarts dont really have that look. Pez somewhat do, and im considering using those. Theyre almost like a small xanny. My question- Are there any plain, small, circular candies that you guys prefer to drop it onto to make tablets? I just want them to look nondescript. My storage bottle will be well labelled, mind you.\n\nAs to why I want them to look like this, its just something that satisfies my junkies psyche. Im not a bad drug abuser anymore like I used too, but the feeling of having something like etizolam pills satisfies my addict mindset and helps me appreciate it and not over do it. I need to feel like im doing something bad, kind of.

I had taken about .5 before and didn't feel jack shit except like a super strong melatonin type feel.... no crazy dreams or anything.\n\nWell lets fast forward a week when a research supplier supplied me with a huge free tube of it as a delay for my original Pyrazolam research supplement. Now heres where things get crazy.\n\nI'm like Ok if were going to do this it's (I never do heavy research chems after I learned my lesson the fucking HARD WAY) it's going to be right before bed and I hope to god I have lucid dreams. I think about ***1mg*** was ingested this time. Took about 40 min to knock me out but all i felt was tired... ***wouldn't use it ever in daytime.***\n\nOn to the dreams.... holy shit....there were at least 5 but can remember a few for you.\n\n# SEXY SEWER GIRL\n\n**1)** I was living in a sewer with a girl who was super hot and just rats were crawling all over the place. I was like can we please get out of here and she was like \"But there is plenty of food here\" and I saw her like eat this rats head off and I started running through a series of never ending tunnels and panicking and finally woke up. Holy shit it was scarier than it sounded.\n\n# Alligator eats me in a floatable donut tube\n\n\\*\\*2)\\*\\*Ok so I was swimming in a lake near the shore when I see an alligator approach me... this thing knows it wants to eat me and I know I'm about to get eaten.... I'm in a like donut rubber inflatable and was just too dumb to realize to jump out and start swimming as this thing is slowly coming at me. I'm like 8 feet from the shore and can swim like William Hung (a beast.. but look up the reference). So I'm flapping with all of my power and by golly this thing is looking like its giving me every single chance in the book to get away and is like why is this guy so STUPID.... eventually he chomps me and I wake up again in a panic.\n\n# Hit and run/ running around buck ass naked\n\n\\*\\*3)\\*\\*This was the oddest dream I've ever had. So i was at the beach down in Florida... maybe Miami? One my my family members let me drive her most expensive car with was probably over 80k. So all is good im just tanning on the beach, going swimming, having fun... and the issue starts when I leave.\n\nSo I'm backing up with a back up cam installed which who would even really notice in a dream i just looked in the back mirror and who do I ram my car into a female cop car, and who just got out of jail? So naturally I decided I just fucking BOOOK it and hope to get out of there and out run them. Wrong. There was some car parked like in the center of the exit **diagonally MIRACULOUSLY**. This is where the lucid part kicked in, in this dream. Tasers and guns damn sure weren't in play so I knew I could outrun them in my dream. So I run into a building to hide.... what building do you think it is? THE FUCKING POLICE STATION.\n\nNot only that, I look down and I am ***completely naked*** so I'm like what the fuck should I do... I couldn't open any door the cops would be there any minute so I just run up the stairs. I ended up in the mail room and hid in one of the mail bins. They started digging through the mail bins cause there was really nowhere else to go... found me and I woke up in a panic.\n\n# Job Interview Nightmare\n\n**4)** **FINAL DREAM**I was in a job interview for the first job I'd ever truly wanted that makes over six figs. So I'm going through my resume with the hiring manager thinking holy shit I got the best job in the world and my luck has finally change. He asked why I wanted to work there and my about my background and I had **THE WORST BENZO SLUR EVER POSSIBLE**. Dude it was so bad I couldn't even formulate sentences like I had eaten 8 2mg xannies. So things started getting lucid and I'm thinking Oh god why did I just do that. So i try to muster up strength but can't make any sense to this poor hiring manager who has no idea why I'm slurring and look like my eyes can't open. Then i realize I'm in a lucid dream and like start throwing shit and running around, *get naked* and trying to find the sexiest girls ever.\n\nSo I'm walking naked as fuck down the freeway, knowing I'm in a dream...and not giving a fuck. The cops don't seem to fuck with you when you are in a lucid dream.\n\nThen the worst PANIC sets in. So I guess I was staying at my parents house until I got my job and I realized that the thermostat was set to 65 degrees (what I currently sleep in, in my own apartment). And now it's a full out sprint to get there, naked as fuck, to turn it up to 74 degrees. lmfao Woke up after that scare thank god and was so thankful that I live alone because sometimes I forget when I wake up. I'm an introvert and hate being bothered by people in my own home.\n\nSo in final words: the dude who said flub gives lucid dreams was definitely right. I had lucid dreams in a fair share of them... there were more i just forgot to mention. They were all really entertaining and terrifying at the same time.... but once you realize it's a dream its fucking baller. I will try again tonight and see what happens. **And for the record yes when I am lucid dreaming. 99.9999999% of the time I'm getting naked and just running around or like wreaking havoc.**  \n\n\n  \n***EDIT----- SHOUT OUT TO DUDE WHO PLANTED THIS IDEA IN MY HEAD ABOUT LUCID DREAMING ON FLUBROMAZOLAM....
