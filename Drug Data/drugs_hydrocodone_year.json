You propose to implement unenforecable rules which say one thing and yet the apparent aim is to communicate something different, hoping that the readers somehow understand this hidden message. \n\nThere are a number of problems with this.\n\n1. People don't read the rules. Fair play to you if you have but I suspect under 20% of the subreddit members have actually ever looked at the rules page. It's not really their  fault, reddit's design makes them hard to find and apps are no better. I wish that people understood the obligation to know the rules of a community one participates in, but that's a discussion for another day.\n2. You say yourself that it won't work to keep under 18s out. \n3. Writing a rule gives an obligation for the moderators to enforce it, yet this rule would be impossible to enforce.\n4. Saying one thing when you mean another is extremely confusing to someone who is already new to the topic.\n5. Being 18 years and 1 day old does not magically make it safe to use drugs. Indeed I would change your quote: \"There really is no truly safe way to use drugs ~~when your brain is still developing~~\".\n6. It makes people hide their age, which is an important piece of information when community members are giving advice. If a 16 year old comes and asks about the safe dose of hydrocodone then they will get VERY different answers depending on if they say they are 16. In this case, **the rule would cause harm.**\n\n\nAs much as we wish it did, abstinence based education doesn't work. It is not Harm Reduction. It is not in line with the principles of Harm Reduction. There is published research on this topic and it is the reason that in-person support services also do not exclude under 18s.

They're still in a better position as it's their garden they're going to have to live off of long term\n\nIf you get yourself right with your mind, heart and soul and clear of negative energy, then the feeling that there's a hole can be filled up. It's a sustainable intimate feeling of a \"mother's love\" that gets normalized instead of pain, even late in your life, even if you and your own mother skipped this part because you couldn't bond with her and she's no longer here. I only call it that because if you ascribe to gender roles traditionally it's the mother that teaches this tenderness that you must feel towards yourself, you can see this wisdom even in most centered children, something that the rich have been trying to figure out how to buy since the day they were born. The understanding that you were born perfect (and this is true for as long as you have your human soul and a heart that can break, regardless of what you've done). Just because humans typically get this from their mothers, you can learn this from yourself but you need someone. a father, friend or lover.. anyone. As long a you're focused on growing genuinely but it takes a friend you truly love and can connect with, like true family, not necessarily birth family even if they're good people. You need people who you believe are genuinely going to respect and support the relationship you're growing with them where you can care for each other almost as one being. This takes courage.. A unhealthy relationship that quickly disintegrates generally consist of at least 1 person trying to believe something false about themselves and relying on their partner's belief in this lie about themselves in order to feel like it's something that was actually achieved, it's a toxic relationship that can become a pattern and should never be sought after. Rather, a good relationship is one where you're striving to see yourself through your partner's eyes and hopefully you don't crumble in realizing you've been lying to yourself about a great many things in order to evade responsibility or flawed coping mechanisms. If you're ready, an intimate relationship that isn't abused can be a great tool for growth and that's where you find love. Have the courage to hunt your demons, never be afraid that it means something about who you are to the point where you avoid it, that's the only way that can become a part of you, understand how it got in, learn how your spiritual vulnerabilities come from false concepts that were likely formed by no fault of your own, it comes from a misunderstanding that's cured by wisdom of experience, that cursed energy is changed to good stuff when they're no longer able to torment you. Be strong and face it. When you win, you won't need any drugs to feel okay, and after a long day they'll be sweeter and last longer... It's worth it and less terrifying than anyone ever thinks no matter how terrible they believe they are or how much they believe they belong in hell", "replies": {}}, "fvyg20b": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/hffmkt/im_seeing_alot_of_young_people_on_here_recently/fvyg20b/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1593123645.0, "body": "I agree with OP.

So at 18 after leaving home and becoming a \"grown-up\" I had a boyfriend that was almost ten years older and I had a lot of friends that were the same age around that time. So I was introduced to pain pills but it was heroin that really turned my head. I thought it was great. Minimized the addictive qualities and told myself I could use it a couple times a week. Thats just lying to yourself.\n\n I am a Gen Xer from Seattle and it was the height of popularity. I hung out with our local musicians that became superstars and many are gone today. If I could do it over again I wouldn't. I'm now looking at the rest of my life on methadone and I'm also addicted to benzos per my doc.

Some of the listed substances are considered \"research chemicals\" and have not been studied at all. Furthermore and most importantly, some of the listed drugs/combinations may even be fatal when taken in high doses so please be responsible! Please beware of the risks, do your own research and evaluate carefully, if you still want to try some of my suggestions. Stay safe!**\n\nAs there's dozens of posts on Reddit every month asking what drug is best for (...) purpose, I figured I want to create a list with the 5 drugs or drug combinations that are best or more accurately most effective/efficient for the most commonly asked purposes and reliably produce these effects.\n\nIn my opinion, the following psychotropic drugs (+combinations) are best for (...) and I will briefly explain why:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*(listed in no particular order)*\n\n##tripping for psychedelic veterans / deep mind-exploration:\n\n**LSD / 1cP-LSD**: I don't think I have to really explain why LSD is on this list. An 8-12 hour trip which can be extremely intense and ego-shattering in high doses. Very beautiful visuals, an analytical but very deep headspace and the potential for strong spiritual and religious revelations.\n\n**Psilocybin mushrooms / 4-AcO-DMT**: Oh the good ol' mushrooms. High dose mushroom trips had me fucked up and trapped in my head like no other drug and taught me more than most substances. Psilocybin can be very confusing with its weird headspace, but the beautiful, organic OEVs and the connectedness to mother earth are absolutely stunning and make it a 'must' on this list.\n\n**5-MeO-DMT**: I have not tried 5-MeO-DMT personally because honestly, I'm a little scared, but my friends that tried it said that it was more intense than regular DMT and that it probably is the most intense psychedelic known to date. Witnessing nothing and everything was never closer together. A white pit of emptiness and complete ego-loss. Recommended for experienced psychonauts only.\n\n**DMT**: I think DMT is the most unique and the most breathtaking substance I've ever consumed. It has without a doubt the most beautiful and the most intense CEVs out of any drug. If you take a high enough dose you experience the so-called 'breakthrough', an incredibly intense and possibly life-changing experience with (possible) entities, machine-elves and other weird presences.\n\n**DPT**: Its able to completely eradicate every sense of reality and fucks with your mind like only a handful of substances can. It presents a sinister and eerie vibe for some and a lot of people don't really enjoy the compound. Nevertheless, DPT is very mind-bending and should be treated with utter respect. It definitely deserves a spot in the category 'most intense psychedelics'.\n\n...all of the listed substances can be combined to achieve stronger effects, but I advise starting with a lower dose than you usually take as combining psychedelics is highly synergistic! Be careful.\n\n**honorable mentions**: 2C-E or 2C-P / DOB or DOM (these 4 substances have a really long duration, stimulation, very strong bodyloads, crazy visuals and are able to induce very strong synaesthesia! Imo the novel psychedelic phenethylamines/amphetamines are absolutely amazing and underrated!)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##tripping for noobies / beginner-friendly hallucinogens:\n\n**Cannabis Edibles** (atypical psychedelic): Cannabis edibles can be very psychedelic and are able to induce visuals, a strong euphoria and a very unique headspace (which feels different to the headspace of smoked Cannabis). I suggest starting with a low-dose and working your way up as Cannabis edibles are notorious for being underestimated and then surprising the user with uncomfortably strong effects.\n\n**2C-B / Mescaline HCl [low-dose]** (psychedelic): 2C-B is one of my favorite psychedelics, because it's so versatile and easy-going. It's amazing for tripping with friends, listening to music, having sex and also partying (in low-doses). It has a very manageable headspace, beautiful visuals, a short duration and can become pretty euphoric! It feels like a light-version of Mescaline, which can be a very good beginners psychedelic as well, but due to it being very rare in HCl/Sulphate form this doesn't seem like a realistic/viable choice as preparing a mescaline-containing cactus takes time/practice, induces quite a bit of nausea and is unpredictable in its effects because its hard to properly dose.\n\n**AL-LAD / LSD [low-dose]** (psychedelic): AL-LAD is getting rarer day by day, but if you get the chance to try it then I would! Its like a shorter-lasting (~8-9 hours), more visual, less confusing and overall more recreational acid. Good as a starter psychedelic and to get a feel for LSD. Don't worry, if you can't find AL-LAD, because LSD can be a very good beginners psychedelic as well in light to medium doses (~75-100ug). Lysergamides are a great option for tripping outside in summer, because of their long duration, great color-enhancement and potentially euphoric effects. They positively enhance music and can be very recreational, if you don't take too high of a dose.\n\n**4-HO-MET / Psilocybin mushrooms [low-dose]** (psychedelic): 4-HO-MET is a pretty popular research chemical of the tryptamine family and is closely related to Psilocybin (magic mushrooms). They share many similarities, but 4-HO-MET is considered to be a gentler, less confusing, more visual and more recreational substance compared to mushrooms (similar to AL-LAD with LSD and 2C-B with Mescaline). It's cheap, readily available online and legal in many countries. If you have mushrooms then I suggest starting with a 1-2.5g dose for medium effects in strength. Just ride the mushroom wave and don't fight their effects, they are amazing little fuckers. ;)\n\n**Ketamine / 2-FDCK** (dissociative): Now listen, I know Ketamine is not considered to be a psychedelic so tripping may not be the right word (getting wonky might be more fitting), but it's a dissociative which is considered to be a hallucinogen. Ketamine can get pretty weird real quick but its generally not as anxiety-inducing as psychedelics, because it also has numbing/tranquilizing effects. Ketamine's effects only last for a very short period of time, so if you get overwhelmed its not really a big deal because half an hour later the effects will be significantly diminished. 2-FDCK is like a less potent, often cheaper, less sedating version of ketamine and also legal in many countries. I prefer regular Ket over 2F-Ketamine, but if you can't get ketamine for some reason 2-FDCK might be for you.\n\n**honorable mentions**: MDA or 6-APB (two long-lasting entactogens with hallucinogenic properties. They are not really considerered psychedelics, but still are good starter drugs as \"rolls\u201c are easier to control than most trips)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##social-setting / partying:\n\n**Alcohol + Cocaine**: Alcohol plus Cocaine is one of the most popular drug combinations around the world and rightfully so. Both substances somehow enhance and cancel out their effects at the same time and create a pleasurable, euphoric and talkative high. Unfortunately, this combination is very dangerous and should be avoided on a regular basis. When both drugs are taken together they create the toxic substance Cocaethylene in your liver, which is way more harmful than each substance individually. Not to mention the addiction potential of either substance. Be careful and take long breaks!\n\n**Alcohol + Amphetamine**: Also a very pleasurable combination! Stimulants usually reduce the intoxicating and depressant effects of ethanol which leads to more drinking and can lead to a delayed alcohol poisoning once the amphetamine wears off (The risk is even higher with Alcohol + Cocaine, because Cocaine has a much shorter duration than Speed). Alcohol sort of takes the edge off a stimulant which makes this a great combination, BUT the comedown/hangover is absolutely horrendous.\n\n**Amphetamine + MDMA** (+Alcohol): This combination is pretty popular in the rave scene even though amphetamine slightly diminishes the effects of MDMA when taken at the same time in my experience. Some people feel too out of it and don't experience enough energy on MDMA alone, that's why this combination is so established in Europe, as it keeps you going for the whole night. I strongly advise against combining these two substances as amphetamine increases MDMAs neurotoxicity and its an enormous strain on the heart, especially in high doses. The comedown is dreadful.\n\n**4-FA / 4-FMA** (+Alcohol): These two fluorinated amphetamines are the most recreational and the most enjoyable out of the bunch imo. They are pretty similar, but most people I know (that have tried both) and myself included prefer 4-FA, but its not readily available atm. 4-FA feels like a lighter version of MDMA for 2-3 hours and then transitions over into classic amphetamine-like stimulation for another 4-5 hours. Its doesn't produce a remarkable hangover and has relatively few noticeable side-effects compared to 4-FMA, which feels a little dirtier but definitely stronger on the stimulatory and empathogenic effects. Both substances are research chemicals with only little history of human use and I recommend doing a lot of individual research before consuming them.\n\n**3-MMC / 4-MMC** (+Alcohol): 3-MMC (Metaphedrone) and the more popular 4-MMC (Mephedrone) are empathogens of the cathinone family and they produce highly euphoric effects. Both substances are pretty fiendish and can lead to many \"unplanned\" redoses, because I and many people don't experience a ceiling-effect (like with MDMA), which means you experience similar effects in intensity with each redose. 3-MMC feels more dopaminergic and more stimulating, while 4-MMC feels more heavy on serotonin, thus inducing more entactogenic and more MDMA-like effects. I find 4-MMC to be superior to 3-MMC, but both substances are worth trying out if you have enough will-power.\n\n**honorable mentions**: 2C-B [low-dosed] + Alcohol / Ketamine [low-dosed] / 5-APB or 6-APB / GHB or GBL / Alcohol \n\n&nbsp;\n\n##non social-setting / relaxing / alone-time:\n\n**Alcohol**: A beer after work is great, nuff said.\n\n**Cannabis**: A joint after work for winding down is also great, nuff said.\n\n**Dissociatives** (Ketamine / DCK / MXE / etc.): Dissociatives are a very unique class of drugs and can produce extraordinary experiences (e.g. holes) that are best experienced alone in bed with your favorite music playing. They are not for everyone and can lead to bad habits, but a k-hole is an experience which is so utterly bizarre and fascinating that I think they deserve a spot on this list. Dissos are also amazing for watching movies/videos and creating an immersive and exciting experience for the user. Use sparingly!\n\n**Benzodiazepines** (Diazepam (Valium) / Triazolam (Halcion) / etc.) **\\[low-dosed\\] + Alcohol \\[low-dosed\\]**: Probably one of the most controversial combinations on here because it's well-known that alcohol and benzodiazepines in combination can lead to respiratory depression and possibly death, but taking low-doses of each substance doesn\u2019t pose a serious risk and is very euphoric and peaceful. A little .125mg Halcion with a glass of red-wine and a puff of weed is seriously underrated and also deserves a spot on here. Don\u2019t go overboard with this combination and be responsible! \n\n**Opioids** (Dihydrocodeine (Paracodin) / Hydrocodone (Vicodin) / etc.): Fucking with opioids is always a gamble because of their addiction potential and that's the reason why I stay off them, but to probably nobody's surprise they feel great. Perfect mix of sedation, euphoria, anxiety-relief, pain-relief etc. and are just optimal for relaxing at home. If you decide to try them regardless, I suggest sticking to lighter opioids like Kratom, Codeine, Dihydrocodeine, Tramadol and use very sparingly.\n\n**honorable mentions**: Muscle relaxants (Carisoprodol (Soma), etc.) + Opioids / Antihistamines (Promethazine, DPH, etc.) + Opioids / Benzodiazepines [low-dosed] + Opioids [low-dosed] / Barbiturates\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##pure pleasure / hedonism:\n\n**Cocaine [IV or smoked]**: Users report that when cocaine is IV\u2019d it creates a bell-ringing noise in one\u2019s ear followed by an extremely intense euphoria far stronger and not even comparable to that of insufflated cocaine. Smoked crack cocaine is also insanely euphoric, but a very short-lived and fiendish high, which often leads to compulsive redosing. Using cocaine IV or smoking crack is highly addictive and I dont advise doing so. Binging on cocaine can easily lead to stimulant psychosis so beware!\n\n**Methamphetamine \\[IV or smoked\\]**: I have never smoked or injected methamphetamine let alone tried it, but judging from people's experience it must be one of the most intense and euphoric highs achievable. I'd stay clear, especially if you like stimulants. If you decide to use it regardless then stick to using it orally, its way less fiendish and you don't experience that notorious meth rush which users like so much. Binging on methamphetamine can easily lead to stimulant psychosis so beware!\n\n**Pyrovalerones (a-PVP / a-PHP / MDPV / etc.) [vaporized]**: Pyrovalerones are potent stimulants which induce extremely powerful euphoria and are notoriously fiendish when vaporized (similar to methamphetamine, but shorter lasting and reported to be even more addictive.) I have no personal experience with them, because imo they are high-risk substances and most of them have a short history of human use. If you still want to try a pyrovalerone please be very careful and use sparingly, if that\u2019s even possible. Binging on pyros can easily lead to stimulant psychosis so beware!\n\n**Heroin \\[IV\\]**: I've never IV'd Heroin and probably never will because the risks outweigh the benefits. A Heroin nod is one of the strangest things to look at, but apparently its a state of extreme bliss and contentment. You're floating on a cloud where nothing is bothering you and you don't care about anything. It's heaven and hell at the same time. A nod is weirdly psychedelic (similar to hypnagogia) and its like falling in and out of a really euphoric dream. Beware of Fentanyl or other potent cutting agents, always start with a low dose and have your drugs tested if that's possible. Always keep Naloxone (Narcan) on you!\n\n**Oxymorphone (Opana) \\[IV\\]**: Opana is arguably the most pleasurable painkiller available in the US and probably the most addictive. Oxymorphone to Oxycodone is like 5-MAPB to MDMA, so more sedating, more euphoric and longer-lasting. I've never tried it personally and it's pretty much non-existent in Europe, but don't let big pharma fool you Oxymorphone is just as pleasurable and addictive as Diacetylmorphine (Heroin), which btw is also prescribed in a few countries. Please be careful and don't use this compound, if you don't already have an opioid-tolerance. As little as 3-5mg (intranasally) can seriously mess an opioid-naive person up. Always keep Naloxone (Narcan) on you!\n\n...Speedballing (mixing a stimulant with an opioid) is arguably more enjoyable and more pleasurable for most users than either substance individually. I strongly advise against mixing uppers with downers because of an increased overdose risk and an increased strain on your circulatory system! Stay safe!\n\n**honorable mentions**: 4-FMA [IV] / 4-MMC [intranasal] / 5-MAPB [intranasal] / MDMA + Nitrous Oxide\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##sex:\n\n**WARNING: All of the following drugs are imo even more pleasurable when mixed with GHB/GBL. They are vasodilators and make you horny as fuck, but this poses a serious threat to one's health and can easily lead to overdoses, because GHB and GBL are very dose-sensitive and compulsive. Dont redose before 2 hours have passed and stick to low doses! Please, only use GHB/GBL if you have done your research and never mix them with other depressants as this easily leads to an OD. GHB and GBL are also physically addictive, so use sparingly. Stay safe.**\n\n**3-MMC / 4-MMC + GHB**: Cathinones make you a horny monster but like with other stimulants they are vasoconstricters meaning it's sometimes difficult to get or stay hard. GHB is a vasodilator which does the exact opposite. Well, I think you know what Im coming at here. They are very synergistic and make for a very pleasurable time. But regular sex on these drugs can be very addictive and makes 'normal' sex almost boring (also goes for the following two combinations). I have to emphasize that mixing uppers/entactogens with downers can be extremely dangerous and should be avoided at any cost. If you still want to do it, please be responsible and use low-doses!\n\n**MDMA + GHB**: Very similar to the previous combo but more lovey-dovey and feels more personal, but still makes for a great time. I have to preface that mixing uppers/entactogens with downers can be extremely dangerous and should be avoided at any cost. If you still want to do it, please be responsible and use low-doses!\n\n**Amphetamine / Methamphetamine + GHB**: Combining stimulants and depressants can easily lead to compulsive redosing, increases your risk of an overdose and puts more strain on your cardiovascular system, especially when you mix in a 6 hour session of raw fucking. Mixing uppers/entactogens with downers can be extremely dangerous and should be avoided at any cost, but if you still want to do it, please be responsible and use low-doses!\n\n**2C-B + GHB**: One of my favorite combos ever, even when not used for sex as the G reduces the anxiety of psychedelics but enhances the euphoria. 2C-B was originally sold as an aphrodisiac and the combination of G and 2C-B is absolutely godlike. Highly recommend this combination if you're careful and you know what you're doing.\n\n**5-MeO-MiPT + GHB**: 5-MeO-MiPT's effect profile is a mix of an entactogen and a psychedelic. Its incredibly amazing also when used without G and without sex, but getting it on while on Moxy is freaking amazing. Especially with GHB.\n\n**honorable mentions**: LSD + GHB / Cocaine + GHB / Pyrovalerones + GHB / GHB or GBL / Phenibut / Cannabis + Alcohol\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##productivity:\n\n**Modafinil + Caffeine**: Relatively low abuse-potential imo because Modafinil is not really recreational, but it gets the job done. Long duration and especially when combined with caffeine you're most likely gonna be really productive.\n\n**Methylphenidate + Caffeine**: Similar to Modafinil and Caffeine but Ritalin is stronger, more euphoric and has bit more abuse-potential. It\u2019s still a good choice for productivity, but please don't use any of these drugs regularily, if you don't wanna become and emotionless human being.\n\n**4F-MPH** (+Caffeine): 4F-Methylphenidate is the RC super-version of methylphenidate. Stronger, cheaper, longer-lasting but not medically approved and thus pretty much an unstudied substance. Its very cheap and works well if your tolerance to Ritalin is too high, although I\u2019d rather taper or cut back if your tolerance is through the roof. Please do your own research!\n\n**2-FMA** (+Caffeine): 2-Fluoromethamphetamine is one of the most popular stimulants for productivity in the RC world but still pretty much an unstudied substance. Works better than 4F-MPH for productivity imo and has less side-effects. Its also readily available on the internet and really cheap. Please do your own research!\n\n**Lisdexamphetamine** (Vyvanse): This suggestion may be a little controversial and some people might prefer Adderall or Dexedrine over Vyvanse. I'm not saying I prefer Lisdexamphetamine over e.g. Adderall in general, but purely for productivity Vyvanse is the better option. Granted, the other suggestions are probably better choices anyway, because they are not as euphoric, so they\u2019re more functional and have less abuse potential.\n\n**honorable mentions**: 3-FPM (+Caffeine) / IPPH (+Caffeine) / Dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) / Levo + Dextroamphetamine (Adderall) / Dexmethylphenidate (Focalin) \n\n&nbsp;\n\n##my favorites:\n\n**Alcohol + Cannabis**: This combination is very common and absolutely amazing, if you mix them from the get-go or start with the Cannabis. Being drunk and smoking can make you nauseous and dizzy, if you dont have a tolerance. Great music-enhancement, they cancel out their negative effects and produce a strong euphoria.\n\n**2C-E**:  Its like 2C-B\u2018s big brother and demands more respect, feels colder, more visual (although darker), has a more loopy headspace and has a significantly stronger and different bodyload. Side-effects like nausea, stomach cramps, etc. are also worse. Its capable of producing euphoria that 2C-B wont be able to achieve, but is also able to induce a far stronger sense of dread and panic. More risk, more reward.\n\n**2C-B + Ketamine**: That's something special haha. It can be quite frightening to be numb and not being able to move while tripping because you're so aware of your dissociation, but the euphoria, the visuals and the bodyfeeling are absolutely incredible and out of this world, when you're prepared. Start lower than usual with the dosage on both substances. I advise taking bumps of ket when you feel comfortable on the 2C-B.\n\n**AL-LAD + 2C-B**: Unbelievably euphoric and the visuals were so impressive, that I couldnt believe my own eyes. Still relatively easy to control mentally but the visuals were so intense that I had to lay down because everything was whirling, spinning and moving. Absolute madness. Probably not the best idea if you're prone to HPPD.\n\n**4-HO-MET / 4-HO-MiPT + 5-MAPB / 6-APB**: Doesnt really matter what substance your mixing but the 4-substituted tryptamines are highly synergistic with the benzofurans. Its like a longer-lasting and better Hippie-Flip (mushrooms + MDMA). It can get pretty wild so don't take this combination lightly.\n\n**honorable mentions**: LSD / DMT / 4-MMC / 4-FA and a few more.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThank you for reading and I hope this post was somehow informative!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**EDIT: Thank you all for your nice words! As I predicted, there\u2019s a lot of controversy around what the best drugs or combinations are for different purposes, but people keep in mind that we\u2019re all different and this post should be taken with a grain of salt. I read all the comments and I gotta say that I\u2019m still happy with my choices, THE ONE THING I COULD\u2019VE MENTIONED THO IS \u201cSPEEDBALLING\u201d (An upper mixed with an opioid) in the \u201cpure pleasure / hedonism\u201d category. This feeling is arguably more pleasurable / enjoyable for some than opioids or methamphetamine alone. Thank you u/JuniperHillInmate for this suggestion!**\n\n**EDIT 2: Thank you for my first gold award stranger! I appreciate it!**\n\n**EDIT 3: Thank you for another award! :)**\n\n**EDIT 4: multiple grammar edits**\n\n**EDIT 5: added honorable mentions in all categories.**\n\n**EDIT 6: I reevaluated my choices in the \u201cpure pleasure / hedonism\u201d category and came to the conclusion that pyrovalerones and cocaine [IV or smoked] are better fits than 5-MAPB and MDMA, as they are purely recreational and arguably even more euphoric.

I loved Aleph but I had a pretty shitty experience when I tried MAL, but the product may have possibly been degraded.\n\nOn my bucket list is: Mescaline, Proscaline, 2C-B, 2C-B-FLY, 2C-E, 2C-C, 2C-I, 2C-D, 2C-T-7, 2C-EF, DOM, DOC, DOI, DOET, HOT-7, 25E-Nboh, 25B-Nboh, and 25I-Nboh\n\nEdit: if we count lysergimides I've tried LSD, AL-LAD, 1P-LSD and ALD-52 as well.

Do they clamor for the banning of alcohol each time someone gets drunk and plows into some pedestrian? \n\nOf course opioids aren't the only drugs out there, but that market needs regulation more than any of the other drug markets which is why I'm using it as an example. \n\nOf course pamphlets won't always be enough. Neither would the test, nor prohibition. What pamphlets won't also do however, is open the market up to be exploited by people with less than stellar intentions and the know how to access a pill press, xylazine, any of the myriad fent analogs, or any other harmful or caustic substances and making an entrepreneur of themselves.

Yes it does for sure! Is speed from the street doing more harm? Yes! \nIf people want to crush it up and smoke the motherfucker let them do that, inform them that this way it's more addictive but also let them make free decisions.

I think we have a lot of overlapping opinions and that there's one simple thing that's causing our difference in approach. I believe, very strongly, that there are some drugs that should never be touched, eg: meth, heroin and crack. There is no good reason a person should choose such substances, or have the option to do so. You believe that everyone has a right to make the choice of what they take, and whilst I accept that view in most situations I think that certain drugs are simply too addictive and harmful. Someone who is fully informed, educated and self aware can still slip into addiction. This happens all the time, and always will. Some people will make the argument that adderall is similar to meth and codeine is similar to heroin etc, which is true and that's why we will never have a perfect system. However, drugs with such high abuse rates (heroin = 1/3rd of users become addicted), and are extremely physically damaging (neurotoxicity of meth) in my opinion, cause infinitely more harm than good. Also, you're correct about the current state of research chemicals, but countries are starting to crack down on this. Here in the UK, we have the Psychoactive Substances act that passed in 2016 which doesn't allow for any, even new rcs, to be sold or shipped to the UK.

Let people make the most informed decisions they can, that's the best we can do. I don't know if in reality this will also apply to the strongest narcotics we know of, but I am quite sure that to do things science is teaching us since long ago, would be better than the current situation. Not without side effects, but then we can work on them, on step at a time.

In my observation it just isn't really working. They do create new substances that can avoid it, the law can't cover all substances and drug classes and even if it one day does, than there will be just again the black market. You can ship illegal RC's into Germany, the chance your packet will be found by the agencys is miniscule. Popular ones like MXE are already produced illegally.

Some are way more prone to hangovers than others, an you can make the point that the ones who don't are at a higher risk of addiction.

This allows you to get a feel for how the substance is potentiated and reduces the possibility of overdose\n\nPOTENTIATION IS BEST USED ONLY OCCASIONALLY. Chronic potentiation can result in significant diminished returns and potentiators can alter other substances one takes as well. I do not advise chronic daily potentiation of substances aside from something like magnesium or similar substances.\n\nNote on agmatine: Agmatine is very finicky, I suggest only using occasionally as it effects a very wide range of receptors. Many report increased euphoria from many substances when using agmatine, while many report agmatine dulls the euphoria of some substances\n\nLSD/LSA potentiation:\n- Coluracetam: strong potentiator of lysergamides, coluracetam appears to have potentiation effects on psychs and dissos comparable to that of noopept, which suggests (along with the fact that coluracetam increases acetylcholine production) that coluracetam may be more similar to noopept than any racetams\n- Piracetam: potentiates LSD by about 1.5 times\n- Fasoracetam: minimal testing done on this combo but it appears to potentiate lsd by about 2 times\n- Huperzine A, CDP choline, Alpha GPC: make the experience feel more magical and enhances thought processing and visuals\n- note: Aniracetam appears to be the one racetam that significantly dulls psychedelics (possibly due to decreasing 5HT2a binding affinity)\u00a0\n\n\nAmphetamine potentiation:\n- 1/4 tsp baking soda or tums 0-30 minutes before dosing (acidity increases excretion of amphetamines and decreases length of high as well as worsens comedown)\n- Agmatine: potentiates the euphoria and overall experience; noticeably increases length of beneficial effects for me (*Dose low on the agmatine: 250-500 mg; more can dull euphoria)\n- low dose memantine (5-20 mg)\n- low dose dxm (30-60 mg; more is hard on the heart)\u00a0\n- Turmeric w black pepper/piperine: increase euphoria and smoothen out the experience; decreases comedown\n- Magnesium: Mild NMDA antagonist; helps lessen tolerance buildup as well as reduces bruxism\n- NAC (low dose only; 400-600 mg before and redose when comedown becomes uncomfortable): NAC aids in reducing dopamine depletion from amps and reduces the comedown significantly for me\n- Huperzine A: Increased euphoria and cognitive effects, brings back the magic for me. Very good to mix for a study session\n- Yerba mate: Mild MAOI; noticeably enhances effects and feels much better than other forms of caffeine on amp\n- Other sources of caffeine\n- Racetams: unpredictable potentiation, can cause anger or too much stimulation for some. Mixing racetams and amphetamines could also potentially cause glutamate excitoxicty, so i dont recommend mixing them (if you do mix them, take creatine and/or low dose memantine with it because both aid with glutamate excitoxicity. note: creatine is more effective for reducing glutamate excitoxicity). Fasoracetam and coluracetam enhance amphetamine the best ime\n\nOpiate potentiation:\n- Quercetin (250-500 mg 30-60 min before dosing. *Use caution when mixing quercetin with opis as there is evidence to suggest quercetin is effective at reversing opi tolerance\n- 30-60 mg DXM 30-60 minutes before dosing\n- 5-20 mg memantine 3-4 hrs before dosing\n- 25-50 mg DPH, hydroxyzine, or promethazine 30-60 minutes before dosing\n- Agmatine:\u00a0 potentiates the pain relieving qualities and increases length of substance (*Dose low on the agmatine: 250-500 mg; more can dull euphoria)\n- Tagamet/cimetidine 30-60 minutes before dosing, inhibits liver enzymes\n- Grapefruit juice or grapefruit seed extract for liver enzyme inhibition\n- Turmeric with black pepper: enzyme inhibition \n- Blackseed oil or extract: enhances euphoria, length, anxiolysis and analgesia\n- For fat soluble opis (kratom, hydrocodone, codeine, tramadol): fatty snack or drink 20-30 minutes after dosing\n*Tramadol: Start with either 50 or 100 mg, and redose 50 mg every 30 minutes after initial dose for maximum high, fatty snack 20-30 minutes after first tramadol dose here helps tremendously with the increase in absorption. Stagger 50 mg redoses every 30 minutes up to 300 mg tramadol total.\n\nDXM and possibly other NMDA antagonist potentiation:\n- Blackseed extract or oil: Strong potentiator of all aspects of DXM ime, enhanced anxiolysis as well\n- White grapefruit juice or grapefruit seed extract for liver enzyme inhibition\u00a0\n- Cannabis \n- Lysine (amino acid): appears to potentiate DXM anecdotally and subjectively; possibly due to lysine\u2019s 5HT4 antagonism. Lysine increases the dissociation and euphoria significantly for me, id highly suggest the combo due to how cheap lysine is in powder form. Its possible i experienced potentiation of memantine from lysine but i havent gotten to trial that again.\n- Turmeric with black pepper/piperine: increases euphoria and warmth a large amount\n- Noopept: increases DXM visuals and improves cognition while on DXM and allows for increased trip memory retainment (5-15 mg is sufficient)\n- Coluracetam: Increases DXM visuals a lot and enhances antidepressant effects as well as improving trip memory retainment (10-20 mg is a good dose)\n- 25-100 mg DPH for liver enzyme inhibition and visual potentiation (can make DXM feel too dirty for some)\u00a0\n- Yerba Mate\n\nCannabis potentiation:\n- Turmeric with black pepper/piperine: consume 30+ minutes before cannabis\n- External sources of terpenes from plants and herbs (lemongrass for myrcene, thyme for thymol)\n- Anandamide containing substances such as cacao\n- External sources of cannabinoids including nutmeg, kava, dark chocolate, and ceylon cinnamon\n\nBenzos:\n- Turmeric with black pepper/piperine: Enhances anxiolysis and\u00a0\n- Blackseed extract or oil: Increases overall effects and length. Enhances anxiolysis and provides some euphoria\n- Lemon balm or ashwagandha: GABAergic herbal adaptogens that improve the overall experience and increase euphoria and anxiolysis\n- Kava: Gabaergic\n\u00a0- Agmatine: Enhances anxiolysis and increases length (dose low: 250 mg should be enough, more may decrease desired effects)\n\nPhenibut and gabapentin (possibly pregablin/lyrica as well):\n- Agmatine: Enhances anxiety relief and euphoria (low dose only; 250-500 mg is all you need)\n- NAC (N-acetyl cysteine): Enhances anxiety relief and body high/warmth, strong potentiator for me (only use 400-600 mg for potentiation). NAC modulates glutamate and dopamine\n- Acidic substances consumed while dosing (coffee, lemon/lime jucie in water, etc)\n- Fatty snack consumed 15-30 minutes after dosing (only for gabap or pregab, not phenibut)\n- Staggering doses appears to increse the efffects of both of these substances; split phenibut dose in half and dose each half with on hour seperating the doses. Stagger gabapentin in 300-600 mg intervals each 30 minutes for best results (increases bioavailability)", "author": "Sohrey", "score": 157, "flair": "I :love: Drugs", "created": 1593738579.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hk0yiv/the_ultimate_drug_potentiation_guide_updated/", "num_comments": 83, "title": "The ultimate drug potentiation guide [Updated]", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fwq05fb": {"score": 60, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/hk0yiv/the_ultimate_drug_potentiation_guide_updated/fwq05fb/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1593742133.0, "body": "Mangos for weed (myrcine)", "replies": {"fwrdqv1": {"score": 5, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/hk0yiv/the_ultimate_drug_potentiation_guide_updated/fwrdqv1/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1593767927.0, "body": "I'm fairly certain that is mostly a myth.

SSRIs and st. john's wort prevent lots of serotenergic things from working but they don't unpredictably skew stuff as much. agmatine 100% is ruinous for amphetamines for me and plenty others. literally amplifies every negative aspect of amphetamines and diminishes every positive aspect. i have done this repeatedly and thoroughly. and not at very high doses, but 500-750mg, which is normal, but I do mean repeatedly over time, such as every day or most days for at least two weeks. I would absolutely never advise agmatine in combo with amphetamines b/c for plenty of ppl it ruins it. for others apparently it potentiates it. it also ruins any moodlift from kratom for many ppl, and completely reverses the effects of gabaergic/certain depressants. where alcohol and kava and taurine were previously sedative and foggy for me, they became highly stimulating and clarity-inducing after agmatine. again, this is after prolonged use of agmatine, such as 500-750mg/day for a few weeks or more, which is of course very common usage of it. noopept and other racetams often offer nothing but brain fog after their honeymoon period wears off.

I\u2019m sure I\u2019m still missing some from this list. I did not include supplements or nootropics.\n\nRatings\n\nWeed - 10/10\nEven though I have had tons of highs that were full of anxiety and paranoia, I\u2019ve had plenty that were great. It\u2019s very safe, versatile, and can potentiate pretty much ANY other substance.\n\nAlcohol - 4.5/10\nIts a dangerous substance overall and I hate the taste, but it comes in handy in many social situations. I would rate it at a 9 for the positive effects and a 1 for the negatives as the negatives are worse than just about any other substance I\u2019ve tried.\n\nCaffeine - 5/10\nHas it\u2019s used but still gives me a crash which is sometimes not worth it. Overall I\u2019m glad it\u2019s around.\n\nKratom - 7.5/10\nWith no tolerance and good leaf, I would say the rating is closer to a 9. With bad leaf the effects are more like a 1. It\u2019s a pretty safe alternative to more dangerous substances which is what gives it a higher overall score.\n\nMDMA - 8.5/10\nEuphoria is out of this world. It changed my whole perspective on music permanently. In the right setting, it\u2019s an unforgettable experience. It would be a 10 if it wasn\u2019t so unsafe. Once or twice a year is fine, but I abused it when I was younger and it made me feel more depressed and worse than ANY other drug ever has before or since. I will only use it in a candyflip now and just don\u2019t feel the need to use it anymore. I did have some incredible experiences on it though and I also loved the nystagmus. Comedowns can be awful too. \n\nMDA - 8.5/10\nLess euphoric than MDMA but I had some of the most unique visuals on it when combined with weed. Still very similar to MDMA.\n\nLSA -  4/10\nWaaay too tired on this. Tried both MGS and HBWR seeds. MGS made me so sick that the thought of it makes my stomach turn 10 years later. HBWR seeds gave me actual psychedelic effects, but it\u2019s so hard to stay awake. Doesn\u2019t really compare to classic psychs.\n\nDMT - 10/10\nHoly Shit. Even the most intense LSD trips of my life don\u2019t compare to vaping DMT. My reality was shattered for weeks following my first experience. I still can\u2019t believe people can experience this.\n\nSalvia - 1-10/10\nI don\u2019t know whether to give this a 1 or a 10. The experience was as intense as DMT but full of fear. I still think about my breakthrough experience even a decade later. Even though it\u2019s terrifying, it is one of the most fascinating psychedelics I\u2019ve ever tried.\n\nLSD - 9.5/10\nBy far my favorite long lasting psychedelic. The entire world comes alive, dancing with geometry. I\u2019ve had lasting life changing experiences from LSD and have quit other drugs because of it. Combination with MDMA is the best combo of all time IMO. The revelations and feelings of oneness are unforgettable. It would be a 10/10 if it wasn\u2019t for the comedown and after effects running into the next day or 2 for me. I still love LSD though and always will.\n\nMushrooms - 8.5/10\nI\u2019ve had some insane experience on mushrooms full of love. I usually feel better immediately after a trip than before. The comedown is always so euphoric but I usually feel more uncomfortable during the trip than with LSD. I don\u2019t think the visuals are as pretty either. The body load and sedation is what keeps this score lower than LSD... plus the fact that it\u2019s just simply not as enjoyable as a good LSD trip.\n\n25c-NBOMe - 2/10\nFeels way to intense in a dirty way. Put 2 of my friends in the hospital during one of our trips and gave another one of my friends a seizure. The first 2 times we did it were okay which is why it isn\u2019t a 1/10. It is a very hollow experience though. Would never try again.\n\nKetamine - 9/10\nLow doses are fun. High doses are insightful. The best part is that I feel great for a week after using it. IM is much more intense than intranasal. \n\nDXM - 6/10\nSurprisingly good for what you can get at a convenient store. Haven\u2019t touched it in years though. Ketamine just feels like the cleaner version. High dose just has so much mind fuck that it can be unbearable. Great combo with weed whippets and music though. I\u2019d say my few experiences ranged from terrible to blissful. It\u2019s hit or miss and sometimes you will get itchy AF! Ketamine is better though IMO.\n\nSynthetic cannabinoids (unknown) - 2/10\nOnly smoked these (K2 and whatnot) as a teen because weed was illegal. Actually felt addictive. Some experiences were fun, but overall it is just such a dirty experience. Weed is safer and overall WAY more fun!\n\nAdderall - 7/10\nVyvanse - 6.5/10\nNothing better for focus. I would smoke tons of cigarettes too. Always got a good amount of euphoria from it. Only thing that doesn\u2019t combine great with weed is stimulants though. Daily use lead to lack of motivation, sleep deprivation and occasionally psychosis after too much sleep deprivation. I got so skinny and so constantly tired that I haven\u2019t touched either of these in years. I can\u2019t stand upper comedowns anymore. It was fun for a while but overall no longer a fan.\n\nCocaine - 3/10\nFun while drinking ONLY but shit on its own. Short duration and barely any euphoria. Tried multiple times and still never got anything from it unless we were drinking.... in which case it just helped us drink more. \n\nRitalin - 1/10\nSo inferior to amohetamine IMO. Made me feel awful during AND after. Couldn\u2019t even concentrate on it well. No euphoria, only uncomfortable side effects and a jittery wired feeling.\n\nFlexeril - 3/10\nGood for muscle tension... makes me very sedated in a not so pleasant way. Some use to potentiate opiates but I think it made them feel dirtier. \n\nSoma - ?/10\nI took a lot with some Xanax one day and woke up 24 hours later with my ex gf super pissed at me so... not sure how much I enjoyed it!\n\nKava - 4/10\nWas fun when we finally found some that worked. Problem is the hangover and the nausea. Overall not really worth it IMO.\n\nNitrous oxide - 6/10\nGreat (9.5/10) in combination with dissociatives or psychedelics but pretty useless by themselves unless you are at the dentist. \n\nGabapentin - 8/10\nPossibility for strong euphoria if done correctly. Best thing is feeling like yourself but completely anxiety/stress free as opposed to other gabaergics. Downside is tolerance builds basically immediately. \n\nLyrica - 8/10\nLike Gabapentin but somewhat trippier. Also need a much lower dose than Gabapentin too. Gabapentin is much easier to function on though which is why I gave them both 8/10.\n\nPhenibut - 7.5/10\nThere is a couple hours in the middle of a Phenibut experience that feels like a 10/10, but that is usually preceded and followed by a lot of strange side effects. I used 3x a week for a month once and couldn\u2019t believe the withdrawals I had. Primal fear is a good description. Won\u2019t use more than once or twice a month now and haven\u2019t had an issue. Wish the duration wasn\u2019t so long. Great in combination with LSD though!\n\nGHB - 5/10\nSuper fun at the right dose. Reason for the somewhat low score is that the dose response curve is way too sensitive. Trust me that no one wants to see you G out!\n\nAmbien - 3/10\nLunesta - 3/10\nI can\u2019t even give these a good score for helping to sleep because it never made me fall asleep, only hallucinate. These hallucinations would be like people hanging from my fingers or sleds running around the room. Tried a few times and not interested in trying again.\n\nDiphenhydramine - 1/10\nOnly use this for allergies. Deleriants are just not my thing. Tried it once when I was young and felt awful. Nasty hallucinations.\n\nBenzos - 5/10\nXanax - 4/10\nValium - 5/10\nKlonopin - 6/10\nAtivan - 6/10\nDefinitely still has a use for comedowns, but that is all I would ever use it for now. Daily use I would rank at a 1 due to the loss of memory, idiotic behavior, and horrifying withdrawals including but not limited to seizures and constant panic. All benzos feel pretty similar and really only the duration and level of sedation differs IMO.\n\nNicotine - 6/10\nI quit smoking cigarettes but still vape. I\u2019d like to think I hate it but in reality I quite enjoy it... especially with other substances.\n\nOpiates - 8/10\nHydrocodone - 7/10\nOxycodone - 8/10\nMorphine - 7/10\nPoppy Tea - 8/10\nCodeine - 7/10\nHeroin - 9/10\nAll of these feel pretty similar and I\u2019m only separating those that feel much different. Opiates if used responsibly have given me some of the most fun dates and most euphoric experiences. When abused I would give them a 1/10 due to the hellish withdrawals and severe lack of motivation. Poppy Tea has probably the WORST withdrawals since it last for hours and hours on just one dose. Poppy tea is the only one I almost OD\u2019d on consistently. Daily use of any basically just makes you into a dick. The high rating was more so before dependence and now I wouldn\u2019t go back.\n\nTramadol - 5/10\nI\u2019ve had some experience that I would rank higher (9/10), but I\u2019ve also had some very uncomfortable ones I\u2019d rank at a 2/10. Only euphoric in higher doses but that's when your seizure threshold lowers. Gave me a seizure after quitting Xanax from only one week of daily use. Can be good but too dangerous overall even compared to other opiates/opioids.\n\nTianeptine - 2/10\nWas good one time then the next made me feel super strange from the antidepressant effects. Not worth it and I hear withdrawals are terrible. Super short duration and barely feels like a traditional opiate.\n\nSuboxone - 4/10\nHelped me stay off opiates before I learned Kratom was a better alternative. Was sometimes good and can make you nod but rarely euphoric. With no tolerance you will most likely be sick. Withdrawals from suboxone are up there with Xanax. I had to come off both simultaneously and I will never be touching this stuff again.\n\nSeroquel - 4/10\nGood trip killer and good to sleep. Only included it because the sedation and munchies are intense (not in a recreational way though)\n\nTrazadone - 2/10\nGood to sleep. That\u2019s about it!\n\nTo do list:\nAyahuasca\nMescaline\n2c-b", "author": "FibonCarbor", "score": 146, "flair": "I :love: Drugs", "created": 1573099655.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/dslqa5/ratings_of_over_40_different_substances/", "num_comments": 75, "title": "Ratings of over 40 different substances", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"f6q5tc2": {"score": 31, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/dslqa5/ratings_of_over_40_different_substances/f6q5tc2/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1573100197.0, "body": "No Mescaline?!?\n\nBest feeling ever, pure peace & balance.\n\n11/10\n\n\ud83c\udf35", "replies": {"f6q6v7m": {"score": 8, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/dslqa5/ratings_of_over_40_different_substances/f6q6v7m/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1573100725.0, "body": "I could do it, I\u2019m just worried about nausea because I\u2019ve heard conflicting results!

After going through opiate addiction it\u2019s not the same. It induced anxiety for the longest time until recently. Now I use every day and it\u2019s nice but not on par with most of the drugs on this list. I do like that there is no physical dependency and no side effects. Definitely the safest drug on this list. \r\n\r\nOxycodone(8/10): I haven\u2019t used this one after developing opiate tolerance but it was nice and potent. I don\u2019t think it would do much for me nowadays. Also very expensive.\r\n\r\nCodeine(2/10): quite trash with any sliver of opiate tolerance. I tried taking 200mg recently and all it did was make my scalp extremely itchy and uncomfortable. I\u2019ve been dependent on Kratom for about two years though so I definitely have a tolerance. Kratom has much more effect.\r\n\r\nEtizolam(10/10 therapeutic 1/10 recreational): a phenomenal tool to have for anxiety, comedowns, bad trips etc. Not recreational in the slightest though. Higher doses just make me feel dull, depressed and disconnected.\r\n\r\nHydrocodone(5/10): with tolerance it takes A LOT and not cost effective at all. I prefer Kratom\r\n\r\nAmphetamine(4/10): Has me feeling good and motivated for about an hour, then I just become extremely irritable.\r\n\r\n4-fa(6/10): quite euphoric but not close to being on par with MDMA. Short acting though. Makes me quite irritable while also feeling good.\r\n\r\n2-fma(5/10): more useful than Amphetamine as a functional stim IMO. Smoother comeup/comedown and not much effect on mood.\r\n\r\n2cb(8/10): Very easy psychedelic. Great for beginners. Hardly any headspace and nice eye candy.\r\n\r\nMDMA(10/10): Pure unadulterated love on tap. High therapeutic and recreational value. Definitely an all time favorite. Any sort of \u2018frequent\u2019 use will fuck your state of being up majorly.\r\n\r\nMXE(9/10): Very high therapeutic and recreational value. Really wish I could\u2019ve experimented more with this one. Better than ketamine for sure. It has more depth to it.\r\n\r\nAlcohol(8/10): as an anxious person this is a great one to open me up although the hangovers are a nightmare. Very socially acceptable though, almost too much so.\r\n\r\nComputer Duster(1/10): it\u2019s basically dumpster nitrous. Extremely dirty \u2018wubwubwub\u2019 effect. I can feel the brain cells dying.\r\n\r\nDXM(7/10): this shit was magic when I was a teenager. Quite dirty though. I had an amazing experience on 300mg dxm and 30mg hydrocodone. It is quite unique compared to other dissos. I used this one very frequently for a period of time. It has very nice after glow but definitely causes some brain-fog. Don\u2019t have much desire to use again. I have fond memories of binging trailer park boys and hell on wheels on 300mg doses though. Also the song Dramamine by Modest mouse was my anthem at the time. That song sounded amazing on DXM. \r\n\r\nPropylhexedrine(4/10): dirty stim buzz with a ton of vasoconstriction. If you get it out of the inhalers then my god they taste HORRIFIC. It does have a bit of euphoria though and definitely has the potential to trigger a 6 hour masturbation session.\r\n\r\nClonazepam(6/10): my favorite benzodiazapine. Has a bit more of a livened mood than Etizolam/Xanax. Still sort of a low recreational value though.\r\n\r\n25c-NBOMe(2/10): took this one before I knew what psychedelics really did. No euphoria, just sort of a headfuck and very minimal visuals. The vasoconstriction was pretty bad. At one point I was afraid my dick was going to fall off.\r\n\r\nNitrous(6/10): if only it lasted longer. Quite expensive for a binge but it\u2019s definitely nice and pairs well with pretty much everything.\r\n\r\nBuspirone(1/10): terrible terrible terrible. Just a dirty anxiolytic. Benzos are much better. DON\u2019T INSUFFLATE THIS. It gave me nasty brain zaps. I was a stupid 16 year old.\r\n\r\nAmbien(2/10): sort of like a more wonky benzo. Not very recreational imo. \r\n\r\nSynthetic Cannabinoids(5/10): I\u2019m not sure the exact compounds. I used a blend back around 2015. I enjoyed it but it was pretty dirty. I never got the intense hallucinogenic effects that some describe. It was very similar to cannabis.\r\n\r\nPhenibut(9/10): Very nice mood booster, anxiety reducer and social lubricant. Also pair well with most everything. Super prone to dependency though and has quite a comedown for me even at low doses. I can count on being pretty depressed on the 2nd day after dosing.\r\n\r\nAlprazolam: about the same as Etizolam\r\n\r\nDMT: this one frightens me and I doesn\u2019t have much of a draw towards recreational use at all. This is strictly a tool imo.\r\n\r\nHeroin(10/10): Beautiful but I definitely had a problem with this one. It\u2019s the perfect escape. Numb to everything. I swear my whole family could\u2019ve died and all it would take is a shot and everything is just fine. Addiction has intense negative social impact. I isolated and ignored my issues for about 2 years. It leads you into a stagnant haze.\r\n\r\nLSD(5/10): I\u2019d have to try this one again. I had a bad first experience in which I smoked way too much pot on the comeup and lost most of my ability to comprehend/communicate. This was not good as an already socially anxious person in a social setting. I would like to try again though as I am more comfortable nowadays.\r\n\r\nKratom(9/10): saved me from heroin addiction but Kratom dependency is also a pain in the ass. I dose every 4 hours and interdose anxiety/depression is terrible. My mood is pretty much completely dependent on whether not I have dosed recently. Great mood boost and pro-social effects though. Reduces anxiety and calms but can also Amp you up a bit depending on strain/setting.\r\n\r\n3-Meo-PCP(6/10?): this one is very hard for me to recall. I think I used only about 100mg of this in total spread across different days. I would like to try it again. I did feel a bit of mania which I liked.\r\n\r\nFuranylFentanyl(4/10): the fentalogues have potent opiod effect but very low euphoria IME. Also very short acting. I couldn\u2019t imagine being dependent on them. Seems like a nightmare\r\n\r\nButyrFentanyl(4/10): same as FuranylFentanyl.\r\n\r\nU47700(6/10): more euphoric by quite a bit but also extremely short acting. Also very caustic.\r\n\r\nBuprenorphan(3/10): Good tool for addicts but hardly any recreational value. Takes away most of the physical withdrawals but I still have major cravings. Kratom does a much better job of keeping me clean.\r\n\r\nMethamphetamine(5/10): Used this one for quite a bit. I was mainly drawn to the pipe. Once I realized this was the case I smashed mine and never bought another. I had no issue quitting after that. If you can stick to oral dosing though it\u2019s basically Adderall on steroids. Much longer lasting and smoother come down. I never really experienced the intense euphoria people describe. Just got twacked and paranoid on many occasions.\r\n\r\nTianeptine(3/10): this shit is the devil. Do NOT IV. This is the crack of opiates. Pretty intense rush but less than 30 minutes later and you're mixing another shot. My tolerance rose 3x fold in one day. I used 500mg the first day then 1.5g the next before my 2g was gone. Never bought more because I realized just how dangerous this one could be. I believe this is literally this worst thing you could be dependent on. I hear it also destroys your opiate tolerance to the point where even methadone and fentanyl doesn\u2019t put a dent in WD. It's also extremely caustic and I highly regret putting this in my veins.\r\n\r\nButane(2/10): dirty nitrous like buzz\r\n\r\n2-Methyl-2-Butanol(2/10): extremely dirty benzo-like buzz. Purchased as a potential alcohol replacement while drug/alcohol testing. Tasted absolutely horrible and had some weird side effects such as frequent urination at night and sore/enlarged nipples. Here\u2019s is an in depth post on my experience: https://www.reddit.com/r/drugs/comments/amodap\r\n\r\n1,4-Butanediol(7/10): Very euphoric and has INSANE aphrodisiac properties. It\u2019s very recreational but frequent use lead to my first ever panic attack and fucked up my anxiety for months after. Do not use this one frequently. After a 3 day binge I was paranoid and extremely anxious. This one seems to induce benzo WD like symptoms after a very short period of use. Also fucked up my sleep majorly.\r\n\r\nTramadol(2/10): doesn\u2019t do much at all for opioid tolerant people\r\n\r\nGabapentin(8/10): this is a great tool. I used it mainly for easing heroin WD. The first time I used it in this manner it was a God send. I slept like a baby and felt no WD at all. The second time I had an emotional break down in which I came to the realization of what I was doing to myself with heroin. I had just started IV\u2019ing a week or two prior. I broke down on the floor crying. I was an emotional wreck. This seems to have sort of a psychedelic quality imo. I could see it being quite recreational when not going through WD.\r\n\r\nMethadone(8/10): pretty much pharma heroin. Less euphoria though. If you\u2019re actually trying to escape the life of opiate addiction I think suboxone is much better. Methadone still gets you high af. It\u2019s a full opioid agonist just like heroin and scratches the same itch. The main difference is it gets you away from the needle and you don\u2019t have to worry about where your next fix is coming from. \r\n\r\nKetamine(9/10): I love this one. Quite recreational with no physical dependency potential. Great positive effects on anxiety and depression. I find it hard to describe but it\u2019s sort of like a serene, disconnected alcohol like buzz. Very calming. I have yet to experience the 'hole'.\r\n\r\nKava(6/10): nice alcohol replacement. Has a sort of stoning quality to it. No hangover or WD. Eases anxiety and lifts mood quite nicely.\r\n\r\n4-aco-met(10/10): my favorite psychedelic. Nice euphoria. MDMA-like entactogenic effects. Eye candy visuals and hardly any mind fuck although my highest dose was only 15mg. Buddy took 20mg though and LOVED IT.\r\n\r\n2-fdck(8/10): Very very similar to ketamine but it lacks something.", "author": "Exa8yte", "score": 254, "flair": "Long Post", "created": 1596617066.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/i3viw4/44_drugs_ive_used_and_my_reviews_on_them/", "num_comments": 74, "title": "44 drugs I've used and my reviews on them", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"g0eakqg": {"score": 103, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/i3viw4/44_drugs_ive_used_and_my_reviews_on_them/g0eakqg/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1596618098.0, "body": "All this drugs and no psilocybin?", "replies": {"g0ec2f4": {"score": 41, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/i3viw4/44_drugs_ive_used_and_my_reviews_on_them/g0ec2f4/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1596618984.0, "body": "Yeah, I guess for the longest time RC tryptamines were easier to get and also far cheaper.

Soon you'll be able to write a novel lol.  But srsly, this is a pretty solid subjective general description of the drugs you've tried and I can find a lot of the experiences very relatable.  Otherwise, stay strong in this period of opioid addiction you're going through.  It's a good thing you didn't delve deeper into the tianeptine/fent experience.  That stuff is truly scary in regards to it's addictive and dependence forming potential.  I agree that fent is oddly non-euphoric, although still more sedating than most opes in the classic opioid fashion.  Some people however strongly disagree and get hooked, and when it comes time to quit, it can be a hell like no other.  Good you dodged that bullet.  As for tianeptine, if they're leaving it legal, they really may as well make hydro, tramadol, codeine, etc legal.  I'm all for the decriminalization and potential legalization of drugs, but it's hard to deny that tianeptine in such an odd-ball with regards to it's legal status in a lot of places.  If you are currently working on getting off kratom, whether you try to taper or go balls to the wall cold turkey, good luck.  Kratom withdrawals can be a real clusterfuck.  Personally, I actually used bupe to taper off and had much more success with that.  It unfortunately really isn't the walk in the park it's frequently made out to be once you get to the high doses it sounds like your on.  Regardless, don't shy away from recovery if you get to the point that you decide you're done with life on opes.\n\nOne more thing I'd like to add is that propylhexedrine can be a really interesting drug if you decide to do an acid base extraction with it.  It's kinda at a disadvantage when comparing it to other drugs if you're just putting the cotton in OJ or something or just eating it straight because of just how fucking nasty it can be.  Propylhexedrine HCl when taken routes other than orally (NOT IV!!!  IV PROPYLHEXEDRINE CAN KILL) imo seems to be absorbed much better and come with much more pleasant effects.  When smoked, it's actually an interestingly chill stim high you wouldn't expect from propylhexedrine considering how adrenergic and intense it feels taken orally.  There's definitely a lot less vasoconstriction, and you need very little to go a long way.  It also really made me really wanna redose smoked.  I did bing it for a while which was a bad idea because the cardiac effects became increasingly apparent with each consecutive dose and it's pleasant effects became less and less apparent very quickly.  Smoked, it personally kinda feels like a mix of Ritalin and a little bit of dxm.  It's really a high of its own.", "replies": {"g8khnsw": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/i3viw4/44_drugs_ive_used_and_my_reviews_on_them/g8khnsw/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1602512012.0, "body": "The highest I've gone regarding Kratom use is ~20gpd.

I subconsciously started dosing more frequently simply in response to interdose withdrawal symptoms (anxiety, racing thoughts, fatigue, yawning, nausea, sweats, and sniffles) and making a concrete dosing schedule to stick to each day was difficult.  I was able to get bupe from an addiction specialist even though I was just taking kratom.  I may have gotten lucky, but it seems like more and more specialists are becoming aware of kratom addiction.  They waited for me first to go into withdrawals and gave me clonidine before letting me have sub even though it seems that people don't generally require a induction period during the switch from kratom to bupe.  I was with my mom at the time, and when she called and discussed my symptoms, they gave me 4mg and told me to take two mg every two hours until I felt comfortable.  It sounds like you already have some experience with sub so you probably have a vague idea how to dose.  For example, I took 8, and frankly that was quite high. I also had a pretty large habit compared to what you got going on at this point.  You could probably get away with 2mg or so at this point (try 1-1.5mg first).  \n\nThe interdose withdrawal with sub tapering is definitely noticeable, but not nearly as intense or sudden ime, and that frankly made a big difference along with the fact that I really didn't need to schedule doses (just took one in the morning and one in the evening).  Overall I had some crankiness, fatigue, mild hot flashes, sniffles, yawns, stretching, tummy troubles, etc but it was generally very mild.  Even though I would say the physical withdrawals from sub are definitely less severe that physical withdrawals from other opes, I would say they can be overall a little bit more prominent than with kratom, but it was definitely less intense psychologically.  I actually got overall pretty sleepy while tapering, although at the start of my taper I unsurprisingly had some sleeping troubles.  Regardless of what you're tapering with, you can expect that.  With tapering sub, you gotta go slow because of how long it takes for sub to leave your system.  I did a 25-33% dose reduction every 3 weeks to a month, which was definitely enough time to recover.\n\nSorry these are so damn long.  Good luck man.

Same mom different dads. Growing up, we were inseparable. It didn\u2019t matter that we didn\u2019t share the same dad and grandparents; everyone loved us anyways. Him especially.\n\nHe always had a way of making people laugh, whether it was from telling jokes, doing dumb shit and hurting himself, or playing pranks on people. I was the butt of many pranks over 15 years, ranging from ice in my underwear to lotion in my pillow at night to truly believing I was adopted (why do big brothers always do that lol). \n\nHe was the first male in the family to graduate high school with good grades. My mom was the first to graduate in the family ever, while pregnant with my brother. Growing up in a Native family, there\u2019s a lot of familial structures and expectations, so it was important to go to school but if there\u2019s shit going on with the family then you dropped out to help. My brother was the first to have a specialized degree and was looking to go to automotive school after getting his associates.\n\nA lot of shit happened to us as a family. Generations of alcoholism and drug abuse were pretty easy to see; a couple uncles were always in and out of jail for public intoxication, fighting cops, shit like that. My bio dad was always on me about school and college and to always stay away from that stuff so I did (for the most part). My brother didn\u2019t get the same treatment; when he was little, my bio dad stepped up to raise him after his dad left when my mom first got pregnant, but my bio dad had a lot of deep seeded issues and would later on say my brother wasn\u2019t his son. This hurt my brother a lot but I know he never said anything about it. My mom met my stepdad when I was 5 and my brother 7, and not too long after my mom split from my bio dad to be with my stepdad. It was tough all around, wondering why my parents split, wondering if it was our faults, why we had to be secretive about what we did with one parent to another.\n\nWe went through a lot of loss and other tribulations as a family. My mom would eventually be diagnosed with fibromyalgia, chronic migraines, and rheumatoid arthritis, and was prescribed hydrocodone (lortab) 20\u2019s. The pain conditions ended up being genetic as my brother and I started having chronic migraines in middle/high school. We would take ibuprofen 800mg, Tylenol 500mg, and even got to a point where we would take half of a lortab to curb the pain. Long story short, my brother started asking my mom for a little more cause it wasn\u2019t enough and it turned into him stealing them, either to use or to sell. My parents figured it out and confronted him twice over the course of a year. He slowly kept at it throughout high school, enough to get by but not enough that my mom would notice.\n\nEventually when he graduated high school, he started community college and I started to notice major changes in him. I was still in tenth grade so I was busy with my own schoolwork, but he always seemed tired. Drained. Irritable. And he had grey twinges to his skin. I didn\u2019t think much of it, everyone said college is tough so I assumed it was just that.. Until I was looking for my headphones in his jacket pockets and found a straw made from a pen and a lighter. I didn\u2019t see any residue and I usually wasn\u2019t supposed to go through his stuff so I didn\u2019t say anything. A week later, I found crumbled up foil behind the toilet in the bathroom we shared. I still didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nCut to this weekend, eight years ago. Thursday night, the 4th, I was texting him about borrowing some clothes for a dress up day at school Friday. He said go ahead. I said thanks and have fun hunting with grandpa. He said thanks and love you. I said love you too. I went to bed, woke up Friday morning, started getting ready for school when I heard my mom hysterically sobbing and screaming on the ground. I went to see what was going on and my stepdad calmly tells me to give them a minute and he\u2019ll come get me soon. I sat on the couch and he comes down, crying, telling me that my brother passed away. My grandma found him dead on the sofa, in a puddle of his own vomit, skin was grey and blue, already gone. Later on in the toxicology report, we saw he had heroin, methadone, and something else in his system. I burst into tears hysterically as my mom came down and hugged me. She and my stepdad had to leave to the hospital where they took my brother. I had to call my bio dad and my brother\u2019s best friend. I\u2019ll never forget hearing the way they couldn\u2019t believe it then just start crying..\n\nIt\u2019s been eight years today. For eight years, I grieved the loss of my very first best friend. For eight years, I wondered why I was still here and he wasn\u2019t. For years, I blamed myself for not saying anything. Speaking up sooner about what I saw. So what if he got mad, he might\u2019ve still been here. But through therapy, I\u2019m realizing that it wasn\u2019t my fault. He was so troubled and had so many demons he didn\u2019t want to share with the world, because this society insists that men don\u2019t feel emotions. They\u2019re supposed to bury it and keep working and to never show weakness. I can\u2019t help but think, if we were more compassionate and understanding as a society, if we encouraged healthy coping behaviors instead of dismissing uncomfortable feelings, that things would have played out differently. \n\nI can\u2019t change the past. I really don\u2019t know why I\u2019m writing this, for catharsis I guess. But I guess what I\u2019m trying to say, is to show more kindness to those around you. Think about why you do what you do, whatever it is, and to be honest with yourself and do it with an intention. Remember this is your one life, and you usually don\u2019t get second chances. \n\nMuch love to all of you, thanks for being a great community to come together and share these stories. \ud83d\udc9a\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t expect this to get as much attention as it did but thanks for the awards!

I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.\n\nI wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.\n\nAs for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\n\nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.\n\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.\u201c", "replies": {"g7vnui3": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/j5jmku/its_been_eight_years_since_my_brother_overdosed/g7vnui3/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1602004102.0, "body": "That\u2019s beautiful.", "replies": {}}}}}}}}}}, "g7souiv": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/j5jmku/its_been_eight_years_since_my_brother_overdosed/g7souiv/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1601940620.0, "body": "Wishing you and your family all the best! \ud83d\udc9a", "replies": {"g7sp4dc": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/j5jmku/its_been_eight_years_since_my_brother_overdosed/g7sp4dc/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1601940762.0, "body": "Thank you!

I read about how certain psychedelics can help heal trauma like PTSD, depression, and anxiety, and also how they can help reset the receptors in your brain so that you no longer have cravings or the desire to use slave drugs again. For me it worked tremendously. I started with an ayahuasca session and that really showed me the path I needed to take to achieve the peace of mind I was looking for. Psychedelics aren't for everyone, but for some people it can really help clear all the fog and show them exactly what they need to do to make their lives better.

Note that I have been prescribed Seconal (one of the most addictive drugs) in the past and stopped it without a second thought. I also have no addictions and I am 49 years old.\n\nUsed to think I had chronic kidney stones so I went to the ER frequently. Often there was a stone but sometimes there wasn\u2019t. I had always assumed I simply passed it.\n\nIn 2014 I had severe pain and visited a urologist who did a CAT or MRI and found no stones and send me to a spine pain specialist. As it turns out I had broken my back when I was much younger - maybe 14-15 years old (see image). Of course, I didn\u2019t know that at the time but I did have a significant fall.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/tAcn69B.jpg\n\nI was treated with cortisone shots in my spine and the pain vanished within a day or two. That lasted about four years which I\u2019m told is considered a great outcome.\n\nOver the last couple of years this pain has been increasing. I had more cortisone shots about a year ago. Those helped for about two weeks and since that time it has only grown worse.\n\nAt this point I have to stay in bed for 2-3 days in order to be more mobile for a day without massive pain. As a result I have gained a lot of weight (up to 400 lbs), so exercise has become more difficult. Walking almost any distance is painful. Sitting upright for long periods of time is painful. I am doing intermittent fasting combined with Keto to help weight loss but there is only so much that can do with such inactivity.\n\nThe spine pain specialist told me that medications will not help with the exception of these cortisone pills which I can only take twice a year. I believe he may be right as at one time I did try taking Hydrocodone and there was absolutely no discernible difference in the pain.\n\nSO MY QUESTION is:\n\nDoes anyone know of anything that may be much stronger that could help me be more mobile to the point where I can lose enough weight in order to qualify for spinal surgery? I know nothing about OxiContin or Fentanyl. I\u2019m considering seeking help from a pain control doctor of some kind, but if there is likely nothing that can treat my pain to some degree I won\u2019t bother.\n\nI really need some guidance here. I\u2019m concerned that I may end up with a pain specialist who is more of a pill mill. I need help, not a high. In fact, I think the only time I have ever experience anything like that was at the ER with huge doses of morphine and I\u2019m not interested in a feeling other than NOT HURTING when I need to be more active. \n\nAny advice or thoughts are appreciated.

I have struggled with depression during many of my teenage years, and that has influenced a lot of my decisions. As such, I began using drugs early and have used drugs for all of my teenage years, first smoking weed when I was 13. I have used all types of drugs occasionally (weed, MDMA, amphetamine, methamphetamine, heroin, oxycodone, hydrocodone, Ambien, LSD, mushrooms, and many more) for years. This post is not me begging anyone not to do drugs, nor to do them. I believe in strongly in civil liberty and the right to do as one wishes as long as they don't harm others.\n\nI have not smoked weed regularly in more than a year, and not at all in the past 6+ months.\n\nBut out of all the drugs I've done, I have had the most trouble with the drug often touted as the most harmless out of any of these: weed. It has been the bane of my existence these last couple years, and it all in all has destroyed much of who I am as a person. But before you run to comment and disagree with me, let me explain, and once again reiterate that I think anyone can do drugs safely - in moderation. And it is with weed that most struggle with moderation; I know that many smoke weed every single day, including teenagers. For the common adult, I can't speak of the risk you're taking, but for adolescents, I can: you are destroying your reward system and the symptoms very well may last into adulthood, as mine have.\n\nFor over a year, I smoked weed every day. During my sophomore and junior years, I essentially lived and breathed weed. The longer I smoked, the more I indulged. I didn't see it as a problem because I figured that it couldn't harm me permanently. I began smoking many times a day, as much as I could. Over the summer between my sophomore and junior year, it was all I did. I essentially had no social interaction apart from what took place with my immediate family. I began to notice my social skills declining significantly, as well as my ability to concentrate or focus on anything at all. This persisted and continued to get worse over time, and eventually every time I smoked weed it got really bad. (I must note that many other drugs began to have a similar effect on me - alcohol, amphetamine, caffeine, opioids stopped working altogether. It's not nearly as bad as weed, but I lose the ability to focus and am ridden with anxiety. This is important because these drugs are primarily dopaminergic, but drugs that are primarily serotonergic affect me almost normally, notable examples being MDMA, meth to a degree, and psilocybin mushrooms). I would be useless for the duration of the rest of the day after I smoked any amount, even the tiniest of nugs, and I would feel depressed for a couple days after. I opted to quit because it was taking a toll on me and was no longer enjoyable. I stopped smoking altogether except for a few outlying situations a few months after the school year began. And that should have been the end of it - at least the beginning of the end.\n\nBut it wasn't. Fast forward to more than a calendar year later, and I still have these issues. They have eaten me alive. I cannot focus on anything at school, my memory is terrible, I have bad anxiety, I can barely hold a conversation, my emotions are numbed/nonexistent, I'm tired absolutely all day no matter how much sleep I get, and I essentially have an inability to feel anything at all (emotionally - including being happy, sad, scared, etc). I have tried several things to counteract this, the only one remotely successful being exercise. It has caused me many, many problems, particularly regarding schoolwork. I'm not used to struggling with school or anything academic; I'm not bragging, but to exemplify the drastic change, I have a 34 on the ACT and I'm a national merit (semi)finalist. I have lost almost all of my friends due to my social ineptitude and difficulty communicating, despite me trying extremely hard to keep myself normal. I have failed.\n\nAnd it was yesterday that I realized why. I was contemplating why LSD was not very fun for me compared to other people and doing a bit of research, and someone had said that it was significantly more dopaminergic than mushrooms, which I enjoy far more than LSD. It prompted me to Google the symptoms of [dopamine deficiency](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/4z74as/low_dopamine_symptoms/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) - and I have almost every single one of them (you can Google for sources that aren't Reddit, just search \"dopamine deficiency\"). The difficulty concentrating, the difficulty maintaining eye contact, the constipation and other GI issues, the difficulty learning - it all makes complete perfect sense. It is a perfect account of everything that ails me. \n\nIn addition to this, I found a study that researches the problems mice have when repeatedly exposed to THC in adolescence. It damages their GABA system, which significantly lessens production of it which persists into adulthood, despite the discontinuance of the administration of THC.  [Article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3930618/)\n\nBased on what I've read, the GABA system functioning correctly is crucial to dopamine production and the dopamine system functioning normally. So, through screwing up the GABA system, so have the dopamine pathways/production been significantly affected.\n\nHowever, concurrent research has shown that, in mice, the effects of chronic exposure of THC in adolescence can be reversed through artificial stimulation of the GABA system, notably through the GABA-A agonist muscimol [source](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912134809.htm). I am going to try to use supplements to increase my natural GABA and dopamine production in an attempt to reverse the symptoms that have plagued me for so long. If this fails, I may have to resort to artificially stimulating my GABA-A receptors - but I hope it doesn't come to that.\n\nI have done some research on increasing natural GABA production so far, and the best thing I've come up with is a combination of B6 vitamins, glutamine, and taurine. This may be incomplete/incorrect as I haven't had time to research it more, but I will continue to look into it more. I will find ways to increase natural dopamine production and try that as well. \n\nI intend for this post to be a warning to young teenagers not to make the mistake I did. I should have been more productive, I should have made better decisions; I am a smart person, but my confidence in my own decision-making skills has been my downfall. \n\nIn addition to acting as a warning, I implore that all who see this to offer any knowledge they may have on the subject of supplements I could use to balance my GABA and dopamine systems - it would be greatly appreciated. On a day-to-day basis, I'm miserable. I have so much trouble just completing daily tasks and I wish nothing more than to be normal again. \n\nThank you for the read.\n\n\nEdit: After much research, I have come up with a complete list of supplements.\nThey include: B vitamins (particularly B6), glutamine, taurine, L-theanine, L-dopa, and L-tyrosine. It is important that all of these be taken together, at least the first three to four. The latter two can be taken independently as they affect primarily dopamine, but the first four taken individually could upset the glutamate/GABA balance.  [This](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.jacobsladdercenter.com/doc/research/other/How-to-Increase-GABA-and-Balance-Glutamate.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwiDnNmLnJXnAhWXB80KHZdFA7MQFjANegQIAxAB&usg=AOvVaw1LppPRUPIHS8YzrYIZ4e-A) is a great resource pertaining to glutamate/GABA balance and is what my list of GABA supplements is based on.\n\nI have also taken the liberty of creating an [Amazon shopping list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3D4DGOSML9SQU?ref_=wl_share) with all the supplements for $50 and some change, if anybody else wants to try it with me.", "author": "Bhamilton0347", "score": 62, "flair": "Harm Reduction", "created": 1579669201.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/es0yjy/why_you_shouldnt_smoke_weed_as_a_kid_adolescent/", "num_comments": 48, "title": "Why You Shouldn't Smoke Weed As a Kid / Adolescent", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"ff757t8": {"score": 24, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/es0yjy/why_you_shouldnt_smoke_weed_as_a_kid_adolescent/ff757t8/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1579670161.0, "body": "Well said.

This allows you to get a feel for how the substance is potentiated and reduces the possibility of overdose. Please comment any additional potentiators you may have found or that I missed.\n\nLSD/LSA potentiation:\n- Noopept: potentiates LSD by about 3 times according to myself and many others anecdotal experience (can cause some anxiety for some)\n- Coluracetam: strong potentiator of lysergamides, coluracetam appears to have potentiation effects on psychs and dissos comparable to that of noopept, which suggests (along with the fact that coluracetam increases acetylcholine production) that coluracetam may be more similar to noopept than any racetams\n- Piracetam: potentiates LSD by about 1.5 times\n- Fasoracetam: minimal testing done on this combo but it appears to potentiate lsd by about 2 times\n- note: Aniracetam appears to be the one racetam that significantly dulls psychedelics. interesting; aniracetam appears to be a 5HT2A agonist but weakens LSD significantly in terms of both euphoria and visuals (i got none when i mixed 100 ug lsd w a normal dose of ani), so this suggests aniracetam takes up receptor space thereby preventing LSD from binding to 5HT2A or perhaps ani decreases binding affinity to 5HT2A. In theory one would think other substances agonizing 5HT2A would potentiate psychedelics but aniracetam does the opposite, at least at normal doses. This raises the question; what would happen if a tiny dose of aniracetam was taken prior to LSD? would it potentiate or would it still weaken it hmmmm. Subjectively, independent of psychedelic combinations; aniracetam produces effects similar to psychedelics or MDMA only much more mild for many people.\u00a0\n\nAmphetamine potentiation:\n- 1/4 tsp baking soda or tums 30 minutes before dosing (acidity increases excretion of amphetamines and decreases length of high as well as worsens comedown)\n- low dose memantine (5-20 mg)\n- low dose dxm (30-90 mg; more is hard on the heart)\u00a0\n- Racetams: unpredictable potentiation, can cause anger or too much stimulation for some. Mixing racetams and amphetamines could also potentially cause glutamate excitoxicty, so i dont recommend mixing them (if you do mix them, take creatine and/or CDP fholine and low dose memantine with it because those aid with glutamate excitoxicity. note: creatine is more effective for reducing glutamate excitoxicity)\n- Agmatine\n\nOpiate potentiation:\n- 30-120 mg DXM 30-60 minutes before dosing\n- 5-20 mg memantine 3-4 hrs before dosing\n- 25-50 mg DPH, hydroxyzine, or promethazine 30-60 minutes before dosing\n- Agmatine\n- Tagamet/cimetidine 30-60 minutes before dosing, inhibits liver enzymes\n- Grapefruit juice or grapefruit seed extract for liver enzyme inhibition\n- Turmeric and black pepper: enzyme inhibition\u00a0\n- For fat soluble opis (kratom, hydrocodone, codeine, tramadol ): fatty snack or drink 20-30 minutes after dosing\n*Tramadol: Start with either 50 or 100 mg, and redose 50 mg every 30 minutes after initial dose for maximum high, fatty snack 20-30 minutes after first tramadol dose here helps tremendously with the increase in absorption. Stagger 50 mg redoses every 30 minutes up to 300 mg tramadol total.\n*Kratom: all the above applies, in addition, Chinese cats claw has shared alkaloids with kratom and potentiates it through that. DL-phenylalanine/mucuna puriens extract also boosts kratom due to the dopaminergic aspect of kratom. \n\nDXM potentiation:\n- grapefruit juice or grapefruit seed extract for liver enzyme inhibition\u00a0\n- Lysine (amino acid): appears to potentiate DXM anecdotally and subjectively, this would likely be due to lysine effect on glutamate production.\n- Noopept: increases DXM visuals and improves cognition while on DXM and allows for increased trip memory retainment (appears to apply to coluracetam as well)\n- 25-100 mg DPH for liver enzyme inhibition and visual potentiation (can make DXM feel too dirty for some)\n- Agmatine\u00a0\n\nCannabis potentiation:\n- External sources of terpenes from plants and herbs (lemongrass for myrcene, thyme for thymol)\n- External sources of cannabinoids including nutmeg, kava, dark chocolate, and ceylon cinnamon\n- Agmatine\n- Kanna\n\n\nPhenibut and gabapentin (possibly pregablin/lyrica as well):\n- Acidic substances consumed while dosing (coffee, lemo/lime jucie in water, etc)\n- Fatty snack consumed 15-30 minutes after dosing\u00a0\n- Staggering doses appears to increse the efffects of both of these substances; split phenibut dose in half and dose each half with on hour seperating the doses.

Never tried noopept but have frequent experience using LSD (100-750ug, higher parts due to dosing in a short time after a previous trip so tolerance was considered) so I have a rough idea of what I'll experience at specific dosage ranges. For example at 100-200ug I'd say is a pretty standard trip with archetypal experiences at times, sporadic movement through time (sometimes controllable), visuals that can change the environment, music enhancement and sensations leading to euphoric dancing, and of course heightened levels of awareness and ways of thinking/connecting concepts. 300ug I'd say it gets me deeper into the functionality of reality and my perception. This can lead to understanding new things about dimensions and changes in visuals increasing the realness and vividness. This and upwards tends to last quite a bit after dosing with residual visual changes and lasting effects for up to two days after tripping especially with sleep deprivation. At 500ug, my most memorable one due to using on the comedown of oral meth and sleep deprivation taking it at 2am, my entire perspective of reality had shifted like half my body was in this \"dimension\" and half of it was *inside* reality and sorta \"coming out\" of it (like a sheet/fabric of reality that I was coming out from, like think when pressing your face outwards from inside your shirt or a blanket except I was the blanket and the thing pushing out). At this point sensations internally and externally were pretty indistinguishable and made me feel sick to my stomach because everything I saw I could taste (or more accurately feel with my tastebuds/mouth/throat, not really \"taste\" per se), smell, and feel as it being inside of me and outside of me. Music became entirely encompassing making me become part of it, changing my visuals both OEV and CEV (CEVs being mainly shapes, colors, blotches, and movement where I'd sorta begin automatically starting to move along with it and feel like I'm \"falling into it\" when my eyes are closed leading to the inability to sleep or even rest), my emotions became extremely dramatic and would sorta spiral/fractal into the very feeling of one of them (mainly discomfort, sadness, where crying felt almost like having an orgasm but of the eyes/head/face), and kept feeling this sensation of growing and shrinking like going from one infinite point to the next just bouncing back and forth. And my visuals kept having bits of it swirling around making me feel gross. So I want to know how does noopept potentiate it exactly? Does it make smaller doses just feel like larger doses including duration and overall trippiness? Or does it sorta bring down some of the higher dose effects to a smaller dose? Or does it just increase the overall trippiness in some other manner?", "replies": {"fepdgin": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/eq41n6/the_ultimate_potentiation_guide/fepdgin/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1579346601.0, "body": "Noopept potentiates all aspects of LSD and LSA, increase in visuals and euphoria.

Not my first choice, but it's societies drug of choice, and I'm actually okay with that. It's a good time until its not though. If done wrong the experience can quickly go from a 7/10 to a 2/10.\n\nWeed: 9/10 - Probably the best drug out there from an objective standpoint. Even compared to a lot more dangerous drugs the high feels pretty fucking good. Also it's super versatile. You can do it everyday, it mixes well (and safely) with pretty much everything else, and its good for sleep as well as energy. Not much to say that hasn't been said. Only problem is the smell, which can be avoided with edibles or a pen.\n\nDXM: 9/10 - Kinda my thing. I'm honestly lost as to why people hate this drug so much. A lot of my favorite drug experiences involved DXM. Probably has my favorite closed eye visuals of any drug. Also the music enhancement is fucking wild. I used to get a lot more bad side effects like nausea, hangovers, itching, etc. but a lot of that stuff has kind of stopped happening after doing it a lot.\n\nMemantine: 5/10 - Interesting thing to try, but ultimately not that great. It's definitely dissociating, but not in a particularly euphoric way. It's almost like being sober, except that everything is kind of confusing and alien. I've never really gotten great visuals from it. The worst part is the 24+ hour duration. It's a decent condiment to drugs like acid, DXM or weed, but ultimately probably not worth it. It does work well for depression in therapeutic doses though.\n\nPhenibut: 6/10 - I have kind of a love/hate relationship with phenibut. To me it feels like if benzos and adderall had a child, which is a fucking awesome feeling. Great for socializing, great for working, great for sleep, great for exercise, great for just chilling. Also a very good condiment type drug. There are a myriad of catches though. It causes tolerance, dependence and hellish withdrawals pretty quickly, it can be hard on the stomach, higher doses can quickly go from euphoric to very shitty, and it always makes me sleep if I'm even slightly tired.LSD: 8/10 - Acid is a classic for a reason. I've done it a lot and had nothing but beautiful experiences, but have yet to have any breakthough life changing moments like I do with DXM. I do think it's changed how I see the world and how I am as a person, but its not like it showed me all the secrets to life or anything.\n\nShrooms: 8/10 - I only did them once, but it was definitely on par with acid. The visuals were definitely a lot more crazy, like, after smoking some weed I could barely see my feet on the ground. I could see them dethroning acid as my favorite psych if I did them some more.\n\nOxycodone, Hydrocodone, Tramadol: 7/10 - It feels so cozy, warm blanket, all your problems melt away, blah blah blah. There's not much to say about opiates really. I like them every once in a while, but they kinda just turn me into a lazy piece of shit. \n\nKratom: 7/10 - Basically a functional opiate. Doesn't feel quite as great, but pairs very nicely with some weed or phenibut. Just generally a lot more versatile than other opiates. \n\nXanax: 4/10 - One of the most overrated drugs imo. It feels good while its happening, but it's not so great when you wake up at 3pm in a puddle of drool with an empty fridge, empty pockets, and no memory of where it all went. It can really bring out the worst in people. \n\nAdderall: 7/10 - Good balance between recreational and functional value on its own, but kinda edgy and uncomfortable and a shitty comedown. I almost exclusively use it with phenibut though, which rounds off some of addys negatives. The combo is 9/10, It makes me feel almost superhuman. \n\nVyvanse: 6/10 - The same drug as adderall, but a lot less recreational. It's better for work imo cause it lasts pretty much all day, but it doesn't have much of the euphoric rushy element that makes addy fun. Also the crash is a lot worse in my opinion since it lasts a really long time.\n\nRitalin: 4/10 - Like addy, but with all the discomfort and dirty tweaky feelings ramped up, a shorter duration and a worse crash. \n\nPEA: 4/10 - What I'd imagine crack is like. It's super intensely speedy for like 15 minutes, then after the comedown I fall asleep pretty much immediately every time. More of an interesting thing to have than something I actually enjoy doing a lot. \n\nCaffeine: 6/10 - Purely functional, but it performs its function very well. Also a good condiment. \n\nNicotine: 5/10 - Pretty fucking lame on its own, but again a good condiment. \n\nNitrous: 6/10 - Like two minutes in psychedelic heaven. The king of condiments. \n\nDPH: 1/10 - Shit tier drug. I have no clue why I thought it'd be a good idea to try tripping on it.\n\nHydroxyzine: 5/10 - Basically like DPH, but better in every way. Also it doesn't cause a nightmare trip if you take too much. \n\nClonidine: 5/10 - Basically a knock out pill. It is pretty intoxicating, but not in a way that's really fun or interesting.

At age 12 I found a bottle of vicodin in my parents cabinet. I was hooked from right then and there. By 13, at the end of my freshman year of high school, I was a full blown addict with opiates. By 14, I discovered adderall and tramadol. This was my sophomore year. Every day before school started I'd take roughly 12-15 10mg hydros, two 20mg addys when I got to school and roughly 400mg of tramadol before 2nd period. Halfway through, I graduated to fentanyl and oxycontin in place of my hydrocodone/vicodin. No less than 160mg of oxys or roxis, and if I could find fentanyl I'd usually get the sucker things or just suck the gel out of the patches. This continued, every day, throughout my entire time in high school, an addict to multiple substances. \n     By 15 I shot up heroin for the first time, it was lovely, but for whatever reason I never got into it heavily. By the time I was 18, I've done everything there was to do. But for many years, opiates were my true love. By 22, I was using no less than 200mg of oxy/roxi per day, with the occasional 80mg of adderall here and there to feel extra sweet. By 24, I discovered my love for benzos. Mind you, I was still using opiates heavily and by this time I was also using heavy doses of Xanax and K-pins. When I say heavy, I mean 8-10 bars in one handful. Somehow, I was lucky to never have OD'd all but one time but I was wittingly courting death as I was convinced nothing could kill me. January of this year I decided to try a suboxone program for my opiate use, 24mg a day and it worked alright for me. But I couldn't stop the zans, and picked up a meth binging habit. \n     Fast forward to the end of April, I beat up my step dad for no reason during a black out. I went to jail, blacked out, bailed myself out, blacked out, walked home, still blacked out, fought my step dad again, ate the remaining 9 bars I had (according to my mom) and tried fighting the police when they came to take me back to jail. Fast forward to now. I'm 26, just celebrated my first birthday sober since I was 11yrs old. I'm facing 9 months in prison, thankfully because of covid I was only locked up for just shy of a month. I nearly died in jail from the benzo withdrawal. It was horrible. When I got bailed out at the end of May, it took no less than an hour for me to accept that it's time to change. I signed myself in to a PHP program which lasted until the middle of June, graduated and am now doing IOP. Which I'm on track to graduate from next week, on the mark of two months sober for me. The longest stint of sobriety in my whole life.\n     I don't know why I decided to write this, and for the sake of time I've skipped some incredible details. But maybe it can inspire someone. Nothing about this is easy, but if you find a reason to live it makes it worth it. For me, that reason is my little sister and my girlfriend who I absolutely adore. She's a fucking Saint, and I'm blessed that she's been there for me during the last 4 months, the hardest 4 months, of my life. This community is great.

The hydros didn't help with any pain so I just took the Tylenol and iced ALOT.

I learned how to eat and sleep with it which was major problem with it (short-term ofc).\n \nAs for meth... at first you are productive, or maybe euphoric, if you are experienced in other amphetamines you know you can't use it everyday, you know you have to eat and sleep, you are aware that you have to maintain personal hygiene, job/school...

No other medications were working for my nerve pain.

I found out that my 5mg was a third of what some people get, so why not 3? Then I find out 6 is okay, just not all the time due to the acetaminophen. Then I run out, and I'm googling highs similar to Vicodin. I find kratom. I start taking it every day all day. It was fucking great for a while tbh, low-key nodding off in a warm blanket every night, don't give a damn if you don't believe me.\n\nThen I'm getting deeper and deeper into all the different reddits. I find out I can get high on my gabapentin if I took it the right way. Gabby had to be my favorite of all. Then I ran out and found some on the clear web which still felt risky as fuck considering the package had \"prescription medication\" written all over it. But I had a shit ton.\n\nI'm slowly spiraling deeper mentally over 2 years, kratom keeping me and my grades afloat as it became less sedating and more my 'happy powder'. I have a few hellish experiences with dxm. I'm mixing the Gabby, kratom, whiskey, weed, here and there. Risking a lot to get the weed might I add. Abusing the shit out of the kratom. Fucking around with phenibut. Basically keeping all these things on rotation like a true poly-addict. Even occasionally messing around with dxm still,  even though it was hell every time (speaks to where my head was at).\n\nTaking kratom and Gabby at my old job all the time because I hated it and they hated me and I was trying to cope. It's making me say really stupid shit and making a fool of myself.\n\nI eventually find out my county health department offers mental health services for next to free if you're unemployed (pro tip btw). I try Prozac, Wellbutrin, Lexapro with mild success. I'm getting the typical anhedonia and sexual dysfunction that many experience with SSRIs. I quadrupled my kratom intake while on the SSRIs and still couldn't feel it, but still didn't want to quit it (in hindsight this must've also contributed to the anhedonia). Therapy just felt like we weren't getting anywhere, no plan, just random topics from my past each time, didn't learn anything. In hindsight it was still good to vent to someone. I do remember my back pain (unrelated to the aforementioned nerve pain) miraculously disappearing during this time. I'm not usually the type to believe in hippy dippy shit, but they say chronic pain can be caused by unreleased emotion. Look up a summary of \"Mind-Body Prescription\" if you're curious about the topic. Anyway, gave up the therapy and SSRIs after a few months because there was a point where I watched the footage of that mosque shooting in New Zealand where he streamed it to Facebook, and I felt nothing while it made my friend sick to his stomach.\n\nFast forward 4 years from that Vicodin Rx. I'm now independent and live on my own and have my own career that gives me some fulfillment, simply because it challenges me and I can tell I'm slowly getting better, and I'm contributing to a team. Pretty much clean other than kratom a couple times a week. Still trying to give that up although I wouldn't be where I am without it.

I felt more euphoric from that first roughly 400mg dose than I ever have felt from dxm, and ever since I\u2019ve constantly been trying to relive that moment. For about 4 months I did dxm every day, taking 8-12 triple C\u2019s ever day before first period of my junior year. If it wasn\u2019t a school night I would eat the whole box of 16 and smoke a blunt or two on the peak. This brought my grades down to F\u2019s at record speed, and I was always too fucked up to understand the teacher or remember homework, I only  just barely graduated because the administration of my school had a soft spot for me and helped me pass my classes. I\u2019m aware now that CCC\u2019s are by far the worst form/ brand of dxm to consume, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that I\u2019ve consumed thousands of those red pills in the past 3 years. My stomach used to feel iron, now my lining is so fucked up I throw up no matter what I take and it\u2019s difficult to keep down anything. My memory is severely short nowadays most likely attributed to the dxm and the weed which have both stayed pretty present in my system for the past 3 years to say the least. Every time \u201cI quit\u201d dxm I\u2019ll accidentally see it in a grocery store 5 days later and end up purchasing it or stealing especially if I don\u2019t already have other drugs at home. Anything to kill my sober mind, I\u2019m all for it. \nI abused psychedelics heavily (acid or mushrooms 3-4 times a week) for about a  5 month period, other than that they\u2019re sort of an \u2018I\u2019ll do them if I feel mentally stable and I have time\u2019 kinda thing. Except mushrooms, I could easily wake up every day and eat a gram and I\u2019d enjoy it and be a nicer person. Weed has always kept me feeling stable until pretty recently, now it just kinda boosts my paranoia and makes me think about how I could be higher if I spent the money on actual drugs which doesn\u2019t help my repeated failed attempts to stop my drug use. DPH is an awful drug all around, referred to in my friend group as \u201cliquid anxiety\u201d, which is exactly what it is in my opinion. Did DPH twice is very large amounts and felt like I had drank liquid fear, would not recommend and would not try again. \n(Also just for age reference I\u2019m currently 18 and I drank my first bottle of dxm when I was 14 which is what sparked all of this crazy shit that has ultimately become my life)", "replies": {"g1bjujm": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/i8qnpb/my_entire_list_of_drugs_ive_consumed_in_the_past/g1bjujm/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597350031.0, "body": "With me, I got into DXM after a break up from my first real relationship, and I was immensely lonely and depressed, and for about half a year I abused DXM, starting weekly, then every other day, and then everyday and my depression and derealization was already there, so adding to it fucked with me. Eventually I attempted suicide via DXM, and my family thinks I'm addict even though stuff like that doesn't happen for me unless there's a reason\n Id say DXM can be used as a learning substance kinda like ketamine or psychedelics, but dissociatives just don't have the same safety profile.

Opiates and similar, uppers, Benzos,  even cannabis, with the exception of Kratom, given I switch \"strains\" and vendors every few days. It started after high school when I got Into hydrocodone. It would last a good 4 hours at first, then it slowly started to lose it's magic, of course. But then I started doing OxyContin did that a lil while, fucked with Xanax and alcohol a lot then started messing with uppers, which I overdid it with methylphenidate patches (I know stupid, but I was 19) and ended up having a very bad time and had some delusions, once those died down I had a hard time with anxiety and drank quite a bit 1.75 in 24 hour period I also know, stupid. \n I don't know if any of that is super relevant to my question, but like I literally can't take hydrocodone for pain even, it won't work. Ritalin works but the euphoria leave FAST.

I just would like to know why i lose my magic with basically ever drug my body has ever done, no matter how long or much I took. I have to take drugs that have some kind of ER to it. Doesn't matter if its speed based opiate-based or cannabis. It's truly irritating, i have cut down on drugs and the only thing i take daily is kratom.

My tongue and mouth feel weird.", "replies": {}}}}, "ijv5fl": {"text": "These are my drug ratings of the drugs I have done so far. Downers are going to tend to be ranked higher because I just like to say fuck it and forget everything. \n\nWeed- 9.5/10. Substance you can use all the time, and nobody can really tell your high. This is when your tolernace is huge like mine. Only reason not a 10 is tolerance. \n\nOxycodone- 10/10. Most euphoric drug I\u2019ve tried, and the best opioid. Be careful, this can be hella addictive. 25mg catches me a nod. Amazing with weed \n\nHydrocodone- 7/10. Like oxy but I say 3 times weaker, and more sedating. Takes like 5 to even feel anything. Not really worth it but still a good drug . Addictive \n\nTramadol- 8/10. This one surprised me, it feels stronger than hydrocodone, and I\u2019m talking like 350mg tram imo would compare to 45mg hydro. Lasts all day and is energizing at the start then you might catch some nods toward the end. Mixes well with weed. Space the doses out, 50mg-100 every 20 minutes \n\nVyvanse- 4.5/10. Makes the day go by fast and the best stim I\u2019ve tried for productivity. Dry mouth is horrible and gives me nausea though. Comedown sucks \n\nFocalin- 6/10. Better than vyvanse, better euphoria but like no focus at all. Comedowns a little bit better \n\nXanax- 9/10. Best recreational benzo imo. Most sedating and best for anxiety I\u2019ve tried. Pop a xan then 25 minutes later go smoke a fat blunt and you are feeling good as fuck. Just doesn\u2019t last long \n\nK Pin- 8/10. Less sedating than Xanax, but around the same euphoria. Good with weed, and lasts a long time \n\nValium- 8/10. Good muscle relaxer and great for just chilling. Can\u2019t go wrong with diazepam. \n\nAtivan- 5/10. Never really got high off this just either put me to sleep if I took a high enough dose or completely wiped out anxiety. \n\nShrooms- 7.5/10. Tripped 3 times on these first time 2g and didn\u2019t really feel anything, next I took 3 grams and tripped pretty nice. Then a week later took 5 grams and didn\u2019t trip. The 3 gram trip was nice though and I wish to do more in the future as it might bump up the rankings. \n\nAcid- 8/10. I\u2019ve had really good times on this drug then really horrible. Set and setting. Euphoria is amazing. Please don\u2019t abuse this drug, major mental issues can happen \n\nDxm- 5/10. Really fucking weird. Made me trip harder than acid ever has, 500mg dxm will make you trip balls. Throwing up sucks though and that\u2019s what happens when you drink the syrup. Dirty high but a nice afterglow for the next couple of days. The only reason this isn\u2019t a 2 or 3 is because the afterglow. \n\nSynthetic weed- 3/10. Was on a bunch of Valium when I smoked this. I mean like a couple pinches of this stuff on some real gas in the gravity bong. Didn\u2019t really feel much but just really high. \n\nAlcohol- 6/10. Have had some fun ass times on this drug. Liquid confidence but tastes absolutely horrible. Rough on the stomach at times. Mixing with benzos can get really fun and crazy.\n\nCocaine- 5/10. Never really felt much. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever tried some good shit. Once I was with my friend and his co worker at subway doing lines but I was on xanax and I swear I couldn\u2019t feel the coke but my friend absolutely did. Wanna try again\n\nPhenibut- 6/10. Helped with anxiety, and made the day go by better. \n\nNicotine- 4/10. Makes me really nauseous and I feel it\u2019s a waste of money. But so is all drugs.

Yesterday for instance I took 50mg of Diazepam and 300mg of Tramadol, for the first 6 hours I was fine, feeling chill and happy, but then I was nodding the f\\*ck out and almost threw away every single think in my desk (almost I thought I ruined my monitor) trying to fight sleep. Hydrocodone is a harder opiate therefore it's more dangerous about cns depression.\n\nIn fact 2 months ago I had a seizure on Tramadol, (there were other drugs involved) but if I'll need to use Tramadol again I'll take it with a decent amount of benzos. Generally, you must be feeling the benzo doing something to prevent seizures. If you take X amount and don't feel anything, you are not protected from seizures.

Me, for instance, that I had a seizure on it, I absolutely need a benzo to take it again. I was taking Tramadol for years without benzos and no issues, the last year specifically almost daily at 300-450mg range every day without a benzo, until a seizure eventually happened.\n\nIf you take a small dose of benzo which sedates you just a little with slight muscle relaxation it's fine. If you take a bigger dose that knocks you out then definitely it's a big no-no, you're in high risk of cns depression.\n\nIf you want to stick with Tramadol, then stay under 250mg and only use max 2 times a week. The tolerance to this shit builds rapidly and withdrawals are nightmare. If you notice myoclonus when using Tramadol, it's a sign you used too much and you're in high risk of an upcoming seizure, and that's when you need to have a benzo in handy.\n\nTbh, I can't sum up if it's a good idea to have them both, just start very slowly on both and see how you feel. It's a controversial subject, make a search here in reddit about \"tramadol and benzo\" and read experiences to have an idea. All I know is benzos protect from tramadol seizures, but increase cns sedation. I've used this combo many times, and ended up nodding AF every time.

Only very recently have i cut back to just weed and alcohol (tapering off phenibut right now) But for years i would get high off of any drug humanly possible. \n\nits started at age 15. I tried marijuana, and opioids and multiple types of inhalants. \ni got addicted to hydrocodone very quickly and used inhalants when i couldnt access it. \ni even mixed nail polish remover with rubbing alchohol and huffed it. yeah it was bad. \n\ni got in trouble and remained somewhat clean for a while. while on probation i got fucked up off dph (a deliriant) and dxm several times. \n\nwhen i got off probation i abused anti depressents (i was desperate to get high) and noticed that they gave me bizzarre hallucinations and a very odd feeling overall. \n\ni eventually got i to weed again. then when my supply got cut off i switched to benadrul again abd abused it vety heavily for months. the hallucinations where facinating but terrifying and the body load sucked, but i only stopped whrn it seemingly quit working and felt like it wss gonna give me a heart attack. after that inotifed that tge milder hallucinations (things in my peripheram vision, after images, illusions) never stopped\n\ni got bavk into opioids and fell into a life ruining addiction. after about 2 years i eventually ended up taking huge doses of immodium 120mg a day and huge dose of benadryl (590mg to 2 grams a day) for several months. i ended up quitting benadryl then opioids in the span of 2 months. i felt strange. it was as if i was braindead for months. i was still having those corner of the eye hallucinations and some auditory hallucinations for a long time after quitting. \n\nat this point i was abusing gabapentin to fill tye opioid void. this went on for 3 years (with near constant marijuana use as well) until ireached this year. istopped taking anything, got a job and got my shit together. .\n\nthen i got into kratom to fill that void. mixed with getting drunk every day after work. then i quit alcohol and stayed on just kratom. after about 5 months kratom wasnt doing it for me anymore soi added phenibut. 1 month binge led to psychosis in the withdrawal. this led me to do a taper. which is just now in the process of dropping off altogether.  \n\nat this point i am at about 800mg phenibut a day, a few bowls of pot a day. and a moderate amount of alcohol at nighttime. \n\nover the last year i have notcied a huge increase in visual hallucinations. people in my peripheral vision. insects flying around the room. illusions. surfaces distorting. sometimes i will see a person and look up and they arent there. \never since my spur with benadryl i have had some memory loss. after my most recent sour with it its been alot worse. \n\nI have had increasingly more frequent auditory hallucinations lately as well.  sometimes its voices in my head. but usually its vague voices wgispering in myear. or dogs barking. or a woman crying under my floor while im trying to sleep. or voices whispering in unison with eachother. or the sounds of groaning suffering and misery. \n\ni have also been very deeply disturbed by veiwing MANY graphic videos of real violence online. i was once an empath. but now i feel nothing. i have seen all the real life photos horror and tragedy the internet has to offer. historical and otherwise. so perhaps this has effected my mental health as well. \n\nanother common visual hallucination that i expiruence is a small toddler that has a grey gown, short black hair, black holes for eyes and gray skin. it will only appear when iam not paying attention. then it will disappear if i look directly at it. when i look away sometimes i see it moving closer to me. with its arms outstretched, but distorted and just wrong. this is always accompanied by a sense of dread. why am i going so in depth? this just occurred as i was writing this. \n\nthis is every day. it has been getting worse since i quit kratom. i think it may have been my extensive use of blatantly dangerous drugs for years. but i am mor entirely sure. any ideas anyone?", "author": "lunaticpeniscrunch", "score": 34, "flair": "Harm Reduction", "created": 1577463193.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/eg8hxe/can_years_of_polydrug_use_cause_permanent/", "num_comments": 25, "title": "Can Years Of Polydrug Use Cause Permanent Hallucinations?", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fc4z5fy": {"score": 30, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/eg8hxe/can_years_of_polydrug_use_cause_permanent/fc4z5fy/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1577463672.0, "body": "It's really hard to say, but you do need medical attention.

They took me in and I ended up sitting on a gurney for about an hour. The tests apparently came back negative which I absolutely disagreed with. I was exhibiting every symptom of insecticide poisoning. I called bullshit and ordered them to keep me because I was scared about what was to come.\n\nThe doc came in and I eventually had my first psychotic break of that night. My reality slipped out from underneath me. Apparently, the class of insecticides called organophosphates are commonly used in kratom production and they can cause substance induced psychosis. However, sometimes the manufacturers forget to clean off the leaves before they powderize them. My batch was a bad batch and it kicked me in the ass. This initial test was overruled when they tested the kratom and found and a organophosphate insecticides (these are popular insecticides for kratom and most plants or plant-based drugs)\n\nI was then given 50mg Ziprasidone and admitted to intensive care. This is where the real hell started. They wouldn't let me use my phenibut. I was taking 5-7gpd and I knew exactly what was coming based on my personal knowledge of the withdrawal from that dosage. What came was exactly what I was expecting. I explained to them the pharmacology of Phenibut and they started giving me 10mg baclofen and 600mg gabapentin every 6 hours. I explained to them that this dosage wasn't enough and explained to them the baclofen-phenibut ratio (10mg Baclofen = \\~0.9 grams Phenibut), but they refused to give me more than 20mg baclofen every 6 hours with 10mg diazepam every 3 hours. This absolutely wasn't enough. The bell curve of Phenibut withdrawal was really kicking my ass.\n\nAt first I had the rebound symptoms which were manageable. However, around 18 hours later, the worst of the symptoms quickly made themselves apparent. Within 2 hours I was hallucinating with a similar intensity to 200mcg LSD with moderate-severe derealization. Not a good combination. I told them that I was hallucinating and having bad derealization and that Psychosis was imminent and they said my next baclofen and gabapentin was in an hour. I started pacing around my room saying fuck over and over again as the derealization, anxiety, and hallucinations grew stronger. And then, boom, reality was broken. I screamed \"no, no, fuck, no, this isn't happening fuck\" and ran out with no control of my body to the front desk and told them that I was going thru psychosis and to give me 20mg baclofen and 600mg gabapentin right now or it was going to get worse. I started thinking that they were doing it on purpose maliciously and completely believed it and started accusing them of it.\n\nI was yelling at them about how they were intentionally torturing me in order to show me hell and security had to walk me back to my room. Around 5 minutes later baclofen and gabapentin were wheeled into my room with a cup of water. I refused the water because I thought they had poisoned it and insisted on drinking my hot chocolate because I didn't trust them. The entire time I was taking the pills I was viciously insulting them, calling them faggots (not something I do like ever), devil's minions (I don't even believe in organized religion), assholes, threats to hurt them if they did that kind of thing again (which got security involved again), threats to make myself throw up on the floor outside my room, etc. I was just completely disconnected and filled with extreme rage and I probably would have tried something stupid if it wasn't for the ativan I was given 45 minutes prior.\n\nI remember laying down and waiting for the drugs with my eyes closed and the visuals were absolutely ineffable. By far the most detailed and disturbing hallucinations I've ever seen. I kept hearing my name yelled from the front office. Every time I ran in hastily and none of them ended up calling my name. In the moment, I thought they were just fucking with me which made me more aggravated. I was clacking my teeth and they had corresponding extremely detailed synesthesic hallucinations which made me confused as to where my teeth were. I kept seeing my room change. There was blood dripping from the walls and at one point it looked like it had been bombed. I also kept feeling like I was on the side of the wall and the bathroom, tv, and lounge were actually the floor and if I moved I would fall. I even felt pulled down so I had to grab onto the top of the bed. This filled me with anxiety because I felt as if I fell, I would die. There were constantly highly detailed tall figures in mirrors and windows that made me feel like I was being watched.\n\nWhen I took the baclofen and gabapentin I was immediately relieved. They gave me 30mg Baclofen and 900mg Gabapentin this time, which helped immensely. Within 20 minutes, my reality was back to normal and the hell was over. They ended up keeping this dose every 4 hours and it prevented the withdrawal from becoming that intense. I was still anxious as hell, but as long as I wasn't hallucinating, I was fine.\n\nPhenibut withdrawal is no joke. So far Phenibut has had the MOST severe and visceral withdrawal I've ever experienced. I withdrew from 6 months of 10-20mg Clonazepam and it wasn't SHIT compared to phenibut withdrawal. I've withdrawn from 150-200mg hydrocodone and it wasn't SHIT compared to phenibut. I withdrew from a bottle of vodka every day for 4 months and it wasn't SHIT compared to phenibut withdrawal.\n\nPlease be careful and do not EVER take phenibut more than 2-3 times a week.

Every substance consists of several chemicals in different concentrations. ofcourse they will find other things\n\nThose symptoms are really...unspecific tbh. Body and face tingles can be induced by panic attacks. Small pupils are usually a side effect of opioids so nothing suspicious there aswell. \nDisorientation and anxiety and tremors are also main symptoms of panic attacks since your body is overloaded with adrenalin. In addition kratom is known to increase blood pressure and elevate the heart rate. People often get something like 140-160mmHg / 90-100 especially if you are prone to this side effect. I even heard of someone who gets up to over 200mmHg systolic while taking kratom on the regular basis (this is not healthy btw). 199 is definitely really high but still nothing unsual if you have a panic attack and on top of that even fever is a common and well known side effect. The first time I took kratom i also got a fever and my bloop pressure was at 150 to 110 for over an hour and my heart beat was up at around 130 bpm. I am a pretty anxious person so I thought I would die this moment and I didnt took kratom for around 2 month but then curiosity took over and I started to consume from the same batch again but in lower amounts. What is strange is that sometimes I get this racing heart and higher bloodpressure but sometimes not... whatever. What I want to say is that its highly unlikely you got insecticide poisoning. Not because its not possible but more because you wouldnt really know and what you stated here are really all the usual side effects of panic attacks.\n\nEdit: Quickly checked what are the common symptoms of insecticide poisoning (and especially organophosphate poisoning). Its more or less the opposite of what OP stated.\n\n-bradycardia (slow heart beat)\n-sudden bloodpressure drop (and therefore induced shock)\n-respiratory paralysis\n-miosis (small pupils)\n-coma\n-cardiac arrest\n\n(nearly) all organophosphates have a really short half life which means they decompose a lot after a few days to maximum a few weeks. The most common ones in indonesia,bali and thailand are: Malathion (Ld50: 290mg/kg), dichlorvos(LD50 50mg/kg) and ethion(Ld50 40-70mg/kg). Usually plant matter consists up to 2% (freshly sprayed on. The real amount is way way way way less. Usually around 1mg/kg) of insecticides which means that 100g of kratom has a maximum of 2g pure insecticides in it which is a crazy hypothetical amount but lets say there are 2g inside for now. \n\nLD50 is the amount of substance you have to take in order to have a 50% probability to die. Ethion is probably the most toxic one here with 40mg/kg. A normal human being (70-190mg/kg) would have to take at least 2.8g of pure ethion which would equal to 140g of kratom. Also what is maybe interesting is the fact that ethion has a half life of 1 week up to 7 weeks and between the last use of insecticides and the harvest/drying/shipping definitely some time passes. Last but not least most organophosphates (including ethion) dont start to effect the human body immideately. First effects start 30-120min after intake with minor dizziness and a headache. The peak for ethion is at 12-36hours.(malathion peaks at 5-12days)\nThis is because most organophosphates get their real toxicity from their metabolites. In case of malathion its malaoxon which is 10 times more toxic.\n\nFurthermore all reports stated that victims of insecticide intoxication werent able to speak properly, didnt really knew what was going on and needed artificial respiration. Insecticide poisoning can also be validated with a quick bloodtest on pseudocholinesterase and then you would get a shot of highly concentrated atropin. It was definitely not an insecticide poisoning and btw I never heard of any similar case", "replies": {"fij2gec": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/f5tglp/i_had_psychosis_from_phenibut_withdrawal_again/fij2gec/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1582461920.0, "body": "Yeah it sounds like all the drama was the withdrawal....and he ends his post with saying it sucks so I\u2019m not getting where the insecticide poisoning is coming in.

Eventually I needed a break from the pain so I took a couple. Was playing cards with friends and within twenty to thirty minutes I began to feel a deep inner peace, some euphoria, no pain, and happy. I left the card game early to lay down since I felt nauseous. What I also liked about tramadol was the duration. Four hours to the peak and four hours of the peak. I used to roll a backwoods and smoke that around two hours in. Worked for over a year and then felt nothing. Took a three month break, took a couple one time, and still felt nothing. Another two to three month break and felt nothing. Not sure why that is.\n\nTemazepam melted my anxiety away, felt euphoric and not sure how to explain the other feelings. And got me to bed quickly.\n\nSeroquel gave me the munchies as if I had smoked herb, took Xanax, drank booze, and had a certain calmness.\n\nClozapine made me sleep a lot and made me numb to emotions which was good for a while since I was going through a lot. That helped me think through things easier.\n\nValium gets rid of anxiety and is subtle and lasts all day. Also works on muscle tension from other meds I'm on and helps with muscle spasms.\n\nDXM is an incredible compound with the opportunity to Heal and Learn.\n\nGabapentin was good at reducing pain and anxiety and also came with some effects similar to smoking herb without the head high, no inhibitions, cognitive and body euphoria.\n\nLyrica helped a lot with pain, had really cool CEV, euphoria, no cares in the world, munchies, but when mixed with alcohol can lead to an OD, blackout, and/or loss of motor function", "replies": {"f9j6fog": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/e58qov/drugs_ive_tried_in_my_lifetime_and_top_5_drug/f9j6fog/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1575386991.0, "body": "I found Lyrica at doses higher than 300mg felt kinda MDMAish.

In this state, depending on how much you smoke, you\u2019ll be able to focus more on whatever task you\u2019re doing and you\u2019ll be able to think more creatively. After about 5 hours you\u2019ll start to come down but you\u2019ll definitely still feel the effects. This combo is great because it provides a good increase in focus without robbing you of your creativity like other stimulants tend to do. Recreationally it also makes whatever weed you\u2019re smoking feel 4x as strong. The LSD never overpowers it, it really just makes the high feel better.", "replies": {}}}}, "fn4m2x": {"text": "Everybody seems to be doing this right now for some reason, and I have nothing better to do so I thought I'd hop on the wave as well. Here is a list of (almost) all of the drugs I've done, how I would rate them on a scale of 1-10 and why. Also, just a fair warning before you proceed: a lot of my ratings for each of the following drugs will *most likely* differ from most other people's. Drugs affect everybody differently. These are how I rate all of the drugs I've tried based on how they affect *me.*\n\n# Alcohol\n\n* **Alcohol (5/10)** \\- I was never a fan of alcohol. I think it tastes absolutely terrible and that getting drunk is not worth the physical consequences of drinking. That's really all I have to say about it.\n\n# Cannabinoids\n\n* **Cannabis (2/10)** \\- I'm definitely in the minority with this one. I absolutely despise weed. Now, I have nothing against people who smoke weed, if this stuff floats your boat and is something you enjoy, then, by all means, go for it. But cannabis was never something I enjoyed and I plan to never smoke it again a day in my life. It doesn't even give me anxiety, I just don't like the lethargic feeling produced by a cannabis high. It does not make me happy nor feel good, and I want to stay as far away from this drug as I possibly can from now on. I love drugs, just not this one.\n\n# Stimulants\n\n* **Caffeine (8/10)** \\- I'm rating this drug based on the high it produces, which is a solid eight out of ten for me. Caffeine doesn't really *deserve* that high of a rating though for one simple reason: tolerance. You could never have drank a cup of coffee a day in your life, drink it for five days in a row, and by day six you don't feel a thing. I know caffeine is pretty much *the* most popular drug there is and as a result, gets (ab)used a lot making tolerance seemingly rise quickly, but I don't think that's the case. I think tolerance to caffeine really *does* raise quickly as quickly as it seems to. But the high is nothing short of amazing when it actually does work. *Never* underestimate the power of caffeine.\n* **Cocaine (1/10)** \\- Quite possibly the least psychoactive and worst drug I have ever tried in my life. Maybe I've only ever tried shitty coke, but I've done it about 7 or 8 times and have gotten shitty coke every single time. But even if I got the real deal, I would still imagine that it's not even worth it. Not worth the price, not worth the harm it does to your body, plus it pretty much doesn't mix with *anything.* I would not recommend this at all. Don't waste your money or time. If you're going to buy drugs, there are way better things to spend your money on. Please do yourself a favor and don't waste it on this.\n* **Adderall IR (10/10)** \\- Once again, I feel like I'm kind of in the minority with this one. A lot of people are probably looking at this and wondering what in the world I'm thinking, but hear me out. Adderall is my saving grace. While I live my life often chasing *some* sort of high, buzz or adrenaline, this is by far one of my favorite highs out of all the drugs on this list. It absolutely demolishes any anxiety I have and I barely get a comedown from it. Of all stimulants, this one's crash/comedown impacts me the least. I become productive, confident, get shit done and it makes me not feel worthless. Not to mention it doesn't \"fuck you up\", it just makes you feel even more sober than if you actually were, but in a good way; the type of sober you *wish* you could always be (if that makes sense). There's nothing else in the world that can do what this drug can for me.\n* **\u27a5 Adderall XR (7/10)** \\- Has all the same effects as immediate release, except despite having supposed to last about 12 hours or so, I notice the mental euphoria last *much* less than that but the physical stimulation last much *more* than that. It just feels like an unbalanced high, or like a drug that's \"incomplete\", for lack of a better word.\n* \u27a5 **Vyvanse (9/10)** \\- All the same things as Adderall, as well as balances out the *imbalances* of Adderall XR. I just rate it lower than Adderall because its comedowns are a little bit harsher on me.\n* \u27a5 **Ritalin (6/10)** \\- Think of it like Adderall IR, but *extremely* dumbed down. It's like Adderall's baby cousin in training. Not really worth it. If it's all you can get your hands on though, it'll still satisfy me.\n* \u27a5 **Concerta (7/10)** \\- Concerta has always treated me fairly well. Like Ritalin is a dumbed-down version of Adderall IR though, this is a dumbed-down version of Vyvanse. Only issue I have with it is that I actually experience minor symptoms of psychosis when I come down from it. Haven't touched it since.\n* \u27a5 **Focalin IR & XR (5/10)** \\- Same as the other methylphenidates (Ritalin and Concerta) except tolerance raises fairly quickly and the high is even less noticeable than that of Ritalin or Concerta's.\n* **MDMA (9/10)** \\- The only thing preventing this from being a ten is the [three-month rule](https://rollsafe.org/page/how-often-can-you-take-mdma-molly-ecstasy-and-roll/) and its neurotoxicity. When taken the right way and responsibly, MDMA is relatively harmless, but *can* have some lasting negative consequences when instructions aren't followed properly. I do love it just as much as Adderall though, for sure. I just can't take it as often, whereas I can take Adderall *much* more often, which gives me a high that makes me ecstatic and holds me over until I can take MDMA again, thus MDMA never loses its magic for me.\n\n# Benzodiazepines\n\n* **Xanax (4/10)** \\- Xanax doesn't really do anything to me besides make me woozy. I was never really a fan of it overall and the high is relatively short as well. It doesn't even aid my anxiety at all. I never understood what all the hype was about over this drug.\n* **Klonopin (8/10)** \\- Now *this* is where it's at as far as benzos go, both for recreational and medical use. This is a benzo that not only actually *works,* but when it does, it produces a high that not only reduces my anxiety but also makes me feel like myself again. It really puts into perspective how much my anxiety holds me back. To take this and not experience any anxiety again (like a did years ago) feels so amazing, it makes me feel like I did when I was in my mid-teens (I'm 20 now).\n\n# Opioids\n\n* **Hydrocodone (4/10)** \\- This one is kind of \"eh\". Not really impressed with it. Never made me too euphoric or anything, just made me super tired and just knocked me out for a few hours. Not seeing what the hype is about with this one (if there is any).\n* **Oxycodone (7/10)** \\- But *this one* makes up for it. Having restored my faith in getting a satisfying experience from painkillers, the high this one produces *does* make me a little bit tired, but not tired to the point where I just need to knock out. I'm able to stay awake, ride it out and feel damn good from this stuff. It's no Adderall in my book, but still nice for recreational use, kicking back for the day or treating yourself to a little something.\n\n# Psychedelics\n\n* **LSD (9/10)** \\- This is actually the only psychedelic I've ever tried, though I do want to try psilocybin (mushrooms) as well as DMT at some point in the future, but I will cross that bridge when I come to it. Anyway, LSD, in a nutshell, is essentially like getting a bird's eye view of your mind, thoughts, and inflates your conscience to the extreme. I once had a good trip (the first time I ever took it) and it was by far *the* most blissful, euphoric, positive and uplifting experience of my life. I don't think anything else in the world will ever top that experience except another good trip that's just as good if not better. As a result, having seen the potential this drug has, I give it a nine out of ten, which *would* be a ten out of ten, only I've personally experienced way too many bad, negative, anxiety-filled and traumatizing trips for me to give it that extra point. But then again, of course, I had bad trips for reasons that were *my* fault; not the drug itself's fault. I was taking it in the wrong set and setting and was not spacing out my trips. The rules for taking this drug are simple and straightforward; follow them and you will be fine.\n\nAnd that's my list. Forgive me for its industrial length, but I just had some extra time on my hands and really wanted to get out everything I had to say about each drug I've tried while keeping each explanation as short as I can.\n\nWhat do you agree/disagree with on my list?

Word of advice from a guy who experienced similar drug habits; try to just chill (on the drug use) and enjoy life. Whatever your situation is at home or whoever you associate with, just try to put more effort into self improvement. Try getting into some healthy hobbies. Listen to podcasts that aren\u2019t about drugs, read some books, paint, journal, hit the gym, go on walks. Whatever you gotta do. Drugs will lose their luster quick and when that happens you\u2019ll likely either move to harder drugs or become depressed. You are young and resilient. Be smart. Drink water. Your body and mind is a fragile balance of chemicals. Aside from body/brain damage, habitual prolonged drug use can easily lead to mental and emotional problems. Just look at the big picture, get educated as to how these things are affecting your body and mind and why you feel the urge to use them. You are young and probably have a unique perspective on life so take advantage of those things and do something positive with yourself. Not trying to preach but I just wish I had someone to tell me these things a few years ago(though I wouldn\u2019t have listened). Anyways, you\u2019ve got a long road of life ahead of you, don\u2019t take all the drugs now, you\u2019ll regret it later.

I STILL DO NOT HAVE A DIAGNOSIS. \n\nTolerance scares me, especially with Valium, I'm trying to scale it down but it's hard because it helps so much, and I'm starting to feel oxy's tolerance rise again (I'm at 40mg/day), I've asked my doctor to switch to morphine or hydromorphone, the only two opioids I've not tried yet and are available in pill form, hydrocodone isn't available as pills in my country for some reason I don't know, only usable as IV solution in hospitals... \n\nCodeine, Dyhidrocodeine, Tramadol (made me puke three time a day), Tapentadol (gave me some creepy hallucinations), Buprenorphine (transdermal, useless), only codeine worked, for like a month, then it stopped working and now that my pain is horrible, so horrible I can barely walk, so trying codeine again would require REALLY HIGH DOSES, knowing that codeine metabolizes to morphine, that's why I asked my doctor to try it with an equianalgesic dose to my oxy dose.\n\nAnyway, oxy's the only drug that helped me dealing with pain, but as I said now I'm starting to feel the tolerance, even with Valium I'm feeling the tolerance (went from 5mg to 10mg).\n\nOpioids and benzos are two of the most dangerous drugs out there and their withdrawals are the worst... I hope to find a cure for my pain, but when it will happen, if it will happen (it's three years I'm looking for a diagnosis) it would be like hell... I was thinking about stopping with the oxy first, with the help of the Valium, and then stopping with the Valium which shouldn't be too hard since it has a really long half life and I'm not psychologically dependent on it, I mean, I can go for a day or two without it, if only the pain let me do it more...\n\nAnyway, it's horrible to be forced to be addicted to those drugs because your body hates you, it's so scary to think about that maybe I will have to take those drugs for my entire life... It's so horrible when people question your pain and tell you that you're faking it, and that you're a junkie looking for drugs, that don't Advil is enough and oxycodone is a drug for cancer patients, that I don't really need it (while sadly I NEED IT).\n\nAnd I must admit that hearing those things sometimes makes you want to take more than you should take, just to feel numb and not feeling like a complete waste of oxygen like people tree you.. And that's makes me even more scared, luckily those things happened a couple of times but... I'm sick of being called a junkie, a pussy, that I'm faking/exaggerating my pain, that I don't need my meds and I just need to do sport or physiotherapy and everything like that.. And it's not acquaintances or people I don't know telling me this shit, it's my family, my friends, my doctors, everyone and fuck, it's horrible.\n\nI already know I'm addicted to oxy and Valium, there's no need to put shame on me just because I need them, I already feel like shit about it and I don't need people to remind me.\n\nSorry for the vent, and for every grammar mistake I could have made, but today I'm feeling like shit and I don't want to check the post for errors... have a nice day.", "author": "Teapots_that_can_fly", "score": 7, "flair": "OPIOIDS AND BENZOS", "created": 1579895402.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/et9djz/using_two_of_the_most_addicting_drugs_to_treat_my/", "num_comments": 17, "title": "Using two of the most addicting drugs to treat my pain is awful and scary, but I can't live without them.", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"ffevbml": {"score": 13, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/et9djz/using_two_of_the_most_addicting_drugs_to_treat_my/ffevbml/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1579895900.0, "body": "At least you are somewhere that you can afford the drugs.\nImagine being an uninsured American.", "replies": {"ffevi4w": {"score": 9, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/et9djz/using_two_of_the_most_addicting_drugs_to_treat_my/ffevi4w/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1579896110.0, "body": "> uninsured American. \n\nAs someone from Germany I still cant understand how its even possible to live without insurance.

Its quite long as well!)\n\nBackground: Hey, to start things off imma give a bit of a background, you can always skip the background! This trip happened about 3-4 days ago in my parents house at around 10 PM, I had bought an eighth off a friend of mine. Keep in mind this is my first trip, haven't done acid nor shrooms before. Only drugs I've done is DXM, DPH, weed, hydrocodone, valium, etc. I did have a LSA experience b4 (morning glory seeds) but it was shit, only thing I remember is just laughing for no reason, big ass pupils, and minor visuals but a fuck ton of throwing up and stomach pains. Now I know what some are going say \"3.5 for the first time?!?\" I knew this was quite a lot but I was stupid and disrespected the power of shrooms as many do and thought this probably won't feel very strong. Part of the reason why I took this is because I had a bad drug abuse it fucked a lot in my life. I was doing better with my abuse but I kept getting cravings which was controllable but still annoying and no matter what I did it wouldn't go away. I heard shrooms make you quit drugs and such if done right. Now I'd be lying if I said I didn't take it for the trip itself and was something on my drug to do list. I'd done a lot of reaserch on shrooms/lsd for maybe a year but I was never able to find someone who had it and when someone did have it I didn't have the money. I remember looking at many visual representations, trip reports, etc. What I didn't know is those visual representations are nothing like the trip even if its considered accurate by most it really only depicts maybe 10-20% of the trip. Anyways time to get into the trip grab some food and a drink, cause this is a long one. (Added some links as well so you peeps can get an idea)\n\n0: I started off eating the 3.5g shrooms raw with some orange juice to chase it down. I had about 4-5 of em in the bag, it looked like the cubensis strain (forgot to mention I hadn't eaten anything in 4 hours) I remember smelling the bag, the best way to describe it is, it smells like when you go to a petting zoo. The taste on the other hand wasn't that that bad like most say I would say it had a taste of stale Doritos with an earthy taste also crunchy. The taste scared me tbh I thought I'd spit it out as soon as it went into my mouth specially since I had eaten it raw without a sandwich or tea mixture.\n\n\\+10: I am getting ready to go to my room, I decided first time its best to trip alone and at night. I am washing up the dishes and I start getting a mild giggly feeling with disconnection. I remember looking at my hands and they felt like they weren't mine kinda like DXM. This might be because of how much I had taken DXM in the past, pretty sure thats not normal but I could be wrong.\n\n\\+25: After I finish the dishes I remember going to the bathroom to brush my teeth and first thing I notice was how giant my pupils are and for whatever reason I was dying of laughter from how fucked up I already look but I was panicking a bit thinking if my mom saw me she would know I am high asf from a mile away. I brush quickly, grab my phone and wire and hit the bed. I remember the bed looked like a toy house everything looked like a cartoon but it wasn't that obvious. I shut off the lights, lay on my bed, and started browsing through my phone while giggling here and there for no reason. I also recall my hearing was super sensitive it also felt very very clear.\n\n\\+50: I start hearing a jungle (birds chirping and just sounds you'd expect from a jungle) in my room kinda odd and I could see a pattern over my wall in fact it was everywhere (I was able to find the pattern I knew I recalled it from somewhere when I saw it:  [https://prnt.sc/qk302o](https://prnt.sc/qk302o) ) it looked like that but I could see through it and it was split apart. It was quite calming, haven't been this calmed and relaxed in awhile. I started giggling more now, and the body load kicked in. Also noticed whenever i looked at my phone my vision would vibrate for like 10 seconds. The phone had a halo around it as well. I remember one of friends texted me (haven't talked to him in maybe a year) and the letters were moving it was very odd. He knew I was tripping though I was acting quite weird with what I said and my typing. He saved some of my messages apparently I said letters were breathing/moving and my room looks like ancient Egypt.\n\n\\+1:10?: Time is going really slow at this point and this where the real trip starts, I felt x10 more fucked up I remember just feeling like someone was pushing me down or left/right and my room that had the patterns on the wall started turning red also I remember my room looking like this as well ( [https://psychedelicreplication.tumblr.com/image/44880155046](https://psychedelicreplication.tumblr.com/image/44880155046) ) and the forest sound was replaced with a demonic evil sound (the more I thought about it the more I could describe the sound it was the sound of guns being shot and marching but with an evil tone to it). I remember hearing my parents talking it sounded normal at first but then started becoming really distorted and turned into a demonic voice with no meaning (basically speaking a different language). This is when I was freaking out a bit, and it came to me I was being pushed to hell (it made sense with the demonic voices and the red patterns plus being pushed down). I closed my eyes and saw a really scary figure surrounding my entire vision. I opened my eyes trying to calm myself down telling myself this is all just a trip it will end. The most confusing part was how did 4-5 stems get me into so much, it was mind blowing I couldn't believe it. This was also when I called myself an idiot for not taking the warnings seriously of taking so much for the first time also believe this is why I am in this state for abusing the shrooms.\n\n\\+1:30: I realized the reason I was in hell was because of how ignorant and foolish I was it all clicked, this was partially because of my abuse even though I could quit I didn't want to and I lied to my parents and friends telling them I would quit. My body started punishing me when I thought about DXM specfically since it was the only one I could take due to the drug tests I get. It would hurt me in a weird way not painfully but in a really odd way, best way to describe is its like my body is trying expel it and any trace of it from my body (burning it off completely) I then started getting really emotional thinking of all the damage the drugs have done to me and others around me. I was thinking about my mom how much she cares about me and what shes done for me. How selfish I was not quitting my abuse even though I could if I wanted to. It honestly hurt more than anything I told myself I would quit and never touch those drugs again. I then looked across my room and saw a white light just open like a portal to somewhere? I felt the pushing again and I was pushed up to somewhere I felt like I was traveling different worlds, this is where I was thinking how shrooms are like a story each time you take it its unlocking more of the story (not sure if thats how it works but thats what ran through my head). The demonic auditory hallucination was replaced by a song called stop trying be god -Travis Scott ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqvCptqhHfs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqvCptqhHfs) I am a huge Travis fan btw his songs are a vibe specially the older ones) specially the intro and the end no lyrics though just instrumental of the song. Looking back it at it made no sense and in fact it still doesn't but I am trying to correlate it with the white light I saw across my room the \"god\" part. Not sure what happened after though, pretty much blacked out.\n\n\\+2:00 I decided to finally lift myself off the bed and man was it the most amazing thing I've seen in my entire life. First thing I noticed was my blanket had giant black hole openings that felt like it went on forever and it looked like the blanket extended miles long also I remember my room was basically a distorted city with lights (no lights were on besides the moonlight coming through the curtains) and I felt so free after that bad trip ended like I accomplished something big. I was in tears from how amazing it was and confused because I heard you don't see things on shrooms. I can't quite describe anymore than the city and blanket part since I was an idiot and didn't type my report the day I was tripping but all I know was it was something out of dream. My giggling came back again and was just as strong, I felt dreamlike. I remember moving my hand and time would reverse or speed the fuck up (i knew this because of i would look up at my wall and the patterns would either race fast asf or reverse back). I would also somehow go in my head and out, I looked at myself from third person (like someone was in front of my face looking at me) and when that happened and saw my big ass simile just shining. When I went in my head I remember seeing memories but I don't remember any of them now. I also remember when I was putting my phone on the charger it looked like a mini jungle when I looked at the cord connecting the the outlet and it felt like it extended forever in the darkness. Honestly beautiful, never seen anything like this before (suggest everyone tries this at least once in there lifetime). I then decided to look at trippy images and holy fuck I couldn't tell if it was gifs or the color shifting but the trippy images were basically moving with different color like this (  [https://66.media.tumblr.com/0ad4d43a17515ee905fcce97b368c07a/tumblr\\_mj1w0pE0HT1r7wwr6o1\\_400.gifv](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0ad4d43a17515ee905fcce97b368c07a/tumblr_mj1w0pE0HT1r7wwr6o1_400.gifv) ) made no sense to me how on earth that was possible.\n\n\\+2:40: I saw my phone and the person who gave me the shrooms texted me but for whatever reason I just didn't want to answer him(the phones light is so fucking trippy I remember I was able to somehow see the light itself and how far it could go up if that makes any sense). The shrooms were telling me to leave the phone and that its just a trip killer, so I left it alone I got bad vibes from the phone as well it didn't feel like something natural? I stood up for the first time to look at the outside, I remember how I had like no balance and my body load being more apparent now. I had to hold on to something so I wouldn't fall. I opened the blinds and we have a daycare by our house so I looked at the lights that were on and it was shifting to different colors it was so insane. The cars that were passing by were so bright and so slow yet oddly big asf. I went back to the bed and my hand caught on to a string, it was the most bizarre thing I ever felt and I remember I started noticing my legs were really sensitive when they brushed on each other it felt so weird I can't even describe it (I remember blushing extremely when I felt that lmfao). As I was playing with the string I was thinking about life more, I was thinking about my future career and about the possible war we would have with Iran. It made me sad thinking about why we have all this hate, why can't we get along. I started thinking about the cause being wealth and thats all it is now is wealth. I was thinking about the very past how people used to trade and stuff, shroom thoughts basically. I remember also thinking the states legalizing weed is to toy us around, I started thinking it was to distract us from whats going on from us being high and happy with the moment were in while they do the dirty work.\n\n\\+3:30: I decided to finally text my other friend back, it was the one who provided me with the shrooms. He asked me how I was doing. I told him everything that happened and he started getting worried I remember he shut off saving chat after 24 hours on snapchat and I recall my phone flashing red and blue (cop color, felt like the phone was tapped) as I was talking to him many of the visuals and feels started going away (like I said earlier shrooms gave me the idea that the phone was a trip killer and to my surprise it was). He told me he was going to sleep as he has work tomorrow so we end the convo. I decided to finally listen to music, it sounded like shit which was odd since many say it sounds good. I remember it sounded like I was in a box with the noise muffled a bit, so I turned it off.\n\n\\+4:00: I recall my last visual was seeing eyes everywhere just staring into my soul, it creeped me out a bit but all the other visuals had gone away. I started getting bored at this point, the trip pretty much ended besides distortions and sounds in my ear. I felt really tired, I think it was 2 am? Time was quite meaningless during the trip, I remember thinking about how useless it was for whatever reason.\n\n\\+10:00: I wake eventually not knowing how long I slept (lots of toss and turns). I felt mentally drained, exhausted, and confused. The visuals and distortions had gone away and my eyes were turning back to normal.\n\n\\+12:00: Some time passes by and I start feeling much better. I already feel different and my drug cravings are completely gone, I have much more respect for everyone. Pretty much life changing, I didn't think it would be that simple. 4 hour trip from eating something that grows off the ground and all the sudden I feel so much more different.\n\nToday: I haven't gotten any cravings for any of the drugs I had been abusing, the only craving I get is the next shroom trip. It was such an amazing experience I would def do it again but next time outside with friends! Considering it is the safest drug I don't mind craving it and I also don't plan on doing it a lot either.\n\nTL:DR I took 3.5g of shrooms saw quite a lot of shit I didn't expect. Deeply thought about my life, had some quite emotional moments. I was able to completely cut out my drug abuse just from a bad trip.", "author": "Sympockpa", "score": 51, "flair": "Psychedelics", "created": 1578365225.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ekyb3m/first_time_shroom_trip_35g_life_changing_insane/", "num_comments": 16, "title": "First Time Shroom Trip 3.5g (life changing, insane trip)", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fdeqpv9": {"score": 14, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/ekyb3m/first_time_shroom_trip_35g_life_changing_insane/fdeqpv9/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1578373424.0, "body": "What you're currently feeling the afterglow of shrooms.
