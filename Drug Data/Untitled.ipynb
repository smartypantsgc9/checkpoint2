       "'**NOTE: 5/10 is AVERAGE on my scale. Anything above is considered overall a worthwhile drug while anything below is something who’s flaws outweigh the benefits.**\\n\\n**Alcohol: GARBAGE/10**\\n*It’s always blown my mind that alcohol is society’s drug of choice. Maybe I’m just spoiled by superior substances, but even some of the most experienced druggies I know still get drunk on the regular. Euphoria essentially nonexistent. Makes you tired, stupid, and sick. The biggest draw is it’s disinhibitory properties, which are moderate at best compared sexy alpha drugs like phenibut, benzos, mdma, etc. Plus, it makes you feel like a literal pile of shit the next morning. If there’s any diehard alcoholics reading this, please, give your best defense in the comments. Most I’ve ever drank was 12 shots. Threw up a bunch, felt like shit the next day. Disgusting.*\\n\\n**Caffeine: 7/10**\\n*The everyman’s stim. In contrast to alcohol, I can definitely see why this is also society’s drug of choice. A nice, brief blast of focus and energy, a surprising amount of euphoria, and pretty forgiving when abused. I hate coffee so I use caffeine pills. I have ADHD and the caffeine legitimately treats my symptoms to a small extent. Also great to pair with downers, as it boosts euphoria and keeps you awake without being overpowering. Most I’ve ever taken is 10 200mg pills, would not recommend. When it all hit at once I was so over stimulated I cried.*\\n\\n**Nicotine: 2/10**\\n*In my opinion, probably the lamest drug ever. I don’t really have any beef with nicotine like I do with alcohol, it’s just a pathetic drug. The “buzz” is... I don’t even know what it is. Kind of stimulating. Kind of sedating. Goes from meh to unpleasant very quickly if you over do it. Best thing I can say about it is it’s nice on other substances, especially psychs and stims, for whatever reason. All that being said, this is easily the drug I do the most. Oops. I started vaping as a social crutch. When you’re hitting a vape, you don’t need to be talking, so it’s perfect to fill those terrifying lulls in conversation. Plus, sharing a vape is a quick easy way to make acquaintances and ingratiate yourself. It’s a very hard habit to kick, and I’ve not much motivation to do so, but if I could go back and decide not to get addicted I would definitely do so, given the health risks.*\\n\\n**Weed: 6/10**\\n*This one is hard, because a couple years ago, weed would’ve been an easy 10 for me. Weed at its best is a dream drug. Euphoric. Energizing or sedating depending on the strain. Enhances every aspect of life: music sounds better, movies and tv are more captivating, food tastes better, everything is just more beautiful. All that, combined with minimal health risks? Hell yeah. Unfortunately, at a certain point weed changed for me. I’m not sure if it’s from overuse or from doing psychs, as I’ve heard both can cause this. It’s not as bad for me as I’ve heard it is for some people, I can still enjoy being high, but it’s become more like a lowkey psych, which might sound great to some people but that’s not the vibe I want when I smoke. It’s not as cozy or sedating, instead being way more visual and stimulating, with a higher chance to make me anxious as the headspace is way more psychedelic as opposed to just kinda hazy. Most I’ve ever done is a 50 mg edible. I’ve probably smoked more than that THC wise but that’s hard to keep track of. 50mg ingested was practically a psychedelic experience, very euphoric, and the peak was very close to being overwhelming. After it peaked though I felt FANTASTIC. Edibles are now my favorite way to do THC as the cozy body high is still there.*\\n\\n**DXM: 7/10**\\n*I’ve got a love hate relationship with this drug. I am prone to getting nauseous and anxious on the come up of most drugs, and on DXM it’s especially brutal. I throw up 100% without fail on the come up, and generally just feel like complete trash. Sometimes, it’s so bad that it ruins the whole trip, and a bad DXM trip is not fun. But man, when it’s good, it’s goooood. The psych/disso/downer high is unlike anything else, and I’ve had my best drug experiences on dex. Extremely euphoric. Music is amazing. Visuals are amazing. Disso headspace is amazing. Afterglow is amazing. If I could consistently recreate a good DXM trip I would never do anything else. Most I’ve ever done is 600mg. I hit a low 3rd plateau and that remains to this day my most intense, mind blowing experience with any drug. I never robotrip without weed to smooth out the harshness, boost visuals, and reduce nausea.*\\n\\n**LSD: 6/10**\\n*Not much to say about acid that hasn’t been said already. Can be very fun, but given it’s exhausting duration and stimulating body load I find myself more prone to anxiety on acid than on some other psychs. I find the secret to a good acid trip is to have a plan. Even if your plan is to just lay around, listen to music, and watch trippy shit. Every time I take acid on a whim, even if my set and setting are great, I find myself getting bored and antsy. I also hate tripping in groups bigger than 2 or 3 at the most, and only with people I’m very comfortable with. I exclusively trip with phenibut now, to reduce anxiety and that overall stimmy feeling. Most I’ve ever done is 300ug and I’m fine with never doing more. Ego death on acid does not sound appealing to me.*\\n\\n**Shrooms: 8/10**\\n*Shrooms are way more my speed than acid. Shorter, less energizing, more natural body load, generally much better for what I like to do when I’m tripping, which is just lay around and soak in it. It’s a cozier, more joyful euphoria, as opposed to the speedy, synthetic euphoria from acid. Really the only downsides of shrooms are the greater risk of nausea and the deeper headspace. Most I’ve ever done was 4 grams, had an incredible trip. No anxiety, beautiful visuals, I felt at peace and in love with the world. Interestingly, my worst ever trip was on shrooms. It’s my fault for being irresponsible with set and setting. I did 2 grams and smoked a ton before going to see Spider Man: Into the Spiderverse. I didn’t tell the people I was with and I was completely taken aback by the trips intensity. I circled the drain on ego death, constantly forgetting and remembering who I was and where I was. In addition to the nausea and complete overstimulation from the move, I had a full blown panic attack and left the theater.*\\n\\n**MDMA: 9/10**\\n*I’ve had nothing but incredible experiences from mdma. Again, I don’t exactly have a unique perspective on this drug. Amazing euphoria. Amazing, loving headspace. Music and tactile sensations, amazing. I always feel like I’m exactly where I’m supposed to be. I’ve kept all trips 3 months apart, and I credit that to preserving the magic. Most I’ve ever done is 120mg of pure crystal in capsules.*\\n\\n**Ketamine: 6/10**\\n*I have very limited experience with ket, having only done it a handful of times. I like the disso headspace, and the blissful, comfy body high, but after DXM I was kind of underwhelmed. I haven’t tried to hole, and I haven’t mixed with any other substances, so I suspect that I’m missing the real potential of this drug. Most I’ve ever done is 100mg insufflated over the course of an evening.*\\n\\n**Cocaine: 4/10**\\n*As far as stims go I find coke very underwhelming. It’s so short lasting, so I can really only hit that ideal coke vibe for like a few minutes at a time, and the rest of the time I just feel jumpy and a little euphoric. The high isn’t really bad, it’s just inconsistent and when it is good, it’s not THAT great. Decent euphoria, decent energy. Nothing I couldn’t get from a better drug. Plus it’s so fucking expensive, absolutely not worth the price or the crash, which is better than some stims but still not pleasant. Most I’ve done is 1 gram over the course of an evening.*\\n\\n**Adderall: 8/10**\\n*I have a real soft spot for this drug. I had a prescription for a long time before being switched to vyvanse, so I’ve had many great times with these baby blues. The best euphoria of any stim I’ve tried. Makes me very focused and very sociable. When I’m on adderall I feel powerful, like I’m performing at my absolute best. Plus, while the shorter duration might be a downside to some, I feel it makes addy more flexible. I can squeeze in a dose in the early evening and still sleep at a reasonable time. The crash is of course not pleasant, but with some kratom I find it’s absolutely no sweat. Most I’ve ever done is 60mg IR, felt like I could lift a car, couldn’t stop smiling.*\\n\\n**Vyvanse: 8/10**\\n*Honestly just like longer adderall in my opinion. Feels very similar, maybe slightly less euphoric. What it gains in duration it loses in a harsher crash. Most I’ve ever done is 100mg.*\\n\\n**Hydros: 9/10**\\n*The basic bitch opiate. Stronger than codeine and tramadol, weaker than oxy and H. Beautiful, cozy euphoria. Makes all your problems just slip away. Does what an opiate is supposed to do, no more no less. Unfortunately it’s always paired with APAP so you gotta watch out for your liver. A quick CWE though and you’re golden. Most I’ve ever done is 80mg. Fell asleep.*\\n\\n**Tramadol: 7/10**\\n*I actually really like tramadol. A lot of people say it feels synthetic, and it is way more prone to making you itchy. Plus, it’s not very good for you, and it significantly lowers your seizure threshold. That being said, I find the euphoria from trams more energizing, and better suited to being active or social. Most I’ve ever done is 250mg.*\\n\\n**Kratom: 7/10**\\n*A very close friend of mine. The kratom high will never match that of real opiates, but it gets the job done. It’s also very versatile, with low doses and certain strains being very energizing and uplifting. Kratom is great for a quick mood boost or a fat nod. The constant threat of nausea and having to toss and wash bump it down a bit, but it still holds a special place in my heart. Most I’ve ever done is 10 grams. Threw up, felt very hot, wouldn’t recommend.*\\n\\n**Xanax: 6/10**\\n*Xanax is good at what it does. Reduces anxiety, chills you out, nice and cozy. I appreciate it’s disinhibitory qualities, but they aren’t very pronounced at lower, functional doses, and at higher doses the risk of blacking out makes it not worth it in my opinion. I hate blacking out on xans. From what I’ve heard I just get mean and sloppy. It’s eerie, having just a big blank in your memory. I love to use xans with weed, and they are great for aborting a bad trip, but I don’t use them recreationally much any more because eh. Most I’ve ever done is 6mg at once, and another 2mg while blacked out. Came to in the afternoon of the next day, learned that I’d been very belligerent, slightly slurring, and then knocked tf out for about 20 hours.*\\n\\n**Nitrous: 10/10**\\n*Noz is such a handy little drug. It’s fun on its own, but the fact that it synergizes with practically every other drug makes it top tier. It’s like every drug has special Easter egg effects only accessible with nitrous. On its own, it’s a quick blast of euphoria and disso wackiness. On psychs it pumps the visuals up immensely and lets you peek into the more intense aspects of the drug without having to commit to a higher dose. I’ve used nitrous to pop into ego death on L and then slide back down to sanity. Makes euphoric drugs more euphoric. And on dissos? Whew baby. Just make sure you take your B12. Most I’ve ever taken was 4 balloons on LSD. I don’t really remember much after I blasted off.*\\n\\n**Phenibut: 10/10**\\n*Excuse me for playing into the hype. Phenibut effects are often overblown, but honestly, it’s easy to see why. Phenibut is everything alcohol wishes it was. It can be very euphoric, it obliterates all anxiety and, and it is the king of all disinhibitors. The best part of phen though is just the indescribably good mood it puts me in. Hydros, mdma, shrooms, nothing quite matches the contentment I feel on phenibut. With something like MDMA, I feel GREAT, but I also feel high, and the happiness comes mostly from the euphoria. With phenibut, I feel mostly clearheaded, and yet entirely content with who I am and what I’ve done. It’s like what I imagine it feels like to wake up on a beautiful morning, kiss your beautiful spouse, say goodbye to your adorable children, and leave for your perfect job that is both fulfilling and successful. Great for parties, or studying, or relaxing, or being active, or having sex, or literally whatever. Great when paired with kratom. Most I’ve ever done is 3 grams. Come up was kind nauseating, I felt dizzy and kind of hot, but once it settled in, I felt perfect.*\\n\\n**Thats about it. I’ve done a few other drugs, but found them either not unique enough or interesting enough to mention. Some other adhd meds, some RC’s and nootropics.**\\n\\n**TO DO LIST:**\\n\\n*2CB*\\n\\n*DMT*\\n\\n*Salvia*\\n\\n*MDA*\\n\\n*Mescaline (or as close as I can get)*\\n\\n*MXE (pipe dream, I know)*\\n\\n*DPH (because I hate myself)*\\n\\n*Heroin (insufflated)*\\n\\n*Methamphetamine*\\n\\n*Anything else that piques my curiosity*\\n\\n**Edit: formatting.**'"

And I agree, cocaine is bad, and I don’t recommend it for the weak of spirit, but the bell ringers you can get from slamming it...holy shit.',\n",

And so I haven't had hardly any alcohol in my system for about a year until this December, when I drank one pale ale at a meeting with my university's group mates. All I got was cozy numbness which could not compensate for everything ethanol does to one's body/mind.\\n\\nI just say it's possible not to get euphoria, but again I once enjoyed it a lot, but it was more of a social treat, now it's most probably my attitude to it. Which says something, because You can feel worse while drinking because of the attitude, and I don't think it works the same for opiates for example.

Shit was fun and weird the first time; merged and became a stool. Felt like a fatass was sitting on me the whole time. Quit after I tried doing an art project while doing it, and sobered up to urine all over my canvas. 4/10.\\n\\nDMT was my favorite drug ever. After long use of psychedelics I became paranoid from tripping but DMT was the perfect trip. Ego deathed instantly upon hitting but headspace was like hitting nitrous. Kept me from having paranoid thoughts and some intellectual being instantly telling me to calm down and enjoy the ride. Combined with the strong sense of deja vu and insane visuals (far more intense than the time I took 10g of shrooms and smoked some weed). I was in heaven. Though I only broke through to the gateway. I ended up loving it so much I took 5 more 50-70mg hits before I thought to myself that I would be the type of person to actually become addicted to it. Never touched it again. But it was sinfully good. 10/10.\\n\\nI would also recommend adding sass to ur list but it’s really hard to come by.

Fairly relaxing, but not very noticeable at all.\\n\\n**LSD: 7/10.** I love LSD but it lasts too long for me and is a bit too much of a mindfuck. I always feel like I'm jumping around in time and it's a bit too odd.  However, LSD has stimulated amazing ideas for me.  Also music on LSD is unrivaled.\\n\\n**Shrooms: 9.5/10.** Have had my most powerful experience on shrooms. They're easy to cultivate and when done right, I seem to have no nausea. Shrooms have the most gentle come up and come down of any drug I've ever done. I've learned more about myself and others through shrooms. Microdosing has also made me happier all together. My downside is that I get hit with bodyload near the come down and it maintains itself after I'm dons tripping. I typically have tight muscles and get a headache. Nothing some magnesium and Advil can't help with, but it's really what keeps this from being 10/10.\\n\\n**Cocaine: 4/10.** I agree. It's too short lasting and not really that great. When I do coke I tend to just want to do more coke. And that's it. I probably haven't had quality coke, and would try it again if I found some that was better.\\n\\n**MDMA: 8/10.** What an amazing little drug. So much happiness in such a small amount. I will say that I tend to feel an awkward sense of wanting to move and wanting to be sedate with MDMA. Also, the nystagmus and jaw clenching really suck. Magnesium helps, but not quite enough.  What really kills it is how bad the comedown is. It's two full days of feeling useless. Not depressed, but just empty and tired.\\n\\n**2cb: 8.5/10.** Visuals on par with acid and music appreciation that at least gives LSD a run for its money. I haven't quite figured this drug out entirely. Sometimes I have a nice euphoric feeling, but nowhere near the MDMA feeling. I also sometimes get a ton of bodyload. However, even with the downsides of snorting or taking it orally, it is still just a top tier drug. The tolerance is tiny and there's really no residual effects the following days. It's quickly becoming a drug of choice for me, but it seems like cheese in that it goes best paired with something else.\\n\\n\\nMy list of drugs to try:\\n\\n*DMT*\\n\\n*Mescaline*\\n\\n*Ketamine*\\n\\n*4HO-MET*\",\n",

Not always like that, once you piece existence back together it can be better than ever, and it\\'s brilliant for combatting addiction. But you need time to process this drug. You\\'re supposed to take time to process any psychedelic, but this needs 1500x that time.

It\\'s all you thought LSD would be before your first time plus even more of a delve into what seems like the afterlife.\\n\\nSalvia is 1/10\\nNever have I come across such an uncomfortable dissociative.

The only other time I had done drugs before this day was pot, which I tried once (now I’d like to say I’m a pack a day equivalent smoker on pot).\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Being the smart kid I was, I knew that Benadryl could get a person high, so I looked through the medicine cabinet and found 25 pills of Benadryl. I take the box of pills into my room and lock my door. I hop onto skype and open up a group chat with a bunch of my best pals and let them know what I am doing. So at around 7 PM I take the pills 5 at a time with water and tried to relax, to wait and see what awaits for me on the other side.Though when I came to and reread all the messages I had sent throughout the night, I first realized that within the first 3 hours into the trip my messages had degraded significantly.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 From here on out everything gets all fuzzy and I only remember bits and pieces of it. My first memory of the trip was probably an hour and a half into it when I was having a dream of me being in the hospital and talking to a nurse, I would phase in and out of consciousness from this point but no matter what phase I was in, I was physically talking to a nurse that did not exist. I then got anxious for no reason (I was dealing with relationship-induced-anxiety (that’s how I would word it i guess) for a year by this point in my life) over my then-girlfriend and decided to message her mom. At around 9:30ish my vision was still doing okay and I was able to make a coherent message “Hey can I talk to you please?” then I sat down in my desk-chair. My desk is really a white foldable table which has a kind of bumpy texture to it and I would just stare at it. While I would stare at it I noticed these clear little insects which had an orange stripe within (imagine like a marble) manifest out of the texture of my desk and when I looked up, my wall looked all cracked and these little clear spiders just poured out of these cracks by the millions. The part that gets to me to this day is that usually my wall would be 2ish feet away from me when I would sit at my desk, and from the angle I was looking at the wall from, the wall was probably 6-7 feet away from me, but that field of view I was viewing these spiders on my wall from, appeared it was miles away and I was looking at a cracked hellish version of my wall for miles. Was I scared though, no, the spiders had actually kept me company and calmed me from my anxiety. The cottonmouth was hitting pretty bad and I managed to get up and walk downstairs to grab a few water bottles (I did this a lot during the trip) but I stopped at the top of my stairs and walked into my brothers(2 years younger) room. He was playing a game on his laptop and I just started feeling up his walls. I noticed little hairs all over everything and they would move like they were being wistfully blown by the wind. And I just uttered to the best of my ability “Your walls feel fuzzy” and he asked if I was high, I asked why and he said because my voice was slurred, I just said “oh” and walked out with my water and began chugging them when I sat back down. At around 10:20PM I had got a message on my phone from my then-girlfriends mom asking me if everything is okay. My replies from here on out were complete gibberish and for two hours, I harassed this poor woman with utter nonsense until 12:01AM when she messaged me “I am trying to go to sleep. Please stop messaging me. Thanks”. Looking back at it I think my favorite message I sent was “Okay so what happened, i really do love you,\\xa0 Elton |” and my favorite one with some nonsense words “Bur theNever mind that, what happened n the past shoisl, so how elo”. I blame the messages (If people request, I’ll release the full conversation because it gives me a good laugh every now and then) on the blurred vision I was experiencing, which at this point I could not see a foot in front of me without it being blurred into obscurity. I didn’t know what to do so I just went into my bathroom because I wanted to take a shower, but I was interrupted by a person in the mirror, hint it was me, and I ended up just talking with myself for a good half an hour before I got into the shower. While in the shower I was just gazing at all the little spiders that were dangling from my ceiling. When I had gotten out of the shower I had no idea what time it was and I was just staring at my bathroom walls, looking at all the hairs and spiders as if they were one entity, and as if they were two separate entities at the same time. Since I had taken a shower and did not feel the temperature of the water, I was feeling pretty chilly. My mom says that I went downstairs, asked to turn the thermostat up, they said yeah, and I turned the lights off. The only part that I remember from that was my mom asking me if I was high and I just replied with “nah just took a little cough syrup”. I went back upstairs and I sat back down in my chair. I should also mention, I have a huge, irrational fear of stinkbugs. And what would you guess my mind decided to create? A giant, footlong stinkbug with the legs of a daddy-long-legs scurrying across my desk to which I screamed and ran to my bed. I would have to guess it was around 1, maybe 2 AM at this point and I do not remember much after this point. All I can really remember is just being in that state of physically talking while I was talking to someone in my dream, then wake up and still be talking to that person as if they were next to me, then back into another dream talking to someone else.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I do not remember waking up but it was a school day (Friday at this point) and while on the bus to my school I re-read my messages and I reply to my then-girlfriend’s mom “Sorry for what happened, I took a little too much cough medicine.” And she said “oh ok”. Over that weekend and Monday I had a terrible hangover and an unimaginable mental fog that still lingers to this day. Feeling all those spiders on me never bothered me but ever since that trip, I feel like I have insects that crawl on me, it's kind of like a yawn, someone will bring it up, or my mind will think of it and then I need to visually inspect that area before it goes away. All in all, I do not recommend this to anyone, well I mean I guess one time to see what it is like but I feel like that night permanently fried my brain.\",\n",

I’m not sure how much you’ve done, but try 1 gram, see how you feel, and then work your way up by 500mg each time. Many people will tell you not to exceed 2 grams, which isn’t awful advice. Exceeding 2 grams, I get a little dizzy and nauseous on the come up (which for me is between hours 2 and 3 after dosing) but afterwards I have no issues. That could be due to tolerance though, built as well as natural. What you may also want to play around with is staggering. Taking a dose, and then another a few hours later potentiates the second dose and helps avoid all that acidity hitting your stomach at once. My usual dose nowadays is 2g, followed by 1g 2 hours later. It’s really all about finding the right dose for you though, because it’s different for everyone and overdoing it is uncomfortable. Though I wouldn’t be too concerned about hitting your limit, because if you’re incrementing your dose by 500mg each time, you don’t risk overshooting by too much, and unlike some drugs, it’s very easy to sleep off a bad phen experience. Lastly, avoid food 2 hours before and 1 hour after dosing, if at all possible. Good luck!',\n",

       "    'body': 'DXM is Dextromethorphan. It’s used in cough medicine. It’s a powerful dissociative, with the strongest visual/psychedelic effects of any disso. It’s usually seen as a dirty drug mainly used by kids trying to get a legal high, and there’s plenty of truth to that. However, it’s also incredibly unique with a high unlike anything else. My most intense and mind boggling trip out of every drug I’ve tried was on DXM. The big downside is that DXM is usually combined with other chemicals like APAP or guaifenesin, which are unsafe and very unpleasant in high doses, and even medicine with only DXM in it (which is the only kind you should ever take) is usually cut with some nasty filler, such as sugar, that makes you sick in recreational doses.\\n\\nIf you’re interested, make sure you do your research on the effects, the different plateaus, and the proper dosage for a safe trip. r/DXM has tons of great info on the sub and in the sidebar. The cough syrup brand Robocough is generally considered the best way to take DXM short of extracting the chemical and taking it directly.',\n",

       "        'body': 'Go to r/DXM there’s a big FAQ in the sidebar and a lot of other good info.\\n\\nBasically, any cough medicine with only dextromethorphan listed as an active ingredient will be good. Syrups taste nasty but in my anecdotal experience have less filler, while gel caps are gonna be easier to get down but have a higher chance of making you sick on the come up. You can order robocough online and it’s the closest thing you can get to pure, commercially available DXM.\\n\\nGo to [](www.dexcalc.com) and put in your weight to get an estimation of the dosage needed to reach each plateau. I strongly reccomend sticking to the first or second plateau for your first time, the third and fourth and super intense.\\n\\nUnfortunately, it’s pretty likely you’ll get sick/be uncomfortable on the come up. Some people are able to avoid that, but my come ups are always unpleasant, though never unbearable. If the come up is bad, just remember it’ll pass. Once you’ve purged whatever is upsetting your stomach and the DXM has taken hold completely you’ll feel great. I think the resulting high is worth it, but many people disagree.\\n\\nWhen you trip, the best way to experience it is to lay in bed in a completely dark room, put headphones in, and listen to kick ass music. The visuals are only really appreciated in total darkness or with your eyes closed, and the music enhancement on DXM is absolutely incredible.\\n\\nAnother important thing is DXM has a potent afterglow, so the day after you’ll feel a residual high, the strength of which depends on your dose. The afterglow is fantastic, but at higher doses, it can be somewhat disorienting. I’ve definitely done a substantial amount of dex and woken up the next day entirely unfit to drive. Just something to take into consideration.\\n\\nIf you take any kind of amphetamine, or really any stimulant, including coke and mdma, dont take DXM within at least a week, and vise versa. Also don’t take kratom or any other painkiller around the time you’re on the dex. There may be some other bad combos, but I can’t remember off the top of my head, so make sure you check beforehand.\\n\\nAbove all else, be safe, do your research, and use responsibly.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Can you help me figure out why I\\'m losing that awesome feeling with Adderall? FYI I suffer from Social Anxiety and I was able to get legal scripts so these are pharma grade generic Xanax/Addys we are talking about) I only use it twice or sometimes once a week but 20-30 mg. Now the thing is is I combine it was xanax because I heard it\\'s a great combo which it was earlier (I take about .50 - .75 mg) so otherwise just half a bar. It really has depressed me because this is what I used to give me a mood lift for when I actually want to be social or \"shoot\" my shot/flirt with girls.  If you know what I mean. Now I recently introduced taking 1 more Magnesium right before I take addy on top of taking 1 tums tablet because I heard they potentiate the high of Addy. But now I\\'m not to sure, it seemed to have some mild increase of effects but now I might just cut out both and just taking my Magnesium in the mornings/nights like I used to and not use it right before the addy/xannies. It\\'s weird because I read it makes the high even better. I\\'m not sure if I should go back to square one and try 20 mg and just .50 mg xanax with nothing else added or yolo it up to the 40 mg addy and 1mg of xanax. Or just taking Addy by itself? Idk its frustrating because I really need something to mood lift me into wanting to actually start conversation and now it suddenly work less for about 3 hours without a very mild mood lift/no euphoria really. I\\'m stressed out. On the bright side I ordered green colored kratom powdered. Hopefully that helps. Right now if anything the crash is hitting me harder than usual since I\\'m depressed I hardly went up you know. And for 2 hours at best.',\n",

When you’re hitting a vape, you don’t need to be talking, so it’s perfect to fill those terrifying lulls in conversation. Plus, sharing a vape is a quick easy way to make acquaintances and ingratiate yourself.\"  \\nWhy did you start putting nicotine inside the vape in the first place ? What I do is I have my own vape pen too but I just fill it with several tastes of vape without any nicotine on it, just for the sake of vaping with friends and tasting some interesting stuff (like the freezing effect of dragon\\'s fruit juice). I also use it for DMT haha.  \\nThis way you can still socialize with people, but yeah you\\'ll have to tell everyone that\\'s a hard smoker it doesn\\'t contain any nicotine so they won\\'t even bother sharing the vape with you but you can still be there without it being awkward (like non smoker in a smoker area).',\n",

Definitely a win\\n\\n3.MDMA: if it weren't for the three month rule, it'd rank with acid for sure\\n\\n4. Weed: nice cuz it's social and you can use it more regularly\\n\\n5. Hydrocodone: hate the idea of opiates, but they feel molly had a baby \\n\\n6. Adderall: I get sappy as shit on adderall lol. I hate how bad the teeth grinding on this is tho\\n\\n7. 1p-lsd: ik lucy and 1p are supposed to be the same, but there's something about real acid that makes it better\\n\\n8. Nitrous Oxide: underwhelming on its own, but mixed with other drugs... 👀\\n\\n9. Shrooms\\n\\n10. 4-aco-dmt: ik that shrooms and this are supposed to be the same, but there's something about taking real shrooms that just seems more natural/cool. Idk\\n\\n11. Kratom\\n\\n12. DXM: whackest trips I've had have been on DXM. It's the only time I've experienced ego death. Very wonky\\n\\n13. Salvia: WHACK SHIT\\n\\n14. Lorazepam\\n\\n15. Ketamine: I've only tried once, but no euphoria and just kinda weird. Very neutral experience for me\\n\\n16. Alcohol: only good cuz it's legal\\n\\n17. Kava: grosser and higher maintenance alcohol, but less of a body load, which is nice\\n\\n18. Nicotine: kinda shitty drug imo. Nic addictions make no sense to me, especially when there are 100000 other drugs\\n\\n19. Phenibut: the amount of high for the hangover after is not worth it. The music appreciation is nice tho\\n\\n20. LSA: tried twice via HBWS. Once tried 4 seeds with extraction and once 8 seeds without extraction but scraping off the skins. Very nauseating both times. The latter experience had me throwing up in the woods for 4.5 hours feeling like I was living in hell. -1/10 recommend. If you don't get nauseous, It's a cool psych. Mixed with LSD is a yes\",\n",

       " 'jkpt3j': {'text': '**READ THIS IF YOU\\'RE CONSIDERING QUITTING DRUGS OR ARE SAUCED UP AND NEED A DISTRACTION: LONG STORY AHEAD...**\\n\\nHey all, got a long story here, but I just wanted to put my experience out there; skip to bottom if you want the resolution to this tragedy. \\n\\nIt started off with smoking weed in HS with a couple of buddies. It then turned into LSD trips (amazing memories), and a little more weed consumption. I did it here and there, but wasn\\'t a huge fan until senior year/ going onto Freshman in college. I started smoking a ton of weed all day, everyday. It then became cocaine, which really started me down a weird path. I remember visiting my friends back home on breaks, and they would be baffled at the extreme change in personality (with drug use) that I took on. The coke use got a lot heavier, and stayed level with the weed use. \\n\\nTo save even more paragraphs: I have binged almost every drug you could think of, except for meth/ heroin. Think of one, I\\'ve probably done a mass amount. Ketamine (S-Isomer), Codeine, Foils (freebased cocaine, not crack tho even though they\\'re pretty much the same), hydros, oxys, tramadol, Xanax, etc.\\n\\nI then became addicted to blowing things up my nose. It didn\\'t matter the substance; if I could snort it, I was racking up a line. Fast forward through about half a year of everyday coke use, I was introduced to roxycodone (oxycodone 30 mg). I fell in love with opiates (never tried heroin out of fear of knowing myself and the slippery slope it would become, also can\\'t do needles).\\n\\nI was doing 2 pills a day, for the better part of a year (I had 3 months clean during the summer). Come to find out these oxy 30 pills I was buying were actually testing positive for Fentanyl. This didn\\'t stop me, the usage stayed very level, and I always told myself never go above two, and I attribute that to the reason I\\'m able to sit here and share this story. After about a little over two years time of using these awful pills, I decided I value my life and that I am done with them (I\\'ve relapsed one time since vowing to stop). Around the same time, I officially ended my cocaine use, because it slowed down a lot and I realized every time I used it, I felt terrible and it would give me a panic attack.\\n\\nSo then it was only weed in my life, good ol\\' reliable. It was my crutch, I loved smoking bud so much; it was an everyday thing (even when I hit the point of not really getting high anymore, it was still my favorite activity to do with friends, and even when I was home alone). However, the downfall came swiftly and randomly. One night with my girlfriend after an amazing day, I had the worst high experience of my life. It\\'s like i was greening out, but it wasn\\'t a green out. My heart was pounding out of my chest at a scary fast rate, I was forcing myself to throw up (instinctively thinking it would help), and I felt an \"impending doom\" thinking that I was about to just have a heart attack right there and die. After about an hour of going through this, I slowly started to calm down by walking it off, and I went home feeling fine.\\n\\nThe weed use continued though, and I didn\\'t have another experience like this for exactly an entire month. Cue the second heart attack!! This time I was aware of what smoking too much weed could possibly do to me, however I still took one too many dabs. The same exact thing happened to me as the first experience, except I pretty much blacked out in this experience for 3 hours this time, even though it only felt like an hour or so (I was conscious the entire time, but my concept of time was out the window). Ever since this night weed has never been the same. I cut back to smoking my hash pen only once a day, and then getting an awful feeling of anxiety, shakes, racing heart, and a faint numbness in my arm. I then went down a loophole of believing that all of my drug use had finally caught up to me, and I developed some kind of heart disease. I had to stop smoking entirely because the fear I would get of an impending heart attack every time I smoked was just too much to handle.I was thinking maybe a T-Break would help the boy.\\n\\nHere I am now. I smoked for the first time in over a month, a tiny amount and I got the same panicky feeling I was getting as before. So now I am thinking it\\'s really time to end this chapter of my life, and start fresh.\\n\\nReflecting on my past experiences, I am lucky to be alive today. I know many friends who went down a similar path and lost their lives to these stupid drugs (**not weed**, just the opiates or fetti cut cocaine). Being crispy as hell right now has really made me ponder the losses that I had because of my drug use. The money, the time, the experiences. Thinking about the lies I have told to hide my problem from not only my friends but my family as well. Telling myself that it was just me trying to have a good time, denying the fact that I had developed a serious issue. \\n\\nIt\\'s gross to think about the person that I was not too long ago. I was an enthusiast, I loved trying new drugs, binging them, sharing them, facilitating, everything. I loved being high. No matter what it was off of. But now I just feel a sense of disgust and sadness. \\n\\nI have gone to the doctor and I am 100% healthy, all of my blood tests came back in tip-top condition, to my surprise; and the **month of being sober off weed** (and the almost year that I\\'ve been off the hard drugs), has been the **best time I\\'ve had in a really long time**. This experience tonight, off of the one toke, has really solidified that maybe it is time to officially give everything up. \\n\\nI want this message to be taken away: Everything should be done in moderation. \\n\\nI\\'m not knocking the fact that drugs have given me some amazing experiences, and that I\\'ve made memories that\\'ll last a life time (good or bad). However, looking back on it, I wish that I had made different decisions with my life, and where I\\'d be at today had I not become an addict.\\n\\nEveryone should have their own opinion so in no way should this deter you from trying drugs. But just exercise responsibility, it might just save your life (and a lot of money, I\\'m talking thousands). Appreciate the life that you\\'ve been given and understand that you don\\'t need drugs to do everything, or to make anything better.\\n\\nI am now going to continue down a sober path, and I want everyone who\\'s thinking of quitting, to try it out and stick to it (I know withdrawals blow ass). You might be surprised with your new found appreciation of life.\\n\\nTake care of yourself yall.',\n",
