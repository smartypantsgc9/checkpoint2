{"drtd3n": {"text": "**NOTE: 5/10 is AVERAGE on my scale. Anything above is considered overall a worthwhile drug while anything below is something who\u2019s flaws outweigh the benefits.**\n\n**Alcohol: GARBAGE/10**\n*It\u2019s always blown my mind that alcohol is society\u2019s drug of choice. Maybe I\u2019m just spoiled by superior substances, but even some of the most experienced druggies I know still get drunk on the regular. Euphoria essentially nonexistent. Makes you tired, stupid, and sick. The biggest draw is it\u2019s disinhibitory properties, which are moderate at best compared sexy alpha drugs like phenibut, benzos, mdma, etc. Plus, it makes you feel like a literal pile of shit the next morning. If there\u2019s any diehard alcoholics reading this, please, give your best defense in the comments. Most I\u2019ve ever drank was 12 shots. Threw up a bunch, felt like shit the next day. Disgusting.*\n\n**Caffeine: 7/10**\n*The everyman\u2019s stim. In contrast to alcohol, I can definitely see why this is also society\u2019s drug of choice. A nice, brief blast of focus and energy, a surprising amount of euphoria, and pretty forgiving when abused. I hate coffee so I use caffeine pills. I have ADHD and the caffeine legitimately treats my symptoms to a small extent. Also great to pair with downers, as it boosts euphoria and keeps you awake without being overpowering. Most I\u2019ve ever taken is 10 200mg pills, would not recommend. When it all hit at once I was so over stimulated I cried.*\n\n**Nicotine: 2/10**\n*In my opinion, probably the lamest drug ever. I don\u2019t really have any beef with nicotine like I do with alcohol, it\u2019s just a pathetic drug. The \u201cbuzz\u201d is... I don\u2019t even know what it is. Kind of stimulating. Kind of sedating. Goes from meh to unpleasant very quickly if you over do it. Best thing I can say about it is it\u2019s nice on other substances, especially psychs and stims, for whatever reason. All that being said, this is easily the drug I do the most. Oops. I started vaping as a social crutch. When you\u2019re hitting a vape, you don\u2019t need to be talking, so it\u2019s perfect to fill those terrifying lulls in conversation. Plus, sharing a vape is a quick easy way to make acquaintances and ingratiate yourself. It\u2019s a very hard habit to kick, and I\u2019ve not much motivation to do so, but if I could go back and decide not to get addicted I would definitely do so, given the health risks.*\n\n**Weed: 6/10**\n*This one is hard, because a couple years ago, weed would\u2019ve been an easy 10 for me. Weed at its best is a dream drug. Euphoric. Energizing or sedating depending on the strain. Enhances every aspect of life: music sounds better, movies and tv are more captivating, food tastes better, everything is just more beautiful. All that, combined with minimal health risks? Hell yeah. Unfortunately, at a certain point weed changed for me. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s from overuse or from doing psychs, as I\u2019ve heard both can cause this. It\u2019s not as bad for me as I\u2019ve heard it is for some people, I can still enjoy being high, but it\u2019s become more like a lowkey psych, which might sound great to some people but that\u2019s not the vibe I want when I smoke. It\u2019s not as cozy or sedating, instead being way more visual and stimulating, with a higher chance to make me anxious as the headspace is way more psychedelic as opposed to just kinda hazy. Most I\u2019ve ever done is a 50 mg edible. I\u2019ve probably smoked more than that THC wise but that\u2019s hard to keep track of. 50mg ingested was practically a psychedelic experience, very euphoric, and the peak was very close to being overwhelming. After it peaked though I felt FANTASTIC. Edibles are now my favorite way to do THC as the cozy body high is still there.*\n\n**DXM: 7/10**\n*I\u2019ve got a love hate relationship with this drug. I am prone to getting nauseous and anxious on the come up of most drugs, and on DXM it\u2019s especially brutal. I throw up 100% without fail on the come up, and generally just feel like complete trash. Sometimes, it\u2019s so bad that it ruins the whole trip, and a bad DXM trip is not fun. But man, when it\u2019s good, it\u2019s goooood. The psych/disso/downer high is unlike anything else, and I\u2019ve had my best drug experiences on dex. Extremely euphoric. Music is amazing. Visuals are amazing. Disso headspace is amazing. Afterglow is amazing. If I could consistently recreate a good DXM trip I would never do anything else. Most I\u2019ve ever done is 600mg. I hit a low 3rd plateau and that remains to this day my most intense, mind blowing experience with any drug. I never robotrip without weed to smooth out the harshness, boost visuals, and reduce nausea.*\n\n**LSD: 6/10**\n*Not much to say about acid that hasn\u2019t been said already. Can be very fun, but given it\u2019s exhausting duration and stimulating body load I find myself more prone to anxiety on acid than on some other psychs. I find the secret to a good acid trip is to have a plan. Even if your plan is to just lay around, listen to music, and watch trippy shit. Every time I take acid on a whim, even if my set and setting are great, I find myself getting bored and antsy. I also hate tripping in groups bigger than 2 or 3 at the most, and only with people I\u2019m very comfortable with. I exclusively trip with phenibut now, to reduce anxiety and that overall stimmy feeling. Most I\u2019ve ever done is 300ug and I\u2019m fine with never doing more. Ego death on acid does not sound appealing to me.*\n\n**Shrooms: 8/10**\n*Shrooms are way more my speed than acid. Shorter, less energizing, more natural body load, generally much better for what I like to do when I\u2019m tripping, which is just lay around and soak in it. It\u2019s a cozier, more joyful euphoria, as opposed to the speedy, synthetic euphoria from acid. Really the only downsides of shrooms are the greater risk of nausea and the deeper headspace. Most I\u2019ve ever done was 4 grams, had an incredible trip. No anxiety, beautiful visuals, I felt at peace and in love with the world. Interestingly, my worst ever trip was on shrooms. It\u2019s my fault for being irresponsible with set and setting. I did 2 grams and smoked a ton before going to see Spider Man: Into the Spiderverse. I didn\u2019t tell the people I was with and I was completely taken aback by the trips intensity. I circled the drain on ego death, constantly forgetting and remembering who I was and where I was. In addition to the nausea and complete overstimulation from the move, I had a full blown panic attack and left the theater.*\n\n**MDMA: 9/10**\n*I\u2019ve had nothing but incredible experiences from mdma. Again, I don\u2019t exactly have a unique perspective on this drug. Amazing euphoria. Amazing, loving headspace. Music and tactile sensations, amazing. I always feel like I\u2019m exactly where I\u2019m supposed to be. I\u2019ve kept all trips 3 months apart, and I credit that to preserving the magic. Most I\u2019ve ever done is 120mg of pure crystal in capsules.*\n\n**Ketamine: 6/10**\n*I have very limited experience with ket, having only done it a handful of times. I like the disso headspace, and the blissful, comfy body high, but after DXM I was kind of underwhelmed. I haven\u2019t tried to hole, and I haven\u2019t mixed with any other substances, so I suspect that I\u2019m missing the real potential of this drug. Most I\u2019ve ever done is 100mg insufflated over the course of an evening.*\n\n**Cocaine: 4/10**\n*As far as stims go I find coke very underwhelming. It\u2019s so short lasting, so I can really only hit that ideal coke vibe for like a few minutes at a time, and the rest of the time I just feel jumpy and a little euphoric. The high isn\u2019t really bad, it\u2019s just inconsistent and when it is good, it\u2019s not THAT great. Decent euphoria, decent energy. Nothing I couldn\u2019t get from a better drug. Plus it\u2019s so fucking expensive, absolutely not worth the price or the crash, which is better than some stims but still not pleasant. Most I\u2019ve done is 1 gram over the course of an evening.*\n\n**Adderall: 8/10**\n*I have a real soft spot for this drug. I had a prescription for a long time before being switched to vyvanse, so I\u2019ve had many great times with these baby blues. The best euphoria of any stim I\u2019ve tried. Makes me very focused and very sociable. When I\u2019m on adderall I feel powerful, like I\u2019m performing at my absolute best. Plus, while the shorter duration might be a downside to some, I feel it makes addy more flexible. I can squeeze in a dose in the early evening and still sleep at a reasonable time. The crash is of course not pleasant, but with some kratom I find it\u2019s absolutely no sweat. Most I\u2019ve ever done is 60mg IR, felt like I could lift a car, couldn\u2019t stop smiling.*\n\n**Vyvanse: 8/10**\n*Honestly just like longer adderall in my opinion. Feels very similar, maybe slightly less euphoric. What it gains in duration it loses in a harsher crash. Most I\u2019ve ever done is 100mg.*\n\n**Hydros: 9/10**\n*The basic bitch opiate. Stronger than codeine and tramadol, weaker than oxy and H. Beautiful, cozy euphoria. Makes all your problems just slip away. Does what an opiate is supposed to do, no more no less. Unfortunately it\u2019s always paired with APAP so you gotta watch out for your liver. A quick CWE though and you\u2019re golden. Most I\u2019ve ever done is 80mg. Fell asleep.*\n\n**Tramadol: 7/10**\n*I actually really like tramadol. A lot of people say it feels synthetic, and it is way more prone to making you itchy. Plus, it\u2019s not very good for you, and it significantly lowers your seizure threshold. That being said, I find the euphoria from trams more energizing, and better suited to being active or social. Most I\u2019ve ever done is 250mg.*\n\n**Kratom: 7/10**\n*A very close friend of mine. The kratom high will never match that of real opiates, but it gets the job done. It\u2019s also very versatile, with low doses and certain strains being very energizing and uplifting. Kratom is great for a quick mood boost or a fat nod. The constant threat of nausea and having to toss and wash bump it down a bit, but it still holds a special place in my heart. Most I\u2019ve ever done is 10 grams. Threw up, felt very hot, wouldn\u2019t recommend.*\n\n**Xanax: 6/10**\n*Xanax is good at what it does. Reduces anxiety, chills you out, nice and cozy. I appreciate it\u2019s disinhibitory qualities, but they aren\u2019t very pronounced at lower, functional doses, and at higher doses the risk of blacking out makes it not worth it in my opinion. I hate blacking out on xans. From what I\u2019ve heard I just get mean and sloppy. It\u2019s eerie, having just a big blank in your memory. I love to use xans with weed, and they are great for aborting a bad trip, but I don\u2019t use them recreationally much any more because eh. Most I\u2019ve ever done is 6mg at once, and another 2mg while blacked out. Came to in the afternoon of the next day, learned that I\u2019d been very belligerent, slightly slurring, and then knocked tf out for about 20 hours.*\n\n**Nitrous: 10/10**\n*Noz is such a handy little drug. It\u2019s fun on its own, but the fact that it synergizes with practically every other drug makes it top tier. It\u2019s like every drug has special Easter egg effects only accessible with nitrous. On its own, it\u2019s a quick blast of euphoria and disso wackiness. On psychs it pumps the visuals up immensely and lets you peek into the more intense aspects of the drug without having to commit to a higher dose. I\u2019ve used nitrous to pop into ego death on L and then slide back down to sanity. Makes euphoric drugs more euphoric. And on dissos? Whew baby. Just make sure you take your B12. Most I\u2019ve ever taken was 4 balloons on LSD. I don\u2019t really remember much after I blasted off.*\n\n**Phenibut: 10/10**\n*Excuse me for playing into the hype. Phenibut effects are often overblown, but honestly, it\u2019s easy to see why. Phenibut is everything alcohol wishes it was. It can be very euphoric, it obliterates all anxiety and, and it is the king of all disinhibitors. The best part of phen though is just the indescribably good mood it puts me in. Hydros, mdma, shrooms, nothing quite matches the contentment I feel on phenibut. With something like MDMA, I feel GREAT, but I also feel high, and the happiness comes mostly from the euphoria. With phenibut, I feel mostly clearheaded, and yet entirely content with who I am and what I\u2019ve done. It\u2019s like what I imagine it feels like to wake up on a beautiful morning, kiss your beautiful spouse, say goodbye to your adorable children, and leave for your perfect job that is both fulfilling and successful. Great for parties, or studying, or relaxing, or being active, or having sex, or literally whatever. Great when paired with kratom. Most I\u2019ve ever done is 3 grams. Come up was kind nauseating, I felt dizzy and kind of hot, but once it settled in, I felt perfect.*\n\n**Thats about it. I\u2019ve done a few other drugs, but found them either not unique enough or interesting enough to mention. Some other adhd meds, some RC\u2019s and nootropics.**\n\n**TO DO LIST:**\n\n*2CB*\n\n*DMT*\n\n*Salvia*\n\n*MDA*\n\n*Mescaline (or as close as I can get)*\n\n*MXE (pipe dream, I know)*\n\n*DPH (because I hate myself)*\n\n*Heroin (insufflated)*\n\n*Methamphetamine*\n\n*Anything else that piques my curiosity*\n\n**Edit: formatting.**", "author": "Luturtle", "score": 1463, "flair": null, "created": 1572952834.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/drtd3n/here_comes_another_drug_ranking_every_drug_ive/", "num_comments": 594, "title": "Here comes another drug ranking!

Great for keeping you awake when you need it, but it makes me anxious and constantly have to pee. Also affects my sleep cycle no matter when in the day I take it. Plus I abused this as a teenager and my tolerance has remained high. \n\n**Nicotine: 5/10.** Just feels nice. But, too much feels shitty. \n\n**Weed: 2/10.** Used to be more of an 8/10, but now I get anxious and stupid. It just slows me down and makes me lazy and it also affects my sleep. I can't dream if I've smoked that day. \n\nAs a side note, CBD is more like a 6/10. Fairly relaxing, but not very noticeable at all.\n\n**LSD: 7/10.** I love LSD but it lasts too long for me and is a bit too much of a mindfuck. I always feel like I'm jumping around in time and it's a bit too odd.  However, LSD has stimulated amazing ideas for me.  Also music on LSD is unrivaled.\n\n**Shrooms: 9.5/10.** Have had my most powerful experience on shrooms. They're easy to cultivate and when done right, I seem to have no nausea. Shrooms have the most gentle come up and come down of any drug I've ever done. I've learned more about myself and others through shrooms. Microdosing has also made me happier all together. My downside is that I get hit with bodyload near the come down and it maintains itself after I'm dons tripping. I typically have tight muscles and get a headache. Nothing some magnesium and Advil can't help with, but it's really what keeps this from being 10/10.\n\n**Cocaine: 4/10.** I agree. It's too short lasting and not really that great. When I do coke I tend to just want to do more coke. And that's it. I probably haven't had quality coke, and would try it again if I found some that was better.\n\n**MDMA: 8/10.** What an amazing little drug. So much happiness in such a small amount. I will say that I tend to feel an awkward sense of wanting to move and wanting to be sedate with MDMA. Also, the nystagmus and jaw clenching really suck. Magnesium helps, but not quite enough.  What really kills it is how bad the comedown is. It's two full days of feeling useless. Not depressed, but just empty and tired.\n\n**2cb: 8.5/10.** Visuals on par with acid and music appreciation that at least gives LSD a run for its money. I haven't quite figured this drug out entirely. Sometimes I have a nice euphoric feeling, but nowhere near the MDMA feeling. I also sometimes get a ton of bodyload. However, even with the downsides of snorting or taking it orally, it is still just a top tier drug. The tolerance is tiny and there's really no residual effects the following days. It's quickly becoming a drug of choice for me, but it seems like cheese in that it goes best paired with something else.\n\n\nMy list of drugs to try:\n\n*DMT*\n\n*Mescaline*\n\n*Ketamine*\n\n*4HO-MET*", "replies": {}}, "f6m2zna": {"score": 4, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/drtd3n/here_comes_another_drug_ranking_every_drug_ive/f6m2zna/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1572994621.0, "body": "*saves post* \ud83d\udc40 thanks for making this, so helpful", "replies": {}}, "f6mq831": {"score": 5, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/drtd3n/here_comes_another_drug_ranking_every_drug_ive/f6mq831/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1573005624.0, "body": "\"LSD 6/10\"\n\nAnnd I'm out", "replies": {}}, "f6lf0id": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/drtd3n/here_comes_another_drug_ranking_every_drug_ive/f6lf0id/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1572970125.0, "body": "[deleted]", "replies": {"f6ln9me": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/drtd3n/here_comes_another_drug_ranking_every_drug_ive/f6ln9me/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1572982822.0, "body": "It is counter intuitive, but simulants are effective if you actually have adhd", "replies": {}}}}, "f6lfp6p": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/drtd3n/here_comes_another_drug_ranking_every_drug_ive/f6lfp6p/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1572971145.0, "body": "I don't get the hydro hype, I just become tired, itchy, and pissed off the whole time.

I take the box of pills into my room and lock my door. I hop onto skype and open up a group chat with a bunch of my best pals and let them know what I am doing. So at around 7 PM I take the pills 5 at a time with water and tried to relax, to wait and see what awaits for me on the other side.Though when I came to and reread all the messages I had sent throughout the night, I first realized that within the first 3 hours into the trip my messages had degraded significantly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From here on out everything gets all fuzzy and I only remember bits and pieces of it. My first memory of the trip was probably an hour and a half into it when I was having a dream of me being in the hospital and talking to a nurse, I would phase in and out of consciousness from this point but no matter what phase I was in, I was physically talking to a nurse that did not exist. I then got anxious for no reason (I was dealing with relationship-induced-anxiety (that\u2019s how I would word it i guess) for a year by this point in my life) over my then-girlfriend and decided to message her mom. At around 9:30ish my vision was still doing okay and I was able to make a coherent message \u201cHey can I talk to you please?\u201d then I sat down in my desk-chair. My desk is really a white foldable table which has a kind of bumpy texture to it and I would just stare at it. While I would stare at it I noticed these clear little insects which had an orange stripe within (imagine like a marble) manifest out of the texture of my desk and when I looked up, my wall looked all cracked and these little clear spiders just poured out of these cracks by the millions. The part that gets to me to this day is that usually my wall would be 2ish feet away from me when I would sit at my desk, and from the angle I was looking at the wall from, the wall was probably 6-7 feet away from me, but that field of view I was viewing these spiders on my wall from, appeared it was miles away and I was looking at a cracked hellish version of my wall for miles. Was I scared though, no, the spiders had actually kept me company and calmed me from my anxiety. The cottonmouth was hitting pretty bad and I managed to get up and walk downstairs to grab a few water bottles (I did this a lot during the trip) but I stopped at the top of my stairs and walked into my brothers(2 years younger) room. He was playing a game on his laptop and I just started feeling up his walls. I noticed little hairs all over everything and they would move like they were being wistfully blown by the wind. And I just uttered to the best of my ability \u201cYour walls feel fuzzy\u201d and he asked if I was high, I asked why and he said because my voice was slurred, I just said \u201coh\u201d and walked out with my water and began chugging them when I sat back down. At around 10:20PM I had got a message on my phone from my then-girlfriends mom asking me if everything is okay. My replies from here on out were complete gibberish and for two hours, I harassed this poor woman with utter nonsense until 12:01AM when she messaged me \u201cI am trying to go to sleep. Please stop messaging me. Thanks\u201d. Looking back at it I think my favorite message I sent was \u201cOkay so what happened, i really do love you,\u00a0 Elton |\u201d and my favorite one with some nonsense words \u201cBur theNever mind that, what happened n the past shoisl, so how elo\u201d. I blame the messages (If people request, I\u2019ll release the full conversation because it gives me a good laugh every now and then) on the blurred vision I was experiencing, which at this point I could not see a foot in front of me without it being blurred into obscurity. I didn\u2019t know what to do so I just went into my bathroom because I wanted to take a shower, but I was interrupted by a person in the mirror, hint it was me, and I ended up just talking with myself for a good half an hour before I got into the shower. While in the shower I was just gazing at all the little spiders that were dangling from my ceiling. When I had gotten out of the shower I had no idea what time it was and I was just staring at my bathroom walls, looking at all the hairs and spiders as if they were one entity, and as if they were two separate entities at the same time. Since I had taken a shower and did not feel the temperature of the water, I was feeling pretty chilly. My mom says that I went downstairs, asked to turn the thermostat up, they said yeah, and I turned the lights off. The only part that I remember from that was my mom asking me if I was high and I just replied with \u201cnah just took a little cough syrup\u201d. I went back upstairs and I sat back down in my chair. I should also mention, I have a huge, irrational fear of stinkbugs. And what would you guess my mind decided to create? A giant, footlong stinkbug with the legs of a daddy-long-legs scurrying across my desk to which I screamed and ran to my bed. I would have to guess it was around 1, maybe 2 AM at this point and I do not remember much after this point. All I can really remember is just being in that state of physically talking while I was talking to someone in my dream, then wake up and still be talking to that person as if they were next to me, then back into another dream talking to someone else.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I do not remember waking up but it was a school day (Friday at this point) and while on the bus to my school I re-read my messages and I reply to my then-girlfriend\u2019s mom \u201cSorry for what happened, I took a little too much cough medicine.\u201d And she said \u201coh ok\u201d. Over that weekend and Monday I had a terrible hangover and an unimaginable mental fog that still lingers to this day. Feeling all those spiders on me never bothered me but ever since that trip, I feel like I have insects that crawl on me, it's kind of like a yawn, someone will bring it up, or my mind will think of it and then I need to visually inspect that area before it goes away. All in all, I do not recommend this to anyone, well I mean I guess one time to see what it is like but I feel like that night permanently fried my brain.", "replies": {}}, "f6lukvf": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/drtd3n/here_comes_another_drug_ranking_every_drug_ive/f6lukvf/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1572990086.0, "body": "> .

It's next to impossible to find, but it's so easy and cheap to make yourself so I'd recommend going that route.\n\nSalvia is fucking fun. My recommendation is to get a bunch of 10x with friends, everyone gets their own bowl and hits it at the same time. My first trip was very confusing, I had actually forgotten I took a hit haha. After that, it's just a 5 minute laughing fit. The best.\n\nHeroin is also on my to do list, but I have a fear of fentanyl. I'm good on that.\n\nMeth is a stim from another world. I love and hate it. It's a cheaper addie that lasts as long as LSD and you feel absolutely incredible and warm all over. You can forget about sleeping and eating for the next 48 hours because neither of those will be doable. You're just gonna be walking around hungry as fuck without even a sliver of an appetite.

It\u2019s used in cough medicine. It\u2019s a powerful dissociative, with the strongest visual/psychedelic effects of any disso.

However, it\u2019s also incredibly unique with a high unlike anything else. My most intense and mind boggling trip out of every drug I\u2019ve tried was on DXM.

You can order robocough online and it\u2019s the closest thing you can get to pure, commercially available DXM.\n\nGo to [](www.dexcalc.com) and put in your weight to get an estimation of the dosage needed to reach each plateau. I strongly reccomend sticking to the first or second plateau for your first time, the third and fourth and super intense.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s pretty likely you\u2019ll get sick/be uncomfortable on the come up. Some people are able to avoid that, but my come ups are always unpleasant, though never unbearable. If the come up is bad, just remember it\u2019ll pass. Once you\u2019ve purged whatever is upsetting your stomach and the DXM has taken hold completely you\u2019ll feel great. I think the resulting high is worth it, but many people disagree.\n\nWhen you trip, the best way to experience it is to lay in bed in a completely dark room, put headphones in, and listen to kick ass music. The visuals are only really appreciated in total darkness or with your eyes closed, and the music enhancement on DXM is absolutely incredible.\n\nAnother important thing is DXM has a potent afterglow, so the day after you\u2019ll feel a residual high, the strength of which depends on your dose. The afterglow is fantastic, but at higher doses, it can be somewhat disorienting. I\u2019ve definitely done a substantial amount of dex and woken up the next day entirely unfit to drive. Just something to take into consideration.\n\nIf you take any kind of amphetamine, or really any stimulant, including coke and mdma, dont take DXM within at least a week, and vise versa. Also don\u2019t take kratom or any other painkiller around the time you\u2019re on the dex.

Now the thing is is I combine it was xanax because I heard it's a great combo which it was earlier (I take about .50 - .75 mg) so otherwise just half a bar.

But now I'm not to sure, it seemed to have some mild increase of effects but now I might just cut out both and just taking my Magnesium in the mornings/nights like I used to and not use it right before the addy/xannies. It's weird because I read it makes the high even better. I'm not sure if I should go back to square one and try 20 mg and just .50 mg xanax with nothing else added or yolo it up to the 40 mg addy and 1mg of xanax. Or just taking Addy by itself?

Definitely a win\n\n3.MDMA: if it weren't for the three month rule, it'd rank with acid for sure\n\n4. Weed: nice cuz it's social and you can use it more regularly\n\n5. Hydrocodone: hate the idea of opiates, but they feel molly had a baby \n\n6. Adderall: I get sappy as shit on adderall lol. I hate how bad the teeth grinding on this is tho\n\n7. 1p-lsd: ik lucy and 1p are supposed to be the same, but there's something about real acid that makes it better\n\n8. Nitrous Oxide: underwhelming on its own, but mixed with other drugs... \ud83d\udc40\n\n9. Shrooms\n\n10. 4-aco-dmt: ik that shrooms and this are supposed to be the same, but there's something about taking real shrooms that just seems more natural/cool. Idk\n\n11. Kratom\n\n12. DXM: whackest trips I've had have been on DXM. It's the only time I've experienced ego death. Very wonky\n\n13. Salvia: WHACK SHIT\n\n14. Lorazepam\n\n15. Ketamine: I've only tried once, but no euphoria and just kinda weird. Very neutral experience for me\n\n16. Alcohol: only good cuz it's legal\n\n17. Kava: grosser and higher maintenance alcohol, but less of a body load, which is nice\n\n18. Nicotine: kinda shitty drug imo. Nic addictions make no sense to me, especially when there are 100000 other drugs\n\n19. Phenibut: the amount of high for the hangover after is not worth it. The music appreciation is nice tho\n\n20. LSA: tried twice via HBWS. Once tried 4 seeds with extraction and once 8 seeds without extraction but scraping off the skins. Very nauseating both times.

I had no knowledge of drugs or addiction. I smoked pot once and had a horrible experience but other than that I had no desire to do any other drugs. However when I was 14 I had a kidney stone which was very strange for someone my age, but they prescribed me HELLA pills. My first script was for 50 Hydro 10s.... \n\nNow I never had any pain from my kidney stone (ended up being because it wasn\u2019t passing thru my kidney) so I never had a use for the painkillers. Although I had migraines every now and again and I thought hey maybe I could take these for that, they\u2019d work for this right ?\n\nHoly hell did they work. Jesus Christ that first time was amazing. Looking back now I have no clue how one Hydro 10 fucked me as much as it did but it did. I slowly but surely started taking them more and more frequently. In the span of a month I had used 75% of the script.(still not at all aware of slipping into addiction)\n\nEventually I was taking it once a day and I had bumped it up to 2 pills so I ran out rather quickly. When I did run out that\u2019s when I realized I might\u2019ve made a mistake. I was super anxious and really wanted to take some more. I started rummaging through our med cabinet anxiously searching up all the scripts on pill ID sites to see if there were any painkillers.\n\nLo and behold I found a bottle of oxy and another 2 bottles of Hydros. The oxys were over 5 years old and in the back of the cabinet so I didn\u2019t worry about my parents finding out but the hydros were a script written to my mom. I knew if she found it she\u2019d know something was up, but that didn\u2019t stop me. I instantly with out any thought fell right back into my original routine. \n\nI ran out the hydros rather quickly but was scared to try the oxys cause I didn\u2019t really know how much or if it was the same as what I was used to. I started googling to find the safest way to take em. I ended up on r/opiates ... that\u2019s where i found out about the true horror of the shit I had been taking daily for a months. I read about people struggling with addiction people needing 5 times how much I was dosing just to get a buzz, the often gateway to heroin.\n\nIt scared the hell out of me. But it didn\u2019t stop me. I fell right back into the same routine for about 4 months randomly upping my dose when I felt the affects weaken, the only difference now was I knew what I was doing to myself, but I didn\u2019t care I just wanted to feel good. \n\nEventually I ran out completely. I scoured every inch of the house looking for anything. Thank god I live in the most rural ass part of the South where tryna find a dealer with painkillers would\u2019ve been impossible. But when I found nothing i fell into the deepest depression I ever had. And I\u2019m still struggling to crawl out years later. This drug had ruined my daily life for probably a year after \u201cquitting\u201d\n\nI still every now and then have opportunities to take painkillers and I very often take them(to my own disappointment) but I definitely don\u2019t struggle with it much anymore.

Your story sounds almost like a carbon copy of my experience. Almost exactly the same. I had my wisdom teeth pulled in 2012 when I was a freshman in HS and they gave me a script of some pretty mediocre opiates, but then eventually I got a migraine and my mother offered me a (much much stronger) script that she had when she got her hip replaced. I took it not thinking anything of it because I had taken the script before, I just didn't know it was so much stronger. That night I felt an overwhelming sense of well being. I was playing games with my friends online and I felt so close to them. I loved them, and I love the game I was playing.\n\nAfter that one incident I did the same. I looked around the house and found a plethora of painkillers from the past. I found multiple bottles of Hydrocodone, Tramadol, Oxycodone... You name it, It was probably there. I took all these bottles and would use them every night. Eventually I started using them before school because I was edgy and hated high school. It helped me tolerate my classes throughout the year. I ended up sharing them with one of my close friends and we would get high in english class. The first time he did it he thought it was pointless and it couldn't feel that good but then as soon as it kicked in he realized what it actually felt like. We would split the drugs 50/50 and do them in class like I said. Eventually I ran out and started looking for Oxy on the deep web, asking friends, asking friends of friends too.\n\nYour story mirrors mine all the way down to looking for more drugs and having a feeling of dread when there were no more. I got desperate and even 2 years later I was STILL checking in my parent's room for any I might have possibly missed. It really just goes to show how easy it is for children to fall into this trap.

I have experienced enough disappointment in the past to now be certain there is more to come. Because I had no power over my wretched self and the things that happened in the past, I never will. As such, I will do whatever I can to just find a way to drift by as my life passes and then I finally experience my uneventful death.

Until you have seen it eat like an acid through  everything you are. It is astounding to watch. Its slow and total  corrosion of your entire life is mesmerizing. As you watch it, you keep  thinking, \"At some point, the corrosion will stop. There is no way it  will be able to eat through this next thing. This next thing is too  important to me.\" But then it does. It eats through everything. And you  realize you are dealing with a vast and inhuman power.\n\nThe most frightening thing is that consequences do not work against a  well-developed addiction. There are ultimately no consequences, none,  which can separate you from your drug. As your addiction progresses and  your self-control slips away, there is nothing you won't risk to  continue doing your drug. Nothing is important enough. Nothing is sacred  enough.\n\nMoney. Career. Marriage. Home. Family. Goals. Art. Religion. Dignity.  Safety. Health. Sanity. Parents. Children. Life Itself. All of it will  go into play. All of it will be put on the table. If you play the game  shrewdly, you might get to keep some of it. You will not get to keep all  of it. You will pay. You will pay in ways that you cannot imagine.\n\nYou will look at the people who have lost more than you, and you will  pretend you are different than them. You will pretend that you can walk  away from the table. But the time will come to walk away, and you  won't. You will keep playing. You will be made a liar. If you play long  enough, all your pious little promises will be shown to be lies.\n\n\"I have a good job. I would never risk my job.\"\n\n\"I love my wife. I would never risk my marriage.\"\n\n\"I love my children more than anything. I would never risk my children's safety. Ever.\" \"I don't want to die.\"\n\nWhatever specific promises you make will be the ones that you will  break, because those are the ones you have made to try to control  yourself. But you won't be able to control yourself. Your self-control  will be pried from your grasp like a toy being taken away from a child.\n\nAnd when break these promises, you will not be some mindless \"junkie\"  who doesn't care anymore. You will be in many ways the same person you  are now, and you will know how awful and horrifying your actions are,  and you will do them anyway. You will not be able to believe what is  happening to you. You will tell yourself that you are unlucky or cursed.  You will watch in horror. But what you are watching is yourself. The  horror is what you are doing.\n\nI realize that this all sounds rather silly and dramatic. From the  perspective of somebody dabbling with drugs, this all sounds laughably  overwrought.

Theres a variety of types and when it comes to specific drugs theres a headspinningly massive amount out there.

Take whatever precautions you can/want to protect your info i dont need the exact city or even state. \n\nTo start Ill say Im from the south eastern region of the united states and what I see being used the most often is opioid pills and meth. The meth is fairly obvious as to why its common, we have plenty of back country to get and produce it, and id assume a lot of the use stems from a need for stimulants after being overprescribed adderall (which is also incredibly common here) from a young age. \n\nAs for opioids its not as common to see heroin or fentanyl here as it is to see hydros or other pills. Idk why that is in particular maybe it stems from a massive over-prescribing of medication resulting in an overabundance of supply, or some other reason i dont know about, but its by far the most common usage i see. something else I find interesting is when I lived in the middle east the most common drug I would come across is steroids of all things! alcohol is illegal and there isnt a huge attitude about getting inebriated there so the biggest driving factor that would result in drug use was vanity, hence the steroids. \n\nIm interested in seeing your guys' responses and who knows maybe some anecdotal stats can shed a light on the attitudes behind drug use across different places.", "author": "theinkspirit", "score": 17, "flair": "I :love: Drugs", "created": 1594686540.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hqigu6/what_are_the_drug_demographics_of_your_area/", "num_comments": 93, "title": "What are the drug demographics of your area?", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fxxybr0": {"score": 13, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/hqigu6/what_are_the_drug_demographics_of_your_area/fxxybr0/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1594686611.0, "body": "Up here in upstate NY, its pretty much all weed", "replies": {"fxyh1z5": {"score": 4, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/hqigu6/what_are_the_drug_demographics_of_your_area/fxyh1z5/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1594695532.0, "body": "As an upstate New Yorker I second this, although in certain areas theres niches of other drugs.

The book \u201cDreamland\u201d describes how the opiate crisis got such a foothold here for that same reason. Most drugs that come up through Mexico or from the west to the east passes through Ohio, and people are kidnapped and trafficked up to the east coast while drugs circulate through the cities along the major interstates. If it doesn\u2019t go down through Canada or over on a boat/plane to New York it is guaranteed to come through Ohio. In Ohio, one can score marijuana, cocaine, heroin, meth, ecstasy, mushrooms, LSD, Xanax, adderall, any other pill you want with little to no problem, and as I said PCP, DMT, ketamine, various designer drugs and research chemicals like DCK and 2cb circulate around here occasionally from time to time but are fairly rare, and I have even heard of underground ayahuasca clinics in Cleveland. There are little towns and hippie communities (Athens, Yellow Springs, Hocking) that have communes and rampant psychedelic use as well. Personally, I believe Ohio has such a problem with drug use because first off, there is such a variety and constant availability, and unfortunately there are a lot of really hopeless people here who just don\u2019t know anything else, don\u2019t have good lives, and don\u2019t see themselves being able to leave or make something of themselves in Ohio.", "replies": {}}}}}}, "fxzof5p": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/hqigu6/what_are_the_drug_demographics_of_your_area/fxzof5p/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1594717811.0, "body": "Russia, the land of 4mmc abuse by dumb ass teens, where weed costs almost 30$ a gram.

Post history should fill in any gaps\n   \nThis guide will provide you with the required tools to not only get high on hard drugs often, but to build yourself a massive stash in your bathroom closet, keep said stash on your person, drive while intoxicated with drugs in your purse, and ultimately get away Scott free when all is said and done. Eventually, this guide will leave you in a position where your connects will dry up and people will start asking questions. Don't worry, I will give you the tools to make sure you get away high and dry.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn order to get away with this, you need to follow these steps::\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n1. Own a pocketbook(s) - this is probably the most important thing. You want something Coach ideally, and you can't just have one. You need at least 3, and that's on the low end. Ideally, you want so many that you are rarely seen with the same one. Often these purses have \"secret\" compartments, this will come in handy later. You want someone to see that purse sitting on a chair and think \"she's probably got a mortgage, I'm sure she's doing something important right now\".\u00a0it does not matter that you are unemployed and have been for nearly a decade, just make sure to keep that to yourself.          \n       \n    \n2. Posses child(s) - these offer the best protection, cover, and more importantly, access to drugs. I'd recommend getting at least 2 of them, but the more the better. You want to get yourself a kid who can be diagnosed with ADHD if you are into uppers, but if you're going for downers you really need to step your game up and start the MUCH more arduous process of getting your teenage child(s) diagnosed with a chronic pain disorder and more importantly, getting prescriptions for opioids, benzos, muscle relaxers, and gaba. It's best to start the process of warping their reality, gaslighting them, abusing them verbally, and cracking down their self esteem and sense of self worth as early as possible so you can make sure you get drugs out of them at the right age. There is a short window where they are old enough to be prescribed hard drugs while also being young enough to not see what's happening. They eventually will start to notice they are being used, but if you follow this guide hopefully by that point you will have a stash big enough to last year's. Each child, depending on the quality of the child of course, is worth roughly 8 prescriptions, so plan accordingly when you're Poppin out babies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n   \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n3. Be white - this may seem trivial, but of course this guide will only work for the White American. Notice I didn't say \"rich white\", and this is because socioeconomic status doesn't really matter. If you get busted, you're not going anywhere with that skin color. Rest easy cracker. Carry your pills in a bottle with your name, and hope to God that nobody ever opens it to find pills which you weren't prescribed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    \n    \n4. Constantly reference a decades old injury to justify your use of pills - this one may seem a little abstract, but when it comes down to it, this will be your Ace in the hole. When someone starts to question your addiction and clear and present harm to those around you, simply bring up your debilitating injury that you endured in the 80s.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0      \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    \n    \n5. Drink red wine and talk down to those who drink \"hard liquor\" - again, this is very important to maintain the appearance of a functional, high class drug consumer. Red wine can be drank while taking opioids, benzos, muscle relaxers, and gaba, but as you'll discover, this does NOT extend to other alcoholic beverages.\u00a0\u00a0     \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   \n    \n6. Own businesses, brag often of your success - You need a rags to riches story which can't be denied due to the way you've constructed your life. This brings me to my next point...   \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0      \n    \n7. Coach - this is very important. Tell your child exactly what to tell the doctor to get prescribed the highest dose of opioid painkillers, and assorted drugs of abuse. Teach them how to be a \"good pain patient\". Typically, these young children will not respond to these pills well, with vomiting, nausea, constipation, and intoxication. Convince them that \"if you don't take the pills, nobody will take your pain seriously.\" Start a lifetime of addiction early, lie often, and maintain a feeling of hopelessness/worthlessness to ensure they stay a pawn in your game.      \n    \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    \n8. Stack pills - convince your dope hook (child) to give you any and all extra pills. This includes: script changes leading to extra pills, pharmacy blips of extra pills which you will deny being given, and most importantly, when they start to notice the side effects are killing them from taking the legal max dose of 3 pills a day (totalling 90mg/day of morphine equivalent doses), tell them these words: \"if you tell the doctor you went down, he'll never let you go back up. Go down to 2 a day, and give the extra 1 a day to me\". This should go on for a few months, ideally 4, landing you with quite the stash. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n    \n9. Crush dissent - invariably, one of your offspring will eventually get wise to your use of them for pills. This is when that narcissistic abuse comes in handy. Claim their mental illness is bullshit, discredit their psychiatrists and therapists, and make sure everyone knows that your son isn't actually disabled or mentally ill. The second they start to catch wise to your plot **cut them off, kick them out, discredit them, and convince others to join in as you slander them, manipulate them, and cut ties cleanly while getting away with your stash of pills**. Bonus points if you manage to use the same things you built up as ways to attack their character. For example, if you convince them to take various pills, label them a lazy degenerate drug addict and kick their crippled ass out on the street. At times, your husband may as well. The same tactics apply.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n      \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n10. Continue this process until it comes to it's logical conclusion, and your son gets cut off at the pain center - this is the most important part. If you don't have complete control over their psyche, they may do something like flush all the pills. This is the only thing that can possibly go wrong. When this starts to become problematic, make sure you come at them while they are most vulnerable. Approach them while they are withdrawing from pills you convinced them to take, threaten violence, gaslight, and verbally abuse them so they are too afraid to take action. Now is when you want to start cutting ties. Start telling everyone that your son has a drug problem, all while slyly sliding your stash of pills away from them. Start convincing others that he is lazy. Say he was never disabled, claim they are not in pain, and try to invalidate any and all symptoms and diagnoses which you've spent the last 8 years cultivating and crafting. Pro-tip: claiming suicidal ideation is a very effective way of getting the pills \"out of their suicidal reach\". This is only going to be effective if you have invalidated their mental illness for the last 8 years, and convinced them that they were just lazy and not depressed. This is when other children will help you cut them out of your life cleanly. Violence is an incredibly effective tool in this fight. Proxy wars are the way to go. Get your eldest son to assault him, make it clear there are consequences for claiming their mother has flaws, or god forbid is using their son for pills.\u00a0\u00a0.  \n        \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.          \nAt this point, you should have a nice big stash of fentanyl, Morphine, Oxy, hydro, Flexeril, gabapentin, Xanax, and Valium, all in your son's name. These are YOUR drugs. Make sure it is known that you need to \"hold on to them\", to keep your son from acting on his \"suicidal impulses\" \u00a0    \u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    \n        \nNow, ramp up the threats of violence, embolden your other son's with their violent tendencies, and claim that violence towards your son is justified as long as he calls you a pillhead before they strangle you. This term is interchangeable with junkie, drug addict, alcoholic, and any terms which may properly identify your narcissistic abusive tendencies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.  \n   \nIf you followed these steps correctly, they should be out on the street while you're getting high in your foreclosed house, unemployed and one child fewer.\u00a0\u00a0.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.   \n   \nThis guide has been brought to you by my pillhead cunt of a mom-ster \ud83d\ude43.\u00a0", "author": "PillMomThrow", "score": 400, "flair": "Opioids", "created": 1572727098.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/dqjkw4/how_to_get_away_with_drug_crimes_in_america/", "num_comments": 63, "title": "How to get away with drug crimes in America.", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"f654viw": {"score": 202, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/dqjkw4/how_to_get_away_with_drug_crimes_in_america/f654viw/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1572727834.0, "body": "What the fuck", "replies": {"f66sjny": {"score": 72, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/dqjkw4/how_to_get_away_with_drug_crimes_in_america/f66sjny/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1572742405.0, "body": "My post history is jam packed if anyone wants the nitty gritty, as well as recordings of the crazy.

At higher doses it can feel almost intensely emotional but in a good way.  Also a very productive/creative mixture at low doses\n-F-phenmetrazine, opioid/benzo, cannabis (low dose): I like phenmetrazine analogues in general and they go well with cannabis and a little bit of something to quell anxiety.  It keeps you awake during higher doses to experience cannabis' mental craziness.\n-Dxm, Ativan, cannabis: incredibly euphoric\n-Nicotine, amphetamine or Ritalin: Love a ciggy while on stims\n-Kratom, Cannabis: Pure mental calm with a hint of psychedelia.\n-Ketamine/nitrous, cannabis: usually a mind blowing experience that can transport you to another dimension.  This combo is almost like it's own class of drugs.  Absolutely love it.  \n-oxycodone, ritalin: basically a speedball but better considering I prefer Ritalin over coke.\n-Lsd, cannabis, (low doses), nicotine (low doses): a little goes a really long way.  Taking LSD with Cannabis potentiates both drugs but the clarity of the experience seems to go down quick.  But taking nicotine seems to bring back the psychedelic sensory clarity.  Be careful not to take too much as it seems to get unpleasant quick and it seems a lot easier to of on nic.\n-Gabapentin on stim comedown: gabapentin was the best drug I found for stim comedowns of any kind.  Killed them at literally just 300mg which is nowhere near a recreational or impairing dose.  Awesome stuff.\n\nLeast faves:\n-Kratom, nic: unreal nausea and sweats regardless of nic tolerance followed by strong euphoria, but it's not worth it at all...\n-Dxm, Cannabis, Kratom: too much serotonin.  Not pleasant and even potentially dangerous.  Got my heart pumping at 150-180bpm for way too long at a low dxm dose of 120mg, half a j, and 4g of kratom but with very high tolerance.  Kratom affects DXM metabolism in a negative way causing reduced dissociation and increased snri effects.\n-DXM, Ritalin/coke: way too much stimulation\n-psychedelics, alcohol: even at low doses of LSD, it feels harsh on your body and kinda ruins the quality of the trip.  It's just not fun.\n-gabapentin, edibles: overly mentally stimulating and disorienting to the point of nausea.

Once your mind is (mostly) clear you can focus on your breath and do slow breathing, inhaling through your nose and breathing out your mouth. The most important thing is to try and have a very consistent *rate* inhale for a few seconds, expanding your torso, hold a couple seconds, and breathe out slowly over 5-10sec.  \nNext level : try and \"feel\" each of your body part as you do your expirations, tense and release muscles in your legs, arms, torso, back, neck and head.

Yesterday at 5:30pm I walked into walmart to buy myself a bottle of Delsym. A cough medicine containing DXM as the only active ingredient. I was fairly excited to try DXM, which I had been wanting to expirement with for a few months and had been researching hella during that time. \n\nI wanted to have a lower second plateua or high first plateau experience, and considering I\u2019m a big guy, I settled on ~300 mg for my starter dose. This would be my first experience with a dissociative, and I was looking forward to seeing what they had to offer, as I have experience with acid, weed, hydros, and xans but nothing in the dissociative realm. \n\nNow I\u2019m fairly careful with my drug use. I always test my acid with an Ehrlich reagent kit and I always research drugs a good bit before ingesting them, and this time was no different. Before this I had watched many DXM videos on youtube, read many paragraphs on Erowid, and talked around with friends about it. I was confident that I wasn\u2019t going to mess up. I had my long-time friend to tripsit me. I had jolly ranchers, sprite, and two styrofoam cups for the perfect fake lean. And I had my buddy\u2019s dorm to trip in while his roommate was out for the night.\n\nI got to the medicine aisle and there\u2019s an employee sitting at the blood pressure test station thing (the thing that squeezes ur arm), right next to the Delsym. I grabbed a bottle and flipped it over to read the back and double check that it had only DXM. \n\nYup. Dextromethorphan Polistirex. 30mg/5ml.\n\nAs I was reading the packaging the employee turned and looked at me. I was a little shook, not rly paranoid but flustered for some reason. And she asked me if I was waiting to use the blood pressure test, to which I responded \u201cno, you\u2019re good,\u201d and started to walk over to another aisle for some other things I wanted to buy. I did the quick maths to figure out that if a bottle had 150ml (148/149 exactly, cant remember), and 30mg dxm per 5ml, I would need 2 bottles to reach 300 mg DXM. 150ml / 5 x 30 = 150ml. Right. And I even pulled out my phone and used the calculator to double check. This is where I fucked up. Somehow. Someway.\n\nSo after checking out I decided I would go to a walgreens nearby to get my other bottle, as not to look sus buying two fat bottles of cough syrup at checkout. I cop the other bottle easy peasy and its the same size and content as the other. Forgot to mention they were grape cuz i gotta have that fake lean bruh.\n\nAround 7:30 me and broski are chillin in his dorm and I\u2019m pourin my shit up. I let the jolly ranchers dissolve a little in the sprite beforehand and everything. I poured the first bottle into the mix and gave it a stir. The shit didn\u2019t taste bad, not at all. I was proud. I downed it pretty slow probably in like 5 minutes.\n\nAlright. Time for the next one. Although I was feeling fairly nauseous and shtummy kinda hurt so I gave it a minute. Poured it up. Down she goes. Eh, more like half, then someone knocks on the door. Its friend #2 and friend #1 (tripsitter)  ends up goin down the hallway to hang in another friend\u2019s dorm for a minute so i get back to the double cup and take a few more sips, but I started to get real nauseous smelling the shit so i just dumped about the 1/5 that was left down the drain.\n\nSo I\u2019m waiting on the comeup just chillin and my bud comes back and we get to playin Bo3 zombies. Do that for like 40 minutes. Didn\u2019t feel much at this point but my stummy was makin a few noises. After zombies we went down the hall to chill with friend #2 and we kill some time there. Now at this point my stomachs starting to really churn and I know I gotta take a shit and I know its gonna be bad. So i go back to my dorm which is real close and get my wet wipes so I can deal with this easily. \n\nWhile I\u2019m sitting on the toilet I take notice that I\u2019m feeling sort of drunk. I know low dose DXM feels like being drunk so I knew I was comin up, however I didn\u2019t expect to go too much further. I had no clue. Walk back to broski\u2019s dorm and its chillin pt 2. Played Beat Saber on his VR headset. Was fye. I\u2019m started to feel it fr now. I got that \u201cdissociated\u201d feeling where it seems that im piloting my own body but I am somehow removed from it. And I was likin this shit. \n\nNext thing I know I look down at my phone and its only 9:30. I confirm this with my friend and he goes \u201cyeah, its only been two hours.\u201d My mind was blown, I thought it was 11:30 or at least 11:00. This is when it hit me. \n\nIm on the couch just taking in the experience and my friend asks if i want to throw in on his weed buy, to which I say \u201csure,\u201d and ask for 4 g\u2019s, (i used to smoke way more before college dont @ me). But I\u2019m way too fucked to go to my dorm and get my money so I ask bro to do it for me, and he does.\n\nWhile I was alone i really took note of the feeling. My whole body felt numb, kinda like acid except for the euphoria. I lost the ability to determine where my body parts were in relation to each other. My torso felt like it was a foot left of where it should be and when i moved my arms it was as if i was watching them on a television screen. When I stood I felt super tall and balancing was difficult. And I started to understand why they call it robotripping because i had to focus on the movement of my legs to walk and I felt like I was waddling kinda.\n\nSo I\u2019m waiting for friend to return and I\u2019m tryna text a coworker of mine to see if we can slide up to hers later and chill, and the door opens. I hear my bro, \u201cwhat\u2019s up?\u201d I respond, \u201cI\u2019m coolin.\u201d And I am. I finish my text. I start to describe how it felt to be alone while i was this off the shits and I turn around and take a good look and its not my friend, its his roommate. \n\nI\u2019m blown away. I\u2019m like, \u201coh shit my bad, I thought u were friend #1\u201d except i was stumbling over my words like a baffoon as if english was a foreign concept to me. I basically explained that I was off drugs and friend #1 was sitting me. And he was like \u201caight,\u201d we talked a little and then he dipped; he was coolin ab it. But I knew I looked and sounded like a fucking crackhead while talking to him, I was holding my eyes open wide af as every part of my body was experiencing some bizarre stimuli that I could not even fathom. I told him that me thinking he was my other friend was the wierdest thing that had ever happened. I was off the shits lmao\n\nAlright I\u2019m too tired to finish rn but I\u2019ll post the rest tomorrow. Hope yall enjoyed.

At age 12 I found a bottle of vicodin in my parents cabinet. I was hooked from right then and there. By 13, at the end of my freshman year of high school, I was a full blown addict with opiates. By 14, I discovered adderall and tramadol. This was my sophomore year. Every day before school started I'd take roughly 12-15 10mg hydros, two 20mg addys when I got to school and roughly 400mg of tramadol before 2nd period. Halfway through, I graduated to fentanyl and oxycontin in place of my hydrocodone/vicodin. No less than 160mg of oxys or roxis, and if I could find fentanyl I'd usually get the sucker things or just suck the gel out of the patches. This continued, every day, throughout my entire time in high school, an addict to multiple substances. \n     By 15 I shot up heroin for the first time, it was lovely, but for whatever reason I never got into it heavily. By the time I was 18, I've done everything there was to do. But for many years, opiates were my true love. By 22, I was using no less than 200mg of oxy/roxi per day, with the occasional 80mg of adderall here and there to feel extra sweet. By 24, I discovered my love for benzos. Mind you, I was still using opiates heavily and by this time I was also using heavy doses of Xanax and K-pins. When I say heavy, I mean 8-10 bars in one handful. Somehow, I was lucky to never have OD'd all but one time but I was wittingly courting death as I was convinced nothing could kill me. January of this year I decided to try a suboxone program for my opiate use, 24mg a day and it worked alright for me. But I couldn't stop the zans, and picked up a meth binging habit. \n     Fast forward to the end of April, I beat up my step dad for no reason during a black out. I went to jail, blacked out, bailed myself out, blacked out, walked home, still blacked out, fought my step dad again, ate the remaining 9 bars I had (according to my mom) and tried fighting the police when they came to take me back to jail. Fast forward to now. I'm 26, just celebrated my first birthday sober since I was 11yrs old. I'm facing 9 months in prison, thankfully because of covid I was only locked up for just shy of a month. I nearly died in jail from the benzo withdrawal. It was horrible. When I got bailed out at the end of May, it took no less than an hour for me to accept that it's time to change. I signed myself in to a PHP program which lasted until the middle of June, graduated and am now doing IOP. Which I'm on track to graduate from next week, on the mark of two months sober for me. The longest stint of sobriety in my whole life.\n     I don't know why I decided to write this, and for the sake of time I've skipped some incredible details. But maybe it can inspire someone. Nothing about this is easy, but if you find a reason to live it makes it worth it. For me, that reason is my little sister and my girlfriend who I absolutely adore. She's a fucking Saint, and I'm blessed that she's been there for me during the last 4 months, the hardest 4 months, of my life. This community is great.

Anyways the reason I\u2019m typing up this right now is I feel like drugs/alcohol have taken over my life. Here\u2019s a little information about me before I go into detail about my current situation;  I\u2019ve been suffering from narcissistic abuse from my parents most of my life, and it has gotten much worse as of recently. My addictive personality stems from the severe anxiety and depression linked to the abuse. My mother continually calls me disgusting, ugly, mentally ill, psychotic, selfish, a whore, etc. She\u2019s threatened me with suicide, threatened to kill me, but has never actually harmed me. I\u2019ve been forced to put on bronzer, wear certain clothes, etc. I was honestly convinced I was a monster.\n\nAnyways, I first started smoking and drinking when I was 14, I felt like I was finally able to escape from myself and be free. Unfortunately, it was only fun and games for a short period of time. I ended up getting expelled from school for arriving there wasted. \nThis was the breaking point for me; I decided that my life was no longer of value. I overdosed on 100+ pills (Xanax, Prozac, Paxil, and some other random shit). I was in a coma for 5 days then got sent away after that. \n\nI arrived home around 2 years ago and things have seldom changed besides the fact that I\u2019m not suicidal and I know how to keep my shit together on the outside. Sometimes. I decided about 6 months ago it would be a fun idea to drop some tabs. I actually had a great experience the first time, second time, third time and fourth time. The third time kind of messed with my head though, because I dropped some gel tabs (around 700 mics) and developed HPPD. (Yuh) (aye). However, I\u2019ve never felt so beautiful and been so content with life. I had a no hands orgasm that\u2019s how fucking good it felt. Anyways I got off track sorry. After dropping acid a few times, I discovered the \u201cwonderful world\u201d of opiates and benzos. My first time doing Oxys was over the summer, same with hydros and morphine, which then led to me doing Vicodin, Ativan and more Xanax. These drugs had taken a weight off my shoulders, I finally felt like I could relax. My body was no longer burning due to tension, my heart was no longer racing, my thoughts were no longer going 1000mph, it was a whole new feeling for me. \n\nThe problem now, is I\u2019m trying to stay sober. A few months ago I got my hand on some Oxys. I had around 110mg in my possession and I was hoping they\u2019d last me about a week. I took a few one night, then decided I wanted to get more high. Next thing you know they\u2019re gone. I passed out and woke up throwing up blood, I wasn\u2019t really that concerned because I was breathing at least and I got to stay home from school. Flu season amirite? Anyways I decided from then on I would stay sober for the sake of my relationship with my boyfriend and my other relationships. I\u2019ll just say that I\u2019ve done a pretty bad job at that, but I haven\u2019t done any opiates or benzos since then (besides an offered bar) Just smoking and drinking. \n\nNow we get to my current situation; all I can think about it getting high. All I want to do is get high. I feel so lonely without something in my system, I feel so anxious I feel like I can\u2019t do it and that I\u2019m hanging by a thread. I wish I had never touched anything, and I blame that on myself, not the drugs. I\u2019m afraid since I\u2019m so reckless that I\u2019m going to end up dead in the near future. I want to have a future, I get straight A\u2019s (I really don\u2019t know fucking how) and I try and learn something by observing every day. After all, each day holds and interesting lesson. \n\nI made this post because I need advice, I need support to stay sober. I want to feel motivated to continue with my hobbies.

I think that everyone with an addictive personality, or someone that has developed an emotional dependency on a drug, goes through this for a certain amount of time after the last use of a drug. It is hard right now but the longer you are sober the easier it gets. Some say the thought goes away after a long time, but I have yet to experience that. I am fighting this fight just like you right now, and its a mind fuck that can leave you completely overwhelmed, but I think it's about finding something that truly makes you totally focus on it, like playing an instrument (I play guitar), because that'll make you forget about the thought if only for a little bit. You have to be completely in love with what you are doing though in my opinion. I don't think I was ever truly passionate about something before picking up the guitar in all honesty, because it was the first thing that actually took my ADHD mind and made it focus all its energy on one singular task. It's like medicine for me, and I don't do it enough honestly. But anyway, I know that you can fight the urges and the thoughts because there are so many people out there who have been where we have been and they have pushed through and made it through. If they can do it, why can't we? Some believe in the idea that we are all one consciousness, so if one person can do something, it must mean we all can. I think there is beauty in that.

Little to no euphoria and just makes you feel sick and bloated especially after a lot of weak beers. Not an absolute waste of time though as the lowered inhibition and increased confidence can be a god send for anxiety in social situations. Non of these benefits even come close to outweighing the absolute shit storm that is a hangover  \n\nNICOTINE 2/10 - almost absolutely useless , the buzz can go from almost untraceable to unpleasant very quickly and is only ever worth doing in conjunction with other drugs , most notably weed \n\nWEED 6/10 - the staple drug of anyone\u2019s diet , everyone\u2019s tried it and everyone thinks they are an expert. Amazing for sitting at home binge watching movies , listening to music and eating. Only reason it\u2019s not higher is due to the absolute inability to think straight and have a normal conversation and after constant use it takes a lot to get that same rush that it used to \n( not a particularly dangerous drug , just be smart and stay hydrated ) \n\nCOCAINE 5/10 - completely overrated , barely lasts ten minutes and the high is underwhelming. Good if you have a LOT ( and are a millionaire) and is amazing at parties. Definitely worth a try but I wouldn\u2019t really consider doing it again . The comedown is about as bad as a hangover if not worse.  \n( coke can put a serious strain on your heart so it\u2019s best to not do other drugs or exercise while on coke ) \n\nNOS 8/10 - amazing euphoria and an overall good drug , not particularly good or bad ... that is until you start to mix it with other stuff and that\u2019s when shit gets crazy. It\u2019s like the secret DLC to any other drug and can change the experience drastically. I\u2019ll always remember the first time I did NOS and weed and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget it . That being said a shit ton of nitrous can give a psych effect unlike any shrooms or lsd i\u2019ve ever tried. \n( if done incorrectly nitrous can freeze your lungs or knock you out completely , make sure your not inhaling directly out of canisters and are taking in enough air with each dose as your body won\u2019t tell you if your suffocating yourself )\n\nKETAMINE 9/10 - I\u2019ve always loved a bit of ket , just something about building up from small lines and then feeling it all hit you all at once. Amazing for staying inside and just enjoying your own headspace and has the euphoria somewhat similar to nitrous, however it lasts a lot longer. I was very into ket at one point however a 1.5g to myself and a hefty K hole put me off that for a while . \n( good idea to try ket with a friend for a first time and stay in doors , it can seriously effect your judgment , can be very scary and could put you in dangerous situations ) \n\nMOLLY/MDMA 10/10 - molly\u2019s always been my favourite drug , it\u2019s a serious shame that I don\u2019t get to do it more often than every few months , the connection you feel to people ( and sometimes objects ) is just unreal. Doing this drug with the person you love or really just any close family or friends is an experience that no one can miss out on , it\u2019s the most wholesome time iv ever had.

I'm 21 years old. I hate drinking, but love drinking on xans. My parents started to drug test me and said I couldn't live at home if I'm going to use. Stopped cold turkey after a night of 10 bars. Exactly 5 days after that dose I had a seizure, fell and broke my back almost a year ago (May 2019). I still feel the pain in my vertebrae everyday. They started drug testing me everyday, they thought that this can cure my mind? Motivate me to stop? I only had to pass benzodiazepine tests. So I was doing anything I could get my hands on. Snorted H everynight for 2 weeks just to find some euphoria in my mind..didnt work. What a blessing! Made me violently vomit and gave me extreme headaches. \n\nFast forward to now, from May, I got my hands on a few bars when they stopped the drug tests. My dad can read me like a book. He knew I was using again. They started immediately verbally attacking me. It's still slightly a blur, but I was going to die in that bedroom. Getting dirty looks. Guilt. \n\nI tried dying. I had my cousin get me 90mg of legitimate prescription painkillers, which was a  mixture of hydros and oxys. I then threw 3 bars back. Laid down and blacked out. Didnt care about where I was going. I just wanted out. Woke up the next morning to the same routine of guilt and bullshit. I decided to beg my grandma to let me live with her. If she had declined, I don't know where I would be today. The addiction is so strong, a drug test can't fix me. I have to fix myself. I have to want change from within. \n\nI got off work early about a month ago, on a friday night. My parents were out to eat somewhere. I started loading up my stuff in my car. My mom started crying while sitting on the couch once they got home.

Should I have just changed and stayed? It took a clear head to understand that they pushed me away unintentionally. I'm always welcome to go back if I'm clean, but even being there for an hour to visit my dog, I get bored. Feel cramped. Stuck. Death lingering. \n\nI had to leave. I was going to die. \n\nI'm on good terms with my parents, I told them I didn't leave out of spite, I said that mostly to ease my own mind--not their's. Anyway, I'm still using. Have like 130 bars in my stash. \n\nMy entire point of writing this, is that you have to want change, it can't be someone else's will. Trying to take control of my own destiny day by day.

Downers are going to tend to be ranked higher because I just like to say fuck it and forget everything. \n\nWeed- 9.5/10. Substance you can use all the time, and nobody can really tell your high. This is when your tolernace is huge like mine. Only reason not a 10 is tolerance. \n\nOxycodone- 10/10. Most euphoric drug I\u2019ve tried, and the best opioid. Be careful, this can be hella addictive. 25mg catches me a nod. Amazing with weed \n\nHydrocodone- 7/10. Like oxy but I say 3 times weaker, and more sedating. Takes like 5 to even feel anything. Not really worth it but still a good drug . Addictive \n\nTramadol- 8/10. This one surprised me, it feels stronger than hydrocodone, and I\u2019m talking like 350mg tram imo would compare to 45mg hydro. Lasts all day and is energizing at the start then you might catch some nods toward the end. Mixes well with weed. Space the doses out, 50mg-100 every 20 minutes \n\nVyvanse- 4.5/10. Makes the day go by fast and the best stim I\u2019ve tried for productivity. Dry mouth is horrible and gives me nausea though. Comedown sucks \n\nFocalin- 6/10. Better than vyvanse, better euphoria but like no focus at all. Comedowns a little bit better \n\nXanax- 9/10. Best recreational benzo imo. Most sedating and best for anxiety I\u2019ve tried. Pop a xan then 25 minutes later go smoke a fat blunt and you are feeling good as fuck. Just doesn\u2019t last long \n\nK Pin- 8/10. Less sedating than Xanax, but around the same euphoria. Good with weed, and lasts a long time \n\nValium- 8/10. Good muscle relaxer and great for just chilling. Can\u2019t go wrong with diazepam. \n\nAtivan- 5/10. Never really got high off this just either put me to sleep if I took a high enough dose or completely wiped out anxiety. \n\nShrooms- 7.5/10. Tripped 3 times on these first time 2g and didn\u2019t really feel anything, next I took 3 grams and tripped pretty nice. Then a week later took 5 grams and didn\u2019t trip. The 3 gram trip was nice though and I wish to do more in the future as it might bump up the rankings. \n\nAcid- 8/10. I\u2019ve had really good times on this drug then really horrible. Set and setting. Euphoria is amazing. Please don\u2019t abuse this drug, major mental issues can happen \n\nDxm- 5/10. Really fucking weird. Made me trip harder than acid ever has, 500mg dxm will make you trip balls. Throwing up sucks though and that\u2019s what happens when you drink the syrup. Dirty high but a nice afterglow for the next couple of days. The only reason this isn\u2019t a 2 or 3 is because the afterglow. \n\nSynthetic weed- 3/10. Was on a bunch of Valium when I smoked this. I mean like a couple pinches of this stuff on some real gas in the gravity bong. Didn\u2019t really feel much but just really high. \n\nAlcohol- 6/10. Have had some fun ass times on this drug. Liquid confidence but tastes absolutely horrible. Rough on the stomach at times. Mixing with benzos can get really fun and crazy.\n\nCocaine- 5/10. Never really felt much. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever tried some good shit. Once I was with my friend and his co worker at subway doing lines but I was on xanax and I swear I couldn\u2019t feel the coke but my friend absolutely did. Wanna try again\n\nPhenibut- 6/10. Helped with anxiety, and made the day go by better. \n\nNicotine- 4/10. Makes me really nauseous and I feel it\u2019s a waste of money. But so is all drugs.

I have been trying to do acid for a while now, I have heard so many great things about it, the only problem was no matter how hard i tried I could never get it. So I was chilling in my room one night and I got a text from this goth girl who used to go to my school, we weren't really friends but we knew each other and smoked maybe once or twice together. She messaged me on snap saying her friend was selling 400 ug tabs and asked if I wanted to buy, I said yes and got super excited. I bought the tab the next day and my stepbrother agreed to be my tripsitter. We waited til our parents fell asleep and went down to the hangout room in the basement, I hung up a black light and put on a rap/hip hop playlist on youtube on the small tv that we had down there. I took the tab around 9:50 and swallowed it around 10:03, after an hour I noticed patterns and the ground began to slightly move similar to shrooms once they start to kick in. I was having a good trip and at around 3 in the morning we both snuck out to have a cigarette, for some reason I was fiending for nic and smoked 3 cigs in a row. When we went back in, my stepbrother said he was tired and wanted to fall asleep. I thought that since I was already having a good trip I wouldn't be able to have a bad one. After my stepbro fell asleep, I pulled out my dab pen and stupidly took like 7 to 8 hits.\n\nI was vibing to some chill music video by lil uzi and then I noticed the walls started melting and got a little scared because I could feel myself melting too and I didnt like it and got worried which then made me think about having a bad trip, and then it hit me that I was having a bad trip. I tried to wake up my stepbrother and I was telling him I was having a bad trip, but he was half asleep and just said \"dude chill out you'll be fine\". I was freaking out so I called my friend and asked to facetime, he said he couldn't but he said one of my other friends wanted to talk and see how the trip was going. I got on facetime with him and he basically became my tripsitter (he was really chill because he was off the hydros) he helped me calm down and talked to me. One thing about the night that I remember were the walls, the walls would constantly change from 4 stages, one stage was there were mouths on the wall biting at each other, another stage was  kaleidoscopes on the wall, another stage was just the walls completely turning to slime and melting ( everytime this stage appeared caused me to feel like I was melting so I would take deep breaths to help calm myself down and my friend on facetime helped me with it ), and the other stage which was the worst one was the bug stage, just letting y'all know I am TERRIFIED of bugs, even the most harmless like ants and butterflies, I've just been so creeped out by them ever since I was a kid. And on this stage, the wall would change to a bunch of flies/ flying beetles on the wall and they would swarm on me and start biting me, everytime this happened I did the same thing I did when the walls and I started melting, I would take deep breaths and then the walls would go to the next stage. And I remember the whole night, I felt like I was the vibe of the room and my goal was to not piss off the room. After my friend left Facetime to go to bed, I started having a bad trip again. So I go on my chromebook and started looking up how to stop bad trips, but I couldn't even focus on what the sites where saying cause all the letters were moving and shifting. I ended up just putting on some happy or uplifting show on the TV which helped calm me down.\n\nAfter that night, I had afterglow the whole day next day and it was terrible. The only thing that I'm confused about is what caused me to have a bad trip, whether it's the fact that I got high as shit while on 400 ug of acid, the fact that my tripsitter fell asleep, or the fact that I started thinking about having a bad trip. Anyway, lesson of the story is do NOT take 400 ug for your first time, it was scary as hell. The best way I can describe how a bad trip feels is like a bad dream that you cant get out of .", "author": "Pbrahl", "score": 8, "flair": "Psychedelics", "created": 1592622232.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hc6n23/i_had_a_bad_trip_my_first_time_taking_acid/", "num_comments": 22, "title": "I had a bad trip my first time taking acid", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fvd7nxe": {"score": 13, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/hc6n23/i_had_a_bad_trip_my_first_time_taking_acid/fvd7nxe/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1592622766.0, "body": "Definitely the weed lmao", "replies": {"fvd9fza": {"score": -5, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/hc6n23/i_had_a_bad_trip_my_first_time_taking_acid/fvd9fza/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1592623647.0, "body": "Nah mayne weed just makes the trips stronger he just wasn't ready for it to get stronger", "replies": {"fvd9x3g": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/hc6n23/i_had_a_bad_trip_my_first_time_taking_acid/fvd9x3g/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1592623883.0, "body": "I agreed that the weed was the problem?", "replies": {"fvde6nv": {"score": -1, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/hc6n23/i_had_a_bad_trip_my_first_time_taking_acid/fvde6nv/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1592625963.0, "body": "And I wasn't agreeing with you I was saying he just wasn't prepared", "replies": {"fvdobrk": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/hc6n23/i_had_a_bad_trip_my_first_time_taking_acid/fvdobrk/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1592631271.0, "body": "You are agreeing with him lol.

Also doing it at 15 isnt the best idea either like if it was lsd and not anything else being sold as lsd then it wont hurt your brain at 15 BUT since you're brain isnt fully developed  itd just make it a little harder to grasp the trip cause your brain might not be 'ready'. also the melting was ego death and when you start feeling out of control just accept it and ride the wave dont try to fight the ocean you'll tire yourself out and the ocean will still win. Fighting it versus accepting it is the difference  between laying on your back and floating versus flailing your arms around saying 'get me the fuvk outta this infinity pool' if you fight the trip the trip will fight back. One time on an extremely  high dose (I was on 8 gel tabs and my friend was on 4 gel tabs) he popped his neck wrong and pulled a nerve then temporarily  lost feeling in his left arm for a few days it was fine cause it was JUST a pinched nerve BUT at the time he had fully convinced me I was going to die and since I took twice as much as him I was gonna die twice as much or twice as fast and I ran home and played in one of our sheds and just played there like 'ok imma die now I'm ok with this I was gonna die eventually might as well be tripping' once I accepted it and let go the trip got WAYYYY BETTER even tho I thought I was going to die.

The noob got one tab the experienced one got 4 like the rest of us at first the noob does the usual 'I dont feel anything I'm immune to acid' BULLSHIT and then it fuckin hit em and it seemed to hit them harder than the rest if us. The worst part was the noob was a complete sociopath and was seeing bloody bodies and stuff and hanging corpses the rest of us couldn't see it but just hearing that he saw it was scaring us and making us a little scared of him like what if this guy forgets tripping and tries to kill us which almost happened lol. He was 100% enjoying his time too. At this point the first group had just hit the peak and started slowly coming down as the second group was hitting the peak. The noob it quite  literally  rolling around on the ground laughing mood swings sad angry anxious all the emotions  basically and he kept going places in his mind and thinking hed actually  left and came back. Oh and I cant forget to mention  that he kept doing the classic \"I think I'm sobor\" or \"I think it wore off\" just to realize he was still tripping. The noob was very loud and didnt get the memo to no be all like \"WOOOW HOLY SHIT IM TRIPPING BALLS THESE DRUGS ARE AMAZING\" oh and the most reckless with least care for his own safety (from the first group) did his usual move on the come down of pretending his mom wanted him to drive home RIGHT THIS INSTANT and he drives home like a flippin idiot (PSA NEVER DRIVE ON ACID) later I found out he just left cause the noob was scaring him annnnd he wanted to drive lol. Anyway so theres four of us left and with the noob not following tripping etiquette of dont be a dumbass hed woken up my neighbor in the middle of the night and my neighbor  came down to the tent (it's really easy to sneak up on someone whose tripping) he YELLED WHAT IN THE HELLS GOING ON DOWN HERE AND FIRED OFF A FUCKING SHOT GUN he did this like ten fucking feet away from us and we fucking bolted up the hill to my back porch and inside where we were met by all the adults (we were all over 18 but still at 21 I wouldn't consider my self an adult) they all knew what we were up to and were like WTF WAS THAT WAS THAT SHOOTING my mom hugged me and made sure everyone was ok my dad then actually  went to the neighbors house calmly with a stick and said I dont give a fuck what you're reasoning is if you shoot at my boys again we will have a problem and that's all he had to say.

You overthink everything, especially when you're new to it.

Aggressive and paranoid. Pretty euphoric. Never doing it again. So bad I couldn\u2019t get addicted to it \n\nAlcohol: Have gone overboard multiple times but it always sorts itself out. Hangovers suck but are easy to avoid. Overall great drug, fun to do and moderate abuse potential. Socially accepted. Probably not good to drink a couple beers every night like I\u2019m now doing but in our society I definitely don\u2019t get looked down upon by most for it. \n\nBenzos/Xanax: has fucked me over bad a couple times, but I don\u2019t abuse them at all like I used to. Can use these every now and again for sleep, anxiety, or trip killers with minimal risk of addiction. Using for more than 2 days in a row will equal 4+ days of rebound anxiety and it only gets worse. \n\nCocaine: Should probably be avoided but have  used it twice after being full blown addicted to it. Terrible comedown. Not really the best high either but you love it at the same time. High risk potential\n\nDMT: If you\u2019re a psychonaut definitely try it\n\nDXM: only done it 3 times at low-moderate doses. You can do it again with minimal risk of addiction but admittedly it makes me feel like a loser doing otc drugs from Walgreens. Pretty cool drug over all though\n\nKetamine: Amazing drug. Insanely beneficial afterglow and experience. I would definitely do it again in the future. Have done it in every form including iv and im. Moderate low abuse potential\n\nLove: anxiety during the come up, incredible euphoria at the peak, insanely bad comedown lol\n\nLysergamides/LSD: Abused it for two years and it fucked me up so badly I\u2019ll never use it again. AMAZING drug. Little to no abuse potential now\n\nMolly: one of my favorites. Never had a problem with abuse though. Definitely DON\u2019T abuse it. Low to moderate abuse potential\n\nMushrooms: Did them 10 or so times. Liked acid way more. Still a great drug. Low to no abuse potential\n\nMusic: Amazing multi drug. Good for bed, working out, all sorts of situations. Can\u2019t live without it\n\nNicotine: My FIRST substance. Smoked half a pack a day, vaped since I was 14, chewed nic gum. Was very addicted to it for the better half of my life. Stay away from it. High abuse potential\n\nNitrous: Intense high. Expensive. I went way to overboard with these and spent thousands of dollars in a matter of months. Never do them again except for on psychedelics.... maybe....High abuse potential\n\nOpiates: incredible feeling, never struggled with it as much as I did with some others for some reason. Morphine makes me sick, but I love oxy, percs, kratom, and hydros. Moderate to high abuse potential. Can do again but be weary. NEVER go to heroin.\n\nPhenibut: screwed with my anxiety but it helped me progress in my career for awhile. I wouldn\u2019t touch it again. Moderate to high abuse potential\n\nWeed: really a godsend. Amazing drug. Can definitely be abused but abusing weed doesn\u2019t produce that bad of side effects. I still smoke but a tolerance break every now and again is always good.

And I was wondering what you guys might think of as the best/worst tasting Drugs.\n\nJust to clarify, I am always talking about the most common route of administration, e.g. Smoking for Weed while Edibles are something different, Pills for Prescription Opioids, snorted powder for cocaine etc.\n\nI went through my roughly 60+ List of Drugs I've done before and here are the best/worst ones I found :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest:\n\n\\-Weed: A good spliff just tastes great, nothing much to add\n\n\\-Nitrous: This stuff really just tastes sweet and pleasant, creamy almost, for a gas at least.\n\n\\-Norflurazepam: Pleasant minty fresh almost sweet taste, this is true for powder or pills, the taste is caused by the drug itself\n\n\\-Hydromorphone: all the hydro pills Ive had before were sweet, and had a faint taste of Cream, really pleasant if taken orally, not so much if snorted. (Btw I also love this stuff, certainly does add to the association of a pleasant taste)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso I really do like the taste of Cocaine, but I think thats just acquired taste, and I have not done coke in some time so idk. In germany the Ativan also is usually prescribed as sweet and even soft pillows of ativan, like real pillows. Soft and instantly dissolve on the tounge. I think this design was made so that people who get it pre operation are not scared of the pill, or maybe for kids idk, but it certainly adds to the experience when doing these recreationally. The Soft Sweet cushion just is the physical Form of the Calming Ativan Feeling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWorst:\n\n\\-DMT: Burnt Rubber ? Tastes Awful.\n\n\\-MDMA: Crystals or Pills, does not matter at all, bitter and awfully chemical\n\n\\-Kratom: not THE worst, but you have to take 3+g depending on strain so, eh.\n\n\\-Ephinidine: The fact that depending on salt form, this stuff is very caustic probably adds to the overall experience of wanting to die pre-kicking in, but the taste really does not make it any better, chemical, bitter, sour, sucks.", "author": "G1nnnn", "score": 1, "flair": null, "created": 1575509454.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/e62lod/whats_the_bestworst_tasting_drug_in_your_opinion/", "num_comments": 19, "title": "Whats the best/worst tasting drug in your Opinion ?", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"f9neaey": {"score": 7, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/e62lod/whats_the_bestworst_tasting_drug_in_your_opinion/f9neaey/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1575511539.0, "body": "Mdma is vile.

My best advice in the interest of harm reduction is to set very strict rules, for example like use only once a month, you should even keep a log of the times you use.  If you notice your usage getting more frequent than what you have set, back off.  You will quickly see if you start getting into those that it becomes extremely easy to rationalize increased use, usually until you are doing it daily and getting withdrawals.  Trust me once you get into the cycle of rationalizing increased use, nothing anyone says will convince you to stop until you decide yourself, likely from running out / withdrawal.  Problem is that is a hard decision to make when you have a bunch of free opiates at hand.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously best thing to do is leave it alone since they are not your pills and your grandpa / grandma know they exist, I am positive they will notice after a while as the bottles begin to shrink.  Even after getting heavily addicted myself and coming off, if I found a stash like that again it would be nearly impossible to not dive back in.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne last suggestion is to order some Kratom.  It will give similar effects to those pills, does not have the danger of overdosing, but still has addiction and withdrawal associated.  Basically you could use Kratom as a trial run, if you find yourself having trouble controlling your Kratom use, then don't go near the pills.", "replies": {"fldb6a3": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/fo5671/i_may_have_fucked_up/fldb6a3/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1585089645.0, "body": "Didnt mention but have picked up kratom a few times. \nIts quite nice and I did go through an oz over 5 days as it was nice to buzz a bit at school but All it takes is a drive to the gas station for me cus they dont ID and I havent had any trouble there and there is no compulsion.", "replies": {"fldho2w": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/fo5671/i_may_have_fucked_up/fldho2w/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1585093526.0, "body": "Yea if you like Kratom I guarantee you will enjoy the hydrocodone, definitely set usage rules and do not under any circumstances break those rules.

You will likely need a higher dose. But it's best to start small, and work your way up to a dose that makes you feel comfortable. If you take too much, you may get nauseous, vomit, get dizzy/lightheaded, or have spasms in your eye muscles. If this occurs, you can try sleeping it off.

It definitely does. White grapefruit juice is best at potentiating, but you can use red grapefruit juice in a pinch, just drink more of it. Here's an explanation if you're curious:\n\n**How it works:** Kratom has a number of alkaloids in it, the two primary ones being mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine. These alkaloids are what get you high. Grapefruit juice has a chemical in it, called bergamottin.\n\nYour liver uses enzymes (mostly CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, but other enzymes are also involved) to metabolize kratom alkaloids. Bergamottin inhibits these enzymes, and prevents them from doing their job correctly. Meaning it prevents these enzymes from metabolizing the kratom alkaloids effectively.\n\nBecause your liver is unable to effectively metabolize the kratom alkaloids, your blood plasma will contain higher amounts of kratom alkaloids, for a longer period of time. Therefore, the high will be stronger and last a longer duration.\n\n**Instructions:** Drinking a cup/pint/whatever of white grapefruit juice 15-30 minutes (depending on whether your stomach is empty/full, as well as your individual biochemistry) prior to taking the kratom, usually does the trick. The idea is to allow the grapefruit juice enough time to begin inhibiting your liver enzymes, before dosing the kratom.\n\n***Extremely Important:*** There is an important, life-or-death catch. If you are on any medications, find out if it's safe to drink grapefruit juice while on your medication. Grapefruit juice interacts with a *ton* of pharmaceuticals, and many of these interactions are incredibly dangerous, even deadly. So before you try this, if you take any medications, you *must* find out if it's safe for you to drink grapefruit juice. If you cant find information online, ask your doctor or pharmacist. I recommend asking your pharmacist; they specialize in this type of stuff, and they're usually easier/faster to get ahold of. \n\nHope this helps!

I don\u2019t really like being around my mom while drunk so I stayed in my room most of the time.\n\nAt around 11 pm everyone has left and it\u2019s me my sister and her friend chilling in my room. Me and my older sister have always had a close relationship and she was giving me the \u201cYou my brother for life\u201d drunk speech.I get a text from one of my friends to go hang out and smoke some blunts. My sister knows i smoke and she\u2019s not really supportive of it but she\u2019s more of the harm reductionist. \n\nI let my friend know i\u2019ll be on my way sneaking out soon, i told my sister she said ok and i snuck out. About 20 minutes into my skate there i get a call from my mom so i\u2019m like fuuck she caught me she must\u2019ve been awake, but little did i know what the fuck i was in for. I pick up the phone and she starts yelling at me saying my sister is missing half a bottle of hydrocodones from her surgery and I was being accused of stealing it. I have never done any pharmaceutical drugs like that nor am i planning on it but there\u2019s only so much I could do to defend myself.I was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. \n\nI tell my mom to drug test me and she said no because \u201cI\u2019m probably selling them\u201d then i tell her to drug test my hair because if negative, that means i\u2019ve never touched a hydro and the script bottle was still there and i thought i was good but my mom just said \u201cfucking lier\u201d and hung up. I was then chased by some crackhead because it\u2019s texas. Luckily i was on a longboard and got away.\n\nI get home. my parents are both drunk to a [10] and there is no reasoning, just yelling and fighting with my sister my stepdad and my mom all ganging up on me. \nI didn\u2019t really know what to do or say so i just let them chew me out because there\u2019s no reason with intoxicated people especially when it\u2019s alcohol. \n\nIn hindsight, my original intentions to sneak out and go smoke probably weren\u2019t the best, but that\u2019s incomparable to being seen as an opioid seller/addict. \n\nThis whole situation took a long time for me to process and I just don\u2019t know how shits gonna be. \nI know my mom has messed with vvyvanse and xans before so she is my main suspect but now it\u2019s too late to seek justice. My relationship with my sister is never going to be the same. My stepdad thinks i\u2019m the devil. The only person who believed me was my biological dad and he has been through shit growing up in a pretty rough part of houston. I\u2019m not selling pills i\u2019m not taking them i just don\u2019t understand why someone would try to frame me for this shit.

But its an extremely enjoyable dissociative and I've never had a negative time while on K.\n3. **Etizolam**: for me I find that Etizolam is much more enjoyable than Xanax/Valium. It doesn't turn me into a zombie, but takes off the edge of anxiety while having a slight euphoric effect. Always like to have this stuff on hand when doing any psychedelics. \n4. **Mushrooms**: just amazing, lol. When done in the right environment and the right mindset, shrooms can be very eye opening and beneficial. I prefer these over LSD.\n5. **Kratom**: I personally don't use Kratom in high doses, so I don't feel much of a high, but it does work in a stimulating way in lower doses. I like using this as an alternative to Adderall when I need to focus on getting something done.\n6. **Acid**: I think at this point I've tripped so many times with LSD that I'm bored by it. But I still enjoy the visuals and and the sense of connection you feel with the world. I also ranked it lower because I don't like how long the trip lasts.\n7. **Weed:** I used to be an everyday smoker and it would have very calming effects on me, but now it just gives me extreme paranoia and anxiety, even Indica strains. \n8. **Amphetamines**: I love the come up and peak of amphetamines, but the comedowns are almost unbearable for me. So much anxiety mixed with such an intense feeling of agitation. \n9. **Cocaine**: unlike most people, I actually dislike cocaine. It isn't enjoyable enough for me personally to spend money on it. Not to mention the high only lasts around 20 minutes and the comedown sucks.\n10. **Nitrous Oxide**: I loveeee the high of whippets but the ear ringing and the fact that it only lasts for about a minute is why I ranked it so far down.\n11. **Hydros:** didn't do anything for me except make me nauseous. \n12. **DXM:** I've only had one experience with DXM and it was horrendous.

Let me start this by saying I haven\u2019t used anything but weed for the past 4 months and I have not missed 1 day of school and I have all A\u2019s & B\u2019s.\n\nMeth: well over a few ounces, smoked 90% of it except when I first started I did lines. Used daily from about March 8th to June 3rd roughly. And when I say daily I mean I was puffin on that pipe every minute of every day... something about that pipe pulled me into a hole deep.\n\nCocaine: 4-5 ounces over December 15th 2018- sometime March 2019, I did not daily cocaine, it was more of a binge thing for me. Only snorted it. Would by a quarter ounce every once in a while and binge. \n\nLSD: dropped double dose gel tabs a few times, wasn\u2019t my thing.\n\nWeed: will never be able to explain the love I have for weed. It has helped me so much to get through school, It gives me powerful motivation by giving me something to reward myself with, like if I get all my shit done each day, I can kick back and smoke.\n\nOxys: got a couple full scripts of oxys about 8 months back, popped like 8 an then traded the rest for coke\n\nHydros: popped like 3 an traded the rest for coke.\n\nAdderall: fucked with it before meth & coke, would pop well over a 100mg before I did ANY research on it and probably didn\u2019t even know what a stimulant was, I just knew it felt good.\n\nXans: I\u2019ve popped like 10 2mg bars all together. Pharmas. There alright, I just don\u2019t like the fact that you literally time travel lol, like once second you pop it and then before you know it, it\u2019s 6 hours later and you don\u2019t remember anything.\n\nCrack: smoked probably just under .5 grams of crack all time lol. I was kickin it at my plugs house and I think he thought I would keep buying after, but he threw my like what I would presume around a .3-.4 rock, and I smoked it and I told myself never again. Because it\u2019s the stupidest shit I\u2019ve ever seen... it made me feel alright, but like I hated the effects but my mind just wanted.. well.. more crack haha. So I said fuck that.\n\nFentanyl: done probably just under 500 fent pressed 30\u2019s off foil over a faaaat period of time. None recently tho.\n\nVyvanse: used to have a script\n\nRitalin: currently have a script, and surprisingly... I take it as prescribed!!!!  Once a day. That I\u2019m proud of lol... usually if I have a drug sitting around like that I\u2019d pop quite a few to get some \u201cenhanced effects\u201d haha.\n\nPlease don\u2019t hate, I\u2019ve heard it enough. Just wanted to share. Don\u2019t need a lecture. I went through numerous charges and got expelled last year, and I have learned my lesson and am on track to actually graduate on time!! I\u2019ve always wondering if the fact that my dad was addicted to meth for 20 years before I was born, and my mom was addicted to meth for 4 years before I was born, and my grandpa (on my dads side) has been addicted since before I was born to this very day, could that have any effect on why I enjoy drugs so much? Do genes have any effect in that or am I stupid? Btw my mom is an amazing mom, she works her ass off to put us in a nice place to live and my dad lives a couple hours away but he cleaned up and has a great job aswell. They don\u2019t allow me to do ANY drugs I just wanna through that out there.

My first idea was to wake up early, maybe 6-7am and pop them on an empty stomach, should be done by the time my dad gets home but I have no idea how these are gonna effect me.\n\nThe other option is I wail till around 8pm tonight when my parents settle down for bed and I take them then, that way I can just fall sleep like normal if they hit hard or whatever. Only risk with that is if for some reason one of my parents were to try to talk to me within 2 hours after dosing, is it gonna be obvious that I took a couple hydros? My parents used to be drug addicts in the 80's so they know what to look for", "author": "nutgurb", "score": 4, "flair": "Harm Reduction", "created": 1576826866.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ed1eev/first_time_with_hydros_need_advice/", "num_comments": 12, "title": "First time with hydros need advice", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fbf19ip": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/ed1eev/first_time_with_hydros_need_advice/fbf19ip/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1576827771.0, "body": "Take both, u won't be \"fucked up\" but possibly more talkative/outgoing, and in overall better mood.

Some people think it potentates your buzz off the Narco, but in reality it doesn't. When you are high amounts of opiods you will start nodding in and out of consciousness, and since DPH makes you sleepy they think getting drowsy is improving the high, but it doesn't really help the euphoria, and just being drowsy ain't the same thing as nodding. \n\nSince you seem kind of new to opiods here is another antihistamine that is often paired with them to read about if you feel like. \n\nIt is called Promethazine. Depending on where you live availability may be different. Canada it is legal OTC. US it is prescription. Pretty sure I've seen it in various European Countries as legal OTC. I know you can get it in the UK at any pharmacy as long as the counter assistant signs off on it, and no actual prescription needed. Just say you have an upcoming flight, and get motion sickness in the air. Works every time. Anyway. Some people complain about stomach cramp like pains or the feeling of intense nausea (especially if they get too hot) from opiods when they first start using them.

I just want some insight or something like that.\n\nNow I like to lurk this sub and read others stories because I too am a fellow user. I've always been a big fan on benzos (not sure why, but they've always felt right to me). \n\nA couple days ago I get my hands on a 60mg pill of oxycontin and a pill of 10/325 hydrocodone and of course always have a handful of Xanax on standby. That being said I have a huge tolerance to Xanax, however my tolerance to any pain pill is zero to none.\n\nI've read horror stories of mixing benzos and opioids/opiates and of course my stupid self feels like if I'm going to die, that's the way I'd want to go. \n\nI start off chewing about 6mg of pressed bars (I've never had legit alprazolam) and start to feel them. Around 15 minutes in I take a couple more bars unchewed so I'm up to around 5 bars in my system (10mg if I'm counting correctly lol). \n\nNext off I went and got a few Smirnoff ices (my favorite) and drank a couple. \n\nHere's where the oxy and hydro come in. I pop both of them around 45 minutes with another bar of Xanax. After all this I'm doing my thing listening to music and playing some games and start to get tired. I never really noticed my breathing get shallow or something like that. \n\nI hope into bed and pass out basically fading in and out of consciousness. I'd look at my phone and I'd see Reddit, pass out, wake up and then it was on pornhub (lol). \n\nNow before I get comments, yes I know this is a stupid mix, I know the dangers of it and have done a ton of research. However when I woke up today (unexpectedly) I was...fine per say?\n\nHonestly I didn't really know what I wanted to happen, I've always had suicidal tendencies and maybe figured it was the way to go.
