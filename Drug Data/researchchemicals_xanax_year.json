{"gs4rnm": {"text": "There is always the same question being posted to r/researchchemicals asking, \u201cwhat rc benzo is best for treating anxiety long term\u201d. The true answer you\u2019re looking for, but don\u2019t want to hear, is none. None of them will ever work out for long term treatment, only short term. These substances WILL eventually be banned. But that\u2019s not the only problem you have in sight for you.\n\nYou rebuttal might be, \u201cOh well I can order 10 years worth of substance\u201d, or \u201cI can learn how to use the dark web after they\u2019re banned\u201d. Yeah that definitely doesn\u2019t account for when you have you\u2019re eventual, and trust me it will happen, black out and eat fucking 3 grams of substance, then black out for 3 more days and repeat that cycle. \n\nI\u2019m speaking from experience. Blacked out ate 1 gram of diclazepam. Then did that over and over again with a bunch of other rc benzos. Woke up in jail a week later with no clue what happened and went into severe withdrawals. Your lil benzo plan won\u2019t be there to save you when you\u2019re incarcerated now will it, it definitely didn\u2019t save me.  \n\nAll of sudden you\u2019ll have to go somewhere out of state or out of country. All of a sudden your house burns down. A home invasion occurs on your house. There are SO many possibilities. An emergency surgery where you\u2019re taken to the hospital without your benzo plan.\n\nTrust me your tolerance can and will get so high that you would need 500 mg of a substance. I got up to fucking 80 mg of Xanax a day and STILL needed more supplementation with kolonopin and any drug I could get my hands on just to keep my fucking sanity and hold back the withdrawals. There\u2019s no amount of planning that makes this smart. Expose yourself to what makes you anxious and your brain will make new connections. Learn the art of not giving a fuck, as I like to call it. \n\nI\u2019ve been sober 11 months from benzos and all benzo derivatives and I feel better than I have my whole life. \n\nA great alternative to benzos is colondine or propranolol. They\u2019re blood pressure medications that block your adrenaline so that you can\u2019t get anxious. They felt very similar to the effect of a benzo to me. Please please try at least that before going through with your, destined to fail, plan.\n\n\nIf you would like to hear all of the trials and tribulations you\u2019re signing up for by attempting this plan, please pm me and I will explain everything. I will not lecture you, only try to show you what I went through and why there ARE alternatives.", "author": "rickflair69420", "score": 365, "flair": null, "created": 1590695116.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/gs4rnm/for_all_that_think_you_can_treat_anxiety_long/", "num_comments": 187, "title": "For all that think you can treat anxiety long term with rc benzos", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fs30ia2": {"score": 151, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gs4rnm/for_all_that_think_you_can_treat_anxiety_long/fs30ia2/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1590698640.0, "body": "It's always the same: Go see your doctor.

I have used opioids pretty heavily for about a year and a half or so and I abused kratom similarly for a year and a half about six months after getting clean cold turkey from opioids.  I abused oxy, hydro, heroin (almost certainly with fentanyl) and loperamide w/ Omeprazole.

Mostly it was the disoriented and manic state of intense aggressive cravings along with a bunch of shooting nerve pain and spasms.  Also had cold chills and hot sweats.  \n\nKratom sent me to the hospital about three times over the course of two weeks in multiple 5 hour long terror filled panic attacks a day during and for a while after the acutes which were a psychological hell I simply can't compare to any other drug.

Tramadol is pretty nefarious shit.  I've heard a lot of people say it comes with no real good opioid effects but a withdrawal equally shitty and sometimes even worse.  There are actually quite a few cases of psychosis from people quitting tramadol, something not many other opioids can actually do with the exception of methadone and maybe some others.  Personally, if I were your mother, I would stick to kratom and just be wary of the dosage, not trying to go too crazy and maybe taking some time every once in a while to taper.  It's some I know a family member with two slipped discs did with hydrocodone successfully.  It's a good plant for certain cases that personally quelled physical pain from powerlifting a lot better than a lot of other opioids, especially nerve pain.  I think if you're using it for legitimate physical pain, it's honestly the best thing out there.  If you use it for things like anxiety and depression, I actually remember feeling pretty good when I only used it every few days, even on days I didn't use it.  I ultimately started using more frequently because of some stressors that popped up in my life.  What may be a good idea is to try to taper off of it and keep it as something you do every three to four days or during moments of severe anxiety in place of something like a benzo.  I would take kratom over Benzos any day.  Maybe if you're worried about dependence and you're living with someone willing to help you, you can have them dispense you doses every once in a while.

No more than 4 mg of xanax on the heaviest days and the lightest days clocked in at 1 mg.\n\nThe next 6 months I tapered slowly with my stockpile of 0.25 mg xanax. I had a few 1 mg days initially but dropped to 0.75 mg quickly once I started getting serious about nuking this cancerous mess I had gotten myself into.\n\nThe taper was easy. I had plenty of time to gradually get down to less than 0.25 mg per day and eventually 100% clean of all benzos.\n\nNow the party really fuckin' starts.\n\nThe next year and a half was literally hell on earth....every fucking day. Not once did I feel even the tiniest cunt hair of progress of any kind. Anxiety far beyond the roof, sweating bullets everywhere & anywhere (soaked shirts on the daily), hyper-sensitive hearing, absolutely ballistic muscle spasms, insomnia unlike anything I had ever fucked with, etc.\n\nAt the end of that first year and a half I felt my first 'click' of progress towards my old self. Anxiety dropped *slightly,* I sweated a bit less, spasms simmered down a smidge, etc. I was thankful to feel *any* progress but considering it took 1.5 fucking years clean to achieve anything made it feel so fucking minuscule...\n\nThe next year was *slightly* less of the same hell on earth. Every fucking day. Ever so slightly easier to deal with, but not much!\n\nOnce I hit the 2.5 year mark I finally felt like I had several clicks of progress forward and was finally becoming much more like my old self. I still had mild PAWS but they were actually fucking manageable and much easier to try to tune out in everyday life.\n\nAfter that it's been smooth sailing. Eventually anxiety lowered to 'normal' levels....call them \"pre-drug levels\" if you will. Drenched shirts were finally a thing of the past. Hearing went back to normal fucking levels. Muscle spasms still happened but they weren't happening daily anymore and they were a cake walk compared to what I was used to.\n\nI quit all benzos July 2009. I'll be 11 years clean this summer.\n\nThe best part? My muscles still fucking randomly spasm sometimes. Maybe a few times a year, always at random.

I never once combined it with alcohol. Now, I never exceeded 1mg/day of  Etizolam, using 0-0.5g most days, also without alcohol.\n\nI think it is good to be cautious, but there are a lot of people who look for an RC solution solely because they lack affordable and reasonable access to healthcare or are tired of having their prescriptions switched or cut off against their will. Some people have very few options to pick a doctor (geographically or insurance wise.)\n\nI have heart failure, and being able to differentiate between panic attacks and heart attacks (with instruments, with nitrates, with benzodiazepines, etc.) has reduced ER and hospitalizations (for chest pain and anxiety difficult to distinguish from additional MIs) from 20-40 days per year to 4 days total\u2014two years running with zero this year. Those days not in the hospital save me far more money that RCs cost. At my costs, 3 days of hospitalization costs more than an entire year of sealed pharma tabs at my dose.\n\nI think the key is to not chase the euphoria and not expect a complete elimination of symptoms, and to monitor your supply so you have the ability to taper before you run a risk of running out. Zero anxiety is not realistic, but reducing it to manageable levels can be enough to live a functional life for many people.\n\nThey provide some relief, but trying to get \u201cmore\u201d relief leads to unsustainable dosing. Used correctly it can reduce instances of anxiety and prevent mild-mid-level anxiety from spiraling upward.\n\nOnly an individual user can know for themselves if they are someone who cannot control their use pattern or whose past experiences with drugs or suggest a risk of misuse or inability to fund reasonable use.\n\nPersonally, I never sought to increase my dose and never even heard of RCs until my Rx was cut off. Others may find RCs cost less than pharmacy Rx chems if they can get them.\n\nIf you can\u2019t handle them, or handle having an endless supply of them... there is nothing wrong with admitting that and it is wise to respect those limits. \n\nI think it becomes a bit excessive to insist that *nobody* can use them in a responsible manner consistent with what an MD might prescribe, or that they will necessarily lead to misuse or inefficacy at reasonable doses. I would say it is also irresponsible to insist that some other treatment is automatically more effective, absolutely necessary to combine, or that the alternative will definitely lead to less harm.\n\nSome people do not respond well to other treatment avenues and poor response may lead to severe consequences or side effects. \n\nEspecially those with disabilities, transportation issues, or cash flow problems, even going to therapy (Reddit\u2019s favorite end-all-be-all solution to everything) can be prohibitively difficult, expensive, and ineffective.", "replies": {}}, "fs6ribp": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gs4rnm/for_all_that_think_you_can_treat_anxiety_long/fs6ribp/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1590777750.0, "body": "IIf you have that much anxiety you should see a doctor and if you do benzo, you should use the medical institution to help you not to abuse them", "replies": {}}, "ft412hs": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gs4rnm/for_all_that_think_you_can_treat_anxiety_long/ft412hs/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1591475217.0, "body": "As someone who abused benzos for 10 years both pharma and rc and then tried phenibut which helped but had alot of sides plus not a long term i can honestly say the only long term treatment for me is organic non gmo ashwagandha i already know some of you guys feel like yall tolerance to benzos is to high to reap ashwagandhas benefits but is not im coming from a 80 mg a day alp habit and a flualp habit that could of put me in a grave now i just take two 10g doses of ashwagandha 1 in the morning and 1 at night and im good", "replies": {}}, "fvlbumk": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gs4rnm/for_all_that_think_you_can_treat_anxiety_long/fvlbumk/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1592816691.0, "body": "The anxiety you are trying to postpone is nothing compared to the anxiety that will come from benzos.

That's abuse in the name of getting high. 80mg of Xanax would last me approx. 2 years.\n\nSome of us reserve the use of these compounds as an actual medicine, and only use them for \"in case of emergency, break the glass\" type situations, similar to how someone would use Advil; you wouldn't take Advil all day, everyday, and in increasing amounts, just to try and prevent a headache from occurring in the future.

I've struggled for like 14 years with benzo addiction (on and off.. then on.. then off. Then, you guessed it, on and then off. Over and over). The problem with benzos if you have an acute anxiety disorder is that they work. They work SO well. But, it doesn't erase the underlying issue. It's more like a band-aid. I never ended up in jail because of benzos. I always found other ways to get myself locked up. Most recently, I was using Clonazolam, Etizolam and Diclazepam interchangeabley for a couple months and once again I ended up in the hospital when I went CT (not my choice this time). The withdrawals were so bad this go around I actually had a psychotic episode and had two week long sleep deprivation fueled hallucination filled journey that involved me jumping out of a vehicle in the middle of a busy intersection and ended up walking for 30 miles talking to people that weren't there (see: shadow people) and seeing and feeling bugs on my skin and crawling out of my ass. Fun. \n\nI still don't know how I didn't get arrested. I freaked out a bunch of people at a gas station and they actually called the cops, but for whatever reason they let me go after asking me questions for a few minutes. After that I remember sitting down on the curb in some neighborhood and then some time later I woke up to EMTs telling me I passed out from heat exhaustion. They bought me Gatorade, beef jerky and gummi worms and then turned me loose. I asked them to give me a ride home but I was still like 8 miles from the house so I had to keep walking. They wouldn't take me (it's not their job after all. They're not a taxi service). I eventually found my way to a family member's house where I finally (finally!) Slept for 14 hours. Then again on and off for several days. This was allll fueled by benzo withdrawal. Not worth it people. Never been more terrified in my life. This wasn't even the first time I've been in acute withdrawal from benzos, but it was definitely the worst. Moral of the story is if you struggle with mental health issues, please go see a doctor.

I\u2019ve been clean from heroin/oxy for a while, and only taking Xanax or any benzo research chemical that I could get my hands on. \n\nI got 400 0.5mg Flubromazolam tablets and went to a McDonalds bathroom to pop them. In the past, I needed at least 20 of these tablets to feel high (my tolerance was absurd). However, I had very recently got out of rehab and had over 30 days clean, so this time I only popped 10 of the pills. \n\nI suppose it was too much. I don\u2019t remember if I took more after that, I just remember waking up in the ICU. They had a huge tube down my throat and a machine breathing for me, and I kept shitting the bed uncontrollably. I was absolutely fucked, I just couldn\u2019t believe it happened to me. I used to mix fentanyl and Xanax together all the time in high doses and never overdosed, but just 5mg of Flubromazolam was enough to make me collapse on the McDonald\u2019s floor and stop breathing. \n\nI used to think that severe respiratory depression only occurred when someone *mixed* benzos with opiates, as opposed to only taking the benzos. I was very wrong. This shit can kill you on its own, and it really doesn\u2019t take that much to do it.\n\nI was in the ICU for several days recovering from the overdose and they had me on suicide watch the whole time because they thought I was trying to kill myself taking all those pills. The cherry on top for all of this was the police finding an unmarked plastic bag with around 390 Flubromazolam tablets in my pocket. I was interviewed by the police briefly about the pills because they had no idea what they were, but luckily they didn\u2019t charge me with anything. I wondered if that was because Flubromazolam is technically legal, or because they saw that I was just a young addict and not a drug dealer.

I overdosed on etizolam and poppy seed tea back in July, so yes you definitely can overdose.

Myself being an opiate and benzo addict can attest to the risks of combining these two drugs, your playing with your life every time you take them. I just wish they didn't feel so damn good together! I guess my point is is that there could have been a possibility of the pills not being what you thought they were, or had something else in them along with the flub? Did they say anything to you about how they stabilized you? Like if they had to use narcan or something? I'm assuming the police refused to give you back your 490!

Plus, for me the real dissos mindfuck only happens during the come up when you do high doses.\n\nIn fact, I'd say the term \"mindfuck\" is more specific to psychedelics. With dissos it's more of a disorientating sensation: \"where am I, what am I, what's happening to me?\", ideas rushing at light speed around your brain without you having any control over them, or plain feeling yourself surrounded with entities and hearing voices and manically interacting with them until the disorientation starts to fade out and you realize there were no entities talking to you, it was just different parts of yourself engaging in some weird dialogue (note: only high doses there, works best with opce from my experience if that's what you're looking for).\n\nI've done plenty of psychs and plenty of dissos. The two just aren't comparable. The disso experience is mostly a mental journey and even if with high doses you can end up having some kind of \"visions\" during the disorienting phase, it's nothing to do with what you can see or feel with psychs.\n\nOf course being an experienced psychs user will give you a head start compared to someone who never did psychs. But only because you've had experience adjusting to a new very confusing state of mind with psychs. Both the experienced psych user and the other will be in completely unknown territory. And the strategies to deal with bad feelings on high dose psychs are completely different than those for dissos.\n\nAnyways, even if you're an experienced psychonaut in the psychedelic universe, don't take that experience for granted when approaching a new completely different substance. Some of that experience might make things easier for you to get comfortable in that other universe but it might also not.\n\nIf you're an experienced psychs user thinking about experimenting with dissos, great for you! Those drugs are awesome and very interesting to explore. But don't go there thinking that because of your psychs experience you can skip learning how to walk and everything will be well if you start shooting for high doses from the start. It might go well... it might not. Better for you not to take that chance.\n\nAnd to add a further note for an experienced psychs head: dissos have a way higher potential for addiction than psychs. So be very careful of your usage, at least until you learn how they work from your own experience. There's only so much that can be learned about a drug from other users. Your journey with them will be your own and most likely completely different from mine (even though I was a pretty experienced psychs user when I started experimenting with dissos... I guess psychs were getting boring for me and I wanted to try something different. I was not disappointed!)", "replies": {}}}}, "g4vhviy": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/iqlow8/always_check_drug_dosages_on_psychonaut_wiki/g4vhviy/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1599892971.0, "body": "Im not saying i would be able to handle a high dose im saying if i try it and dose a little to high ill probably be able to ride it out at least", "replies": {"g4vk4oz": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/iqlow8/always_check_drug_dosages_on_psychonaut_wiki/g4vk4oz/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1599894262.0, "body": "I personally think it\u2019s a lot harder to let go on psychedelics than dissos.

Most I've done in a binge must've been >350mg in about a week. It took more than a week to fully get back to earth. And I was starting a new job the week I was coming down, fun times!\n\nWorst experience was the first time I did a >100mg binge on 3-meo-pcp. I took roughly >200mg in a 24 hour binge. Got to sleep with benzos and woke up to my alarm clock telling me it was time to get to work. And I was still completely on the moon at that time. I said: \"what the fuck, I'll just tough it out\". Went to work, played it cool with colleagues (even played with fire: I was so high that I had locked my phone so I went see a colleague to ask him if he knew how to unlock it, we spent 30min in his office smalltalking while he was looking up on the internet what to do...). I was fucking amazed that in the state I was, I just had to play it as if everything was normal.\n\nBut then, it became hard... I knew I was going to come down at some point but I had no idea how. And while at work I could only do minimal stuff and otherwise pretend I was working. The worst of the worst was the sleep. I didn't have anymore benzos, so that was out of the question (and it would have made things so much easier). The first night I didn't sleep... still played it nice at work, was even able to fix a bug in an old app I had developed and deploy it on the client's server without a hitch, though, I would've kissed my past self for the well detailed deployment process in the document he had written months earlier. That night I tried using booze to get some sleep, had maybe 1.5 to 2h of sleep... day at job was a real pain in the ass, even though I *was* coming down, I was still high as a kite. Anxiety started to roll in, I was exhausted, the day felt it had lasted weeks.\n\nThat night while trying to sleep after drinking, I decided that I couldn't continue doing that. Maybe got 3h of sleep that night which felt like it lasted several years. On the morning I called in sick, went to see a doctor, who signed me an attestation so I didn't have to go back to work for the week and she also pointed me to the old addictology center where I had been during my opiates addiction times.\n\nWent there, got an appointment for the next day and a talk with one of the nurse. Nice guy, very warm and never judgmental, I already knew him from the time I used to go there before. I told him about my current situation, unfortunately, he's not a doctor so he couldn't give me anything to help me sleep so I had to turn to my old friend booze again that night. Maybe got 4h.\n\nThen I went to my appointment with the addictologist, I was still high as a kite even though I'd been coming down for 5 days at this point. She gave me some antipsychotics for the trouble sleeping and saying they might help for the other *symptoms.* I also got her to sign me an attestation so that I didn't have to go to work the next week, because I had no idea if I would've been able to otherwise. That poor woman didn't really know what to do with me though, pcp and analogs aren't the drugs they're used to treat their patients for. I kept monthly appointments with her for a few months until I got bored and stopped going.\n\nAnyway, the week after, at first I was still not completely back but it was less stressing having to deal with that at home that having to pretend to work and be normal. By the end of the week, I was completely back to baseline.\n\nBut it had been a hell of a ride. And after that  as the idiot I am, I've done other binges on pcp analogs that kept me several days to a week under the influence...\n\nNever tried 3-ho-pcp hole, that's not really what I'm looking for in that substance. Especially if you have to take >100mg doses. I couldn't do that on a week-end if I have to work afterwards because even if I know how to handle myself completely out of it at work and even get enough done that it doesn't seem strange, it's never a pleasant experience.\n\nOTOH, I've noticed that when you have a nice 3-ho-pcp buzz, a small dose of 2-oxo-pce will send you in a place that's kinda like the O-PCE hole only slightly different and pretty interesting. And that without having to take massive doses of a pcp analog that will have me coming down for the week to come.\n\nEDIT: just came back to say I have never eyeballed a pcp analog. I always weight them; and after the first big experience that went haywire, I now always keep a log where I put the date, hour, substance and dose I've taken every time I dose to keep track. It doesn't always prevent \"taking just another little bump to keep the fun going\" and going way over what would be reasonable. But at least, once my binge is over and I'm still completely out there, I can go back to my log and calculate how much I've done during that binge so I know what I can expect for the days to come.\n\nAnd then often I say to myself: \"fuck you past self, now I have to deal with that shit again just because you let yourself go with no consideration for my present self\".\n\nAnd then I stay clear for a few months until the itch comes back again and I order another batch promising myself I'll be careful this time.", "replies": {"g4ukr8v": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/iqlow8/always_check_drug_dosages_on_psychonaut_wiki/g4ukr8v/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1599877784.0, "body": "That was an incredible report.

I used the other ones at around the same dosage just to fall asleep, but bromaz has worked the best for me. I literally only use it for sleep, never recreation, and on the days I didn't work I would use trazodone, benadryl, a muscle relaxer etc... to fall asleep. The problem is all of those make me feel groggy as hell the next day and will put me out for like 10 hours and STILL make me groggy. My doctor won't prescribe me a non-benzo sleep aid like ambien, yet he gave me a xanax script as needed for sleep (which I rarely use, they don't really help me sleep as well as bromazolam, I just say they work so I can get it filled every 3-4 months). I have also tried kava kava, lavender, chamomile,  valerian root, weed, alcohol, but none of them put me to sleep at all. \n\n\nAll of this started last January, before then I could fall asleep at night no problem, but after my divorce and getting my life flipped turned upside down, I cannot fall asleep without aid (the divorce had nothing to do with drug use BTW, I started all these afterwords). I know theres a psychological part to it for sure, but my therapy sessions never lead to a relief in sleep, just helping me work through the process. \n\n\n\nAnyway, during this time I also picked up some psychs and I started using them around May-June of last year. At first, the trips were profound, I felt great afterwords and felt like I was making progress with my thoughts and I would feel great for two or three weeks aftet, but then I started tripping higher doses more frequently, and the thrill is gone. I can still trip, but theres no more profound thoughts or therapeutic value, they just make me feel funny and see the colors for a few hours, then I usually just take a benzo to fall asleep and that's the trip. Last time I took 4-HO-MET, about three weeks ago, I took 45mg, then two hours in I took 120mg to account for immediate tolerance to make my high last a little longer. Nothing was profound, that heroic dose barely added anything extra, I just felt like I took way too much of something and it gave me a headache. That's basically how my trips have been going. I am taking a break to reset my tolerance, but maybe the thrill is gone forever? \n\n\n\nSo if you've gotten this far, let's talk about how its affected my other use of substances. Ever since I started using benzos and psychs, It doesn't matter how much I drink, I don't fall asleep. I can mow down 13 drinks and I will just lay in bed, awake, feeling drunk and shitty wishing it made me pass out. It used to not be like this, I could have 3 beers and sleep like a baby. When I smoke weed, I just end up getting paranoid and all my lifes problems come tumbling down on top of me, I AGAIN don't fall asleep, and maybe the paranoia fades and I just feel high and it's kind of fun, but I won't fall asleep unless I use something.\n\n\n\nI don't know what to do anymore. I need to sleep to work my stressful 12 hour shifts, which have now ramped up to 7 days on 7 days off, and I will take around 2mg of bromaz a night to fall asleep and not feel like shit in the morning and get through the work day. This past week while I have been off, I have used a small dose of benzos every night to fall asleep instead of using my other means, I am going to end up on a 14 day straight stretch of use if I don't cool down. The use of these drugs have affected my sleep, they have affected how other substances affect me and I kind of feel like I am spiraling.\n\n\nThanks for reading.", "author": "Averagebass", "score": 96, "flair": null, "created": 1587170725.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/g35mtx/maybe_not_the_best_place_but_i_feel_like_rcs_have/", "num_comments": 97, "title": "Maybe not the best place, but I feel like RC's have screwed up a lot of my normal daily functions and ways other drugs act.", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fnpdx6l": {"score": 75, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/g35mtx/maybe_not_the_best_place_but_i_feel_like_rcs_have/fnpdx6l/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1587172609.0, "body": "Tripping is only profound when your intentions are set as such.

I take a small amount of benzos daily but I'm prescribed Klonopin PLUS ambien as needed PLUS an SSRI, all by one psychiatrist. They are much more drug friendly than doctors. But you have to decide for yourself if you want to be temporarily dependent on benzos or z drugs and if so, find a doctor or psychiatrist who is understanding and won't suddenly cut you off.

Way too addictive and toxic, and ime , acts more like a stimulant in many cases.  \n     Ive been there.  First thing is ditch the RC benzos.

Then start to taper.  Ive been on 20mg/day diazepam for yrs.   stable.  But when I switch to any other benzo.  Xanax , clonazalam , etc.  blackouts.  Car accidents.  Job loss.  Bad choices. Bad shit. \n      Exercise.  Exercise. And more exercise.  \n   I know it sounds counter productive, but consider a light stimulant to get u going in the AM, or PM if u work night shift.  Don\u2019t sit around.  Do calisthenics during lunch or if not active at work.

I feel like this disorder can be very mild and disguise itself in depression.  \n    I feel like I had it for yrs, which led to my benzo abuse /use.  \n    Maybe MDMA would be beneficial.  Maybe use it to candy flip.   ( first enjoyable trip I had in over 10yrs was after I was rolling and somebody gave me some acid , unplanned. ). \n   But regardless. I think u won\u2019t get anything out of these trips unless you take a long break and get the benzos out of your system a little. \n     Try ketamine in the meantime.  Do huge doses.  K hole.

Same with ketamine btw.  \n     Do some research ....  who really knows what these RCs do, or how pure they are.  \n     DMT is easily sourced. Safe.  I think it\u2019s even found in the human body.

That is just plain wrong according to several nembers and I apologize for being so blithe. Please do your own research uf you're looking for a dose equivalent amount of C-LAM to your benzo of choice. \n\nComing up on my 2nd year of an addiction that cost me my beautiful family, a nicely equipped workshop with pretty much every tool imaginable for building motorcycles (Italian bikes, my hobby), landscaping my property, and basic repair work on my families vehicles. Not to mention the $20,000 in my savings account (crazy how fast an addict blows through his or her cash) \n\nTL;DR: I lost everything, including some actual clothes on my back!\n\n*I want to quit. I'm so fucking over this lifestyle*. But it seems most people don't think im *actually* serious about quitting because I can't and won't do it without self medicating. Maybe I'm a coward... The first thing that I feel as the wd begins to take hold is dread. I'm terrified of 6 hours of dope sickness let alone 3 days. As most opioid addicts know, the mental and physical symptoms can only be called hell. Despite the \"experts\" and their; \"oh, its like having the flu\". Nope. It's not. It's a torture rack. Evsry cell in your body is off. Basic bodily functions like your respiratory and digestive systems are haywire. Your actual bone marrow hurts. Your mouth is sticky and dry, eyes and nose running like a sieve. Red hot pokers stabbing your guts, doubling you over, getting out of bed to retch and dry heave every ten minutes isn't an option so you puke in a bucket next to your bed. You may even literally shit the bed. You're in so much physical and emotional pain all you can do is thrash around in bed, gushing with sweat, obsessing over how awful you feel. \n\nTL;DR: Withdrawal is absolute hell.\n\nIf you've gotten this far, thank you for reading. Now plz listen to my plan... Critique it, add to it, ask questions, just please be helpful.\n\nI've decided to order copius amounts of clonozolam and a mild opiate such as kratom to take the edge off.. The \"kick a little at a time\" approach. I do believe I have what it takes to use the kratom responsibly and only if I absolutely can not sleep without it. The clonozolam is the key here tho - I wanna be so zonked out on benzo sedatives that my RLS, mental terrors, all the actual fear is gone. I plan to load up on the kratom plus high doses of C-LAM, and by day number 3 continue the fight with just C-LAM, seroquel, and clonidine. Get myself to the point where I can transition to the pure buprenorphine pills I have stashed away.\n\nSo before I go shopping for RC's... I have about $500 I can spend. Looks like I can get a TON of most rc benzos dirt cheap... $350 for 500 mg of clonozolam, and from whst I read the clonozolam - clonozepam dose conversion is almost equal mg for mg. Are there other benzos I should be considering, maybe something closer to alprazolam that hits harder and faster? \n\nI already know what many of you are thinking - I'm going to trade a massive fent addiction for a deadly benzo addiction. And that will be true... at first. I've kicked enormous kpin and xanax habits before by tapering, and tapering off benzo is nbd to me bc I don't particularly care for them (benzos). They have zero recreational value to me. My last bout was scoring a womens stash of 1mg kpins she was selling - a years stash - 400 1mg blues. Developed a 12-15 mg/day habit. When I noticed my bag was getting low I quickly tapered my 10-15mg habit down to 5-10 within a month, then found a psych who gave me 3mg a day. I was fine. These rc benzos will be strictly for making my wd suck less, but I have no illusions that I'll instantly be fine on 2mg afterwards (assuming I conquer my fent habit). So please, just give me the benefit of the doubt that I'll be able to keep my benzo use under control.\n\nWell then... I have C-LAM as my benzo of choice, kratom as my parachute... Anything else I should add to this cocktail?\n\nPretty sad that I'm doing this much planning and drug shopping to get through what's essentially about 40 hours, long enough to get back on subs. What can I say, I'm a wuss.\n\nSuggestions for alternative benzos and other RC's that may stimulate the opioid receptors would be great. If only *I can just fucking get a little sleep* I think I can conquer this. Being wide fucking awake for 3 agonizing days and knowing $20 worth of dope will end the misery is not an easy thing to do.\n\nThank you all for reading this and for your input.

Because these are all just drugs they would give you there. Except not propranolol. \n\nThey typically prescribe you gabapentin, clonidine, hydroxyzine, and a little bit of valium in my experience. \n\nI would use all of those, and then add some\nOtc meds.

I would never kick without kratom on hand. Some people have had success with Imodium, but I personally wouldn\u2019t use it with the purpose of alleviating withdrawals, it\u2019s also dangerous in high dosages and can induce extremely bad cardiovascular damage when taking high dosages for long periods of time.

That\u2019s why I listed so many alternatives. Getting into a suboxone program with a licensed physician is somewhat hard and expensive to do, and most psychiatrists aren\u2019t even allowed to give subscripts. You can find a licensed one near you on suboxone.com. \n\nThe quickest, easiest, and least expensive method would be to ask your doctor or psychiatrist to write you the scripts for those 4 detox drugs up above. Or just the first 3 and substitute propranolol for Valium if the doc is uncomfortable with benzos. and be upfront that they are for detoxing off of opioids. I\u2019ve never had a doctor argue or say anything. Then on your own, get the otc meds, supplements, vitamins, and Kratom.

Holding under the tongue for ten minutes and swallowing. I think about a two hours in, I'm going to start bumping 5-15mg bits of 5-MAPB until where I want to be. I say 5-15mg because, you know, Gemini. I've done the MAPB several times, up to a dose of 70 mg insufflated, and I've only mixed these two at a dose of 200mcg ALD and 70mg MAPB. Didn't end well. Trying again with smaller doses, obviously.   \n\nI'm going to let this ride until the two hours, then I'm going to try updating every hour/half hour, depending on how exciting things are. Wish me luck!  \n\nT0:25 (10:57) Change of plans, boys. 500mg phenibut in some water and down the hatch. Tempted to take another tab, but now I'm just being greedy.  \n\nT0:54 (11:24) Acting a fool because it hasn't hit yet, and put another 100mcg tab under my tongue. I'm not an idiot, I'm an addict. Only half joking.  \n\nT1:57 (12:29) Come up anxiety (second tab, first tab is very active) on top of normal anxiety on top of trying a new combo anxiety. . . Mmmmm, just right. ~10mg 5-MAPB up the snooter before I lose my nerve.  \n\nT2:01 (12:33) The rest of the 20mg weighed MAP goin' in. Too impatient.  \n\nGeneral edit (12:55) I just want to thank everyone for your support, whether you're following out of interest or because you want to watch a trainwreck. It's all very entertaining and means a lot! I'm just going to be way too out of it to say this to each person going forward.  \n\nT2:27 (12:58) Aside from usual acid effects, this music sounds fucking incredible. I'm also noticing an odd visual that I don't notice with lysergamides themselves; everything seems to have a translucent film of itself that can operate independent of the real \"layer\". Immense amount of body tension that turns into pure physical euphoria when I dance. I can't dance, but I'll be damned if that stops this. 30 more milligrams of MAPB lined up, about to sniff half and see what happens, which would bring me to a total of ~45mg ingested AS OF this update. Feeling PHENOMENAL, hope it keeps up.  \n\nAnyone else have that problem with psychs where you permanently feel like you have to shit but you can't shit? Just me? Hope not.  \n\n1:18 AM  Fuck the T0:00 nonsense. This is why I included the legit time from the outset. Big brain before I knew I needed my brain to be that big. And ignore my shitty fractions. I did indeed measure out 30mg, but half in addition to the initial 20mg would be 35 and not 45. MY BAD. But it doesn't matter, because I just added it for the full 50mg.   \n\nI feel amazing. The phenibut I can't say I feel, but that's perfect. It doesn't seem to be impacting anything except to take the anxious edge off. Fantastic, amazing. Though I wish I knew how much ramping up the doses helped in terms of making this manageable. Phenbut aside, I'm only 20mg short on the MAPB from my previous experience, and that was 100% overwhelming. Feel like I could talk forever, moving is generally euphoric, my playlist can't miss at this point.  \n\n1:31 AM Feeling too cocky I guess, another 15-20mg MAPB insufflated.   \n\nDrug total over the past 3 hours: 200mcg ALD-52, ~65-70mg 5-MAPB, 500mg phenibut  \n\nCouldn't feel fucking better. Gonna take this show on the road; charging up my phone, got some emergency Xanax in the pocket, gotta bring myself a bottle of water. But I know myself a swingset in the middle of town, that's MY swingset. I've seen only one other person at this time, EVER, in almost a decade. \n\nAight, I'mma head out  \n\n1:37 AM Decided to make this slightly more scientific. My setting is generally an ACed room, and my activity has been some jamming around the house to my tunes. Just took my temp with a shitty walgreens thermometer: 99.3 F/37.4C  \n\nCould be worse, could be better, all things considered. Let me know if I should be worried, I don't feel like I should be.  \n\n2:00 AM CAN\u2019T EVEN FUCKING LEAVE, forgot my water, and now I\u2019ve got a friend texting me. Still euphoric, I can\u2019t even be frustrated, but agh my plans  \n\n2:16 AM I feel an intense openness and bond with my friend texting me and the redditor who reached out in DMs, but it\u2019s really fucking hard to read specifics and reply meaningfully. Can only communicate in feelings, you feel? But what I feel is still amazing. There\u2019s a smoothness and openness the ALD lacks on its own. Visuals aren\u2019t what I expected them to be, but they\u2019re there. Contrary to lysgeramide tracers, my entire field of vision has a tracer. It\u2019s cool. Physical tension seems to have gone! But again, phenibut.   \n\nFinally leaving my fucking house!\n\n2:27 AM Nah, no walk. Weather is iffy and I don\u2019t feel like prepping for it. My playlist and small movements are all I need to be the happiest person in the world. SCHOCKINGLY nonvisual, though. All headspace.  \n\n2:43 AM deciding I\u2019m in for the night and getting undressed was absolutely divine. The 5-MAPB is rather sedating, anyway, so I\u2019m in pure bliss laying around, texting, and listening to music.  \n\n3:08 AM Feels like things have evened off and are starting to calm down. Feel like I\u2019ve gotten the idea of what mixing these two is like, except for the phenibut. The trip report idea was secondary to deciding to have an interesting evening. So hopefully it isn\u2019t tainted too much if I start vaping some cannabis.  \n\n3:39 AM Just stoned now, I guess. Very relaxed. Miiiiiild stimulation, less than what I\u2019d expect from ALD-52 alone. It\u2019s been increasingly clear what impact the phenibut had on this experience. I mean, by all things that are good am I glad I took it, but it harms the spirit of a report like this. Subtle trippiness is still seeping its way in to my bubble of comfort.  \n\n4:02 AM I think the MAPB is more or less going. I still feel great, but not as much balls to the walls euphoria. Just general lysergamide \u201clife is good\u201d feeling. Very relaxed. Way too relaxed, honestly, though I guess that\u2019s not much of a complaint. I FEEL like I could sleep, but I know I couldn\u2019t at this point.   \n\nThink I\u2019m gonna wait until the ALD exerts the last bit of its magic and then hit the benzos because I have to\nbe up and back at work tomorrow. Which will be fucking weird. I wasn\u2019t expecting to have this profound of an experience overnight. I was just looking to replace my usual line of dissos, because I ran out.  \n\n4:19 AM Holy fucking shit I\u2019m hungry. I went into this with a mostly empty stomach. Even so, I\u2019m surprised, I can\u2019t usually eat on psychedelics, much less psychedelic stimulants. The MAPB must be wearing off for sure.  \n\nJust got up to piss. Woweeeee, yep, there\u2019s definitely a trip still going on. Not a ton, the lights are gorgeous, a bit of breathing walls and such. Mwah.  \n\n4:31 AM Despite hunger, eating is posing an issue still. Forcing yogurt and peanuts in my face despite its best efforts   \n\nShould just be the rest of the trip, benzo, bed. Thanks for hanging, everyone! This has been such a blast, from the bottom of my heart.   \n\nI may still be around, but this concludes the report.  \n\nFor completion\u2019s sake: 5:30AM, 2mg flualprazolam. Night y\u2019all. Hopefully.  \n\n5:48: Sleep? Nah. Barred the fuck out with visuals and musical appreciation?

I took high doses of two chemicals (one of which I had never taken before), I didn't tell anyone what I was doing, I tripped when I had things to do the next day, and I did it impulsively while in a bad mindset. I don't typically write trip reports except when I find myself experiencing particularly strange things, and I want to write this down before it eludes me even more.\n\nTldr: took a lot of drugs and misevaluated my dose, had an extremely intense experience that I was not prepared for, but hopefully have learned more than a few lessons from it\n\nI'm a 23 year old Male with pretty extensive experience with psychedelics. Especially LSD, DMT, and DPT, my highest dose of LSD being 500ug. I've had mostly good experiences with some bad ones, but nothing could have prepared me for this.\n\nI recently found myself in possession of a few grey market analogues I had never tried and was very excited. I tried the 4-Aco first at 20mg, and was pleased with it. It was nothing overbearing and I enjoyed it, and was able to fall asleep about 6 hours later. I planned to try it at a higher dose 2 days later with some friends and my girlfriend, with the intention of upping my dose to account for the tolerence I had just given myself. Tripping more than once a week or two is not something I usually do, but I found myself too excited to try these new chemicals to stop myself. I've had pretty serious problems with addiction since I first started doing drugs, and thus have limited myself to taking only psychedelics. I find my compulsions still bleed over into my use of psychedelics as well sometimes, unfortunately. \n\nThe next night after a somewhat exhausting night at work, I found myself getting into a pretty bad fight with my girlfriend. This is nothing too unusual considering our relationship has been pretty fucked up lately. She left, and I stewed for a bit and decided I would trip tonight, because fuck what everyone else thinks. I knew this might be a mistake, but I figured my tolerence would be so bad it probably wouldn't be very strong anyway. All things considered, I had the supply to up my dose. I took 2 and a half tabs of ETH-LAD, a chemical I had never taken up to this point. If it wasn't very strong, I would boost with some extra 4-Aco-DMT.  \n\nI waited an hour. I definitely felt the ETH-LAD, but as expected, my tolerence was definitely not helping the intensity. I listened to some of my favorite video game OSTs and noticed the walls shimmering. This chemical certainly does have a noticable difference in it's visuals to headspace ratio compared to LSD. I even felt the body load and nausea that other people have noted with this chemical, too, but it was nothing too debilitating. I waited 30 more minutes and did not feel a significant ramp-up in intensity. Thus, it was time to boof some 4-Aco-DMT. \n\nI had some anxiety about how much to dose. I wanted to blast off as much as I could, but I had no idea how much to use because of how many factors were at play. I have found when dosing DPT in the middle of an LSD trip it has been sometimes less intense than expected, presumably because of the cross tolerence between the LSD and DPT. However, I have never really noticed this issue when smoking DMT on the peak of an LSD trip. I came to the conclusion that I would probably need more than expected, and weighed out 75mg. I turned my music off, and commenced the boofing. \n\nOne minute later, two minutes later... I thought maybe even that wasn't enough. A few minutes later and I started to wonder if it was going to work at all. When boofing I typically feel it in a minute or two, but I felt nothing different. Sure enough, moments after thinking this, I had no idea what was happening. The effects of the 4-Aco-DMT did not remind me of my shroom experiences, but more of my experiences with smoking DMT while on LSD. It was as if I was instantly transported to a \"tryptamineverse\" where everything in my room looked basically the same but just somehow completely different at the same time. The only way I know how to describe it is that it feels as if I had been dropped into a slightly tweaked version of my room. A place where \"me\" and \"my room\" were spaced out caricatures of themselves. \n\nI sat in my computer chair. This was much, much more than I bargained for, and it was still ramping up. I scrambled for something to put on my screen before I lost my ability to think but it was already rapidly deteriorating. I tried to catch my breath. I thought.. if I could just stay at this level I will be fine. When did I boof this strange drug? I looked at the time on my computer and yep, sure enough, the numbers didnt make sense at all. I started at the time, trying to make sense of it while the terror inside me continued to grow, and the intensity of the drug grew by the moment. I decided I had to lay down, and I had to think of some music to listen to before I did because any moment now it was going to be impossible to type. I managed to pull up \"OK Computer\" by Radiohead before collapsing onto my bed. A strange choice, but it was all I could think of.\n\nThe next part of the experience is extremely difficult to remember and even more difficult to describe. I tried my best not to fight it, but the experience went to some very dark places and it wasn't something I could control. It was as if my mind was attempting to analyze and judge every single mistake I had ever made and trying to repair the origin of said mistake. I would ask myself why I decided to compulsively take these research chemicals in such high doses and the question would be reverse engineered in my head, not in the normal \"self-narritive\" sense, but simply in feeling. I would feel self hatred for myself for taking such a high dose of drugs, but also complete compassion for myself for having experienced such trauma in my childhood and even adult life that would lead me to do such a thing. There are memories that I have not thought of for as long as I can remember that played out in my \"minds eye\" during this, and were visually represented by symbols and patterns that I saw as CEVs. Some of these memories weren't even my own, but of people that I knew, and some were memories of people that I have never met. \n\nThis went on for what felt like maybe an hour, and then I was suddenly pulled out of the experience by an ad on youtube in between songs. I looked at my computer screen, and noticed the first song on the album had ended. I felt intense dread. How would I make it through this? I wanted it to end so bad. How could I make it stop? I had no xanax, no antipsychotics. I could call 911, but no... absolutely not, I could not do that. But what if I lost control and decided it was the only thing that could be done? I imagined having police and paramedics in my room during this experience and felt so much terror. No, there is no choice but to ride it out. I knew I would possibly feel a lessening of intensity in about an hour, but the only way I could relatively tell the time was by the music. The last song had felt like a lifetime. \n\nI laid in my bed and tried my best to clench my teeth and not freak out. I knew not to fight the experience, but I absolutely could not enjoy it. The substances I had taken were providing me with a degree of introspection that I simply was not prepared for. Every muscle in my body was clenched. The body load was quite intense and I felt like I could barely move. The inside of my mouth felt alien, and for some reason I tasted a hint of the distinct taste of DMT. I wanted water but found myself unable to move or even remember to move long enough to be able to. The only thing I could really remember was my name, and that I was high as balls, although at times I had no way of understanding what that meant. I heard the lyrics to the third song on the album, \"Subterranean Homesick Alien\" The lyrics are: \n\n\"I'll tell all my friends but they'll never believe me/ they'll think that I've finally lost it completely.\" \n\nI wept when I heard this, knowing that this was my experience and mine only. Lost in infinity and terror, with no one to help.\n\nAt some point, after what felt like hours and hours, the album was ended and I opened my eyes. I wasn't in a hospital bed or jail cell, and I was alive. Sections of my ceiling spun in different directions, symbols moved across my wall. I felt columns of 3 dimensional blocks in my head move into place, as if my brain was attempting to learn something now. The thought occured to me that I was going to be okay, that I had made it through, and I laughed. My visual field was still covered in OEVs, my head was still swimming, and my body was still aching and covered in sweat, but the intensity had lessened. I yawned. I was actually getting tired, somehow! \n\nI stared at my ceiling and felt a strange catharsis that I had made through it without doing something incredibly stupid, and felt stronger for having done it. I promised myself to take a break from psychedelics and attempt to more deeply understand this experience before delving in again. A thought occured to me very loudly, and I sat at my computer and opened notepad and typed the sentence \"When the universe was born, I was there.\" I felt the experience fading from my memory by the minute but decided I was too tired to write any more, and fell asleep a couple hours later.\n\nThat's about it. Sorry I'm so long winded. I wish I could remember more. One of the strange things is that even though this is the most intense psychedelic experience I've had, I was keenly aware of the fact that I was just scratching the surface, that many many people before me have gone much further than this.

I don't care!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I don't think what you did was wrong.* You were just unprepared for the results. This can be beneficial in my opinion as it eliminates any expectations you may have going into it.\n\nYou did the only thing you could and hunkered down in bed and stressed. I've sweated. It's tight and jarring. Hypertensive. Completely insane!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The dose...**\n\nSo, as far as I know, taken orally 4-AcO-DMT at 8mg increments is equivalent to 1 gram of mushrooms.\n\nTaking 4-AcO-DMT up the pooper... This route of administration speeds up the onset greatly, usually intensifies the experience and compresses the trip making it shorter. These factors tend to make 8mg of 4-AcO-DMT anally equal to more like 1.25 gram of mushrooms more or less.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoing the math, **you basically took 12 grams** of the finest dried mushrooms you can get. That's lots. Not knowing what 12 grams feels like and doing it unexpectedly, with the electric intensity of LSD thrown into the mix...\n\n# Wow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext time you'll know! Plan for it. Give yourself 2 weeks to baseline. No less than 7 days if you can. Skip boofing it as in my opinion it shortens the fun. Make your setting clean and tidy as an exercise in meditation. Eat little to nothing 6 hours before dosing.\n\n**Other tips:**\n\n1. blackout your setting, as in **zero light**... OEV = CEV... the visuals take you to where you ought to be IMHO, and where that place is isn't always fun or joyous\n2. make a introspective playlist... **music about the self**... I *love* Radiohead and Beck and Bjork... I've listened to the psychedelic 60's, a Pink Floyd playlist is in my future or even a classical music list with Bach, Vivaldi, Wagner and Strauss? Lol \n3. **stop thinking** / talking to yourself... be alone and let **you** go... it's 5-6 hours on the 4-AcO-DMT... that's approximately only 10% of a full week of woken ego-filled hours... just accept to become lost for these few precious hours of your week\n4. **sit still**... use your composure, **self-discipline**, try to \"suffer\" if you want to call it that... yeah go to the bathroom, but reluctantly... just stay very still, like you are dead\n5. understand that you won't be able to replicate your trip results then next time you trip... **preconceived expectations will dull the effect**... you will trip hard if you dose heavy is all you can expect, but the outcome will not be similar from trip to trip and just accept that\n6. **it's okay to be scared**, filled with terror, elated, euphoric, creepy, freaked-out... IMHO feeling this way at times throughout the trip is a benefit... it allows you to examine your demons and hang-ups after you come down and hopefully for days later... when you're out-of-your-mind insane, you can look back at you and see your issues 'out of the box'!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I loved your report.

Psychedelics can have a very moody, dark, and saddening tone to them in my experience. The most upbeat and euphoric trips I have had was when I took psychedelics after drinking alcohol or after taking a Xanax. It completely takes the edge off but made the experience less dark and more fun.

I told my doc and he came up with a great taper plan. It was working great. I was waiting for my last shipment to come in and BAM covid19 hit. My packs are still stuck in NY customs. So I turned to.... I don\u2019t even know what you want to call it. I\u2019ll just call it Darkness to order stuff that can help me with my w/d\u2019s. I told my doc about the shipment not being able to get here ( he\u2019s Indian and of the older generation- totally not racist or prejudice) BUT, I don\u2019t think he fully understood the extent of my addiction. I was down to 9 mg of the 3 mg Etiz pills a day, and felt great. \n\nI needed him to help me. He prescribed me fucking Librium. He knows that 3 mg of Etiz is equal to 2 mg of Xanax. He was the one that told me that. 10 mg llibrium 3x daily for a week or whenever the fuck he feels like weening down to two pills. I tried it. I was so sick.

I only stayed there for three days. The only reason why they kept me was because I had oxy in my system which I don\u2019t even do. I\u2019m on vivitrol. So I basically sat there for three days. They would give me 2 25 mg libs every four hours. That\u2019s another story.  I ended up leaving. So, I had been ordering 60 ml flualp 2 mg/ml I think then I have clonazolam 60 ml 1mg/ml. I also have 1 mg flualp candies. About like 70 of those. I had those stashed away because I was only going to detox appease my roommate and bf.  \n\nGuys I don\u2019t know what to do.

Swap out your short/medium half life benzos for diclazepam over the course of a week and then taper the diclazepam. It can be done, it doesn't really suck too much to do so (maybe a bit of insomnia, but oh well), and you certainly DON'T need to do a 1:5 dosage conversion like whatever that bullshit online benzo calculator tells you.\n\n9mg/day of etizolam can more than likely be subbed 1:1 for 9mg/day diclazepam, and you'll actually start building up diclaz in your system because it lingers for longer than a day - so you could probably hop down to less and still be OK. You're gonna wanna do an actual taper though. You're not getting clean over a weekend. I'd recommend ~5 days to switch from etizolam to diclazepam (Drop your etiz dose down 2mg a day, and bump your diclaz dose up to 2mg a day. If you want, toward the end of that transition period, you can \"front-load\" some diclazepam up to like 1.5 your normal dose, so ~15mg, but once you switch over to diclaz only you're gonna drop that right back down to normal, in your case 9mg, or less). Then just do a linear regression in steps of 18 (9.0, 8.5, 8.0,...) and drop your dose down by that much (in this case 0.5mg) every 4 days.

I have little personal experience with benzos, yet I researched a lot. All the benzos I ever took were stolen from my relatives, but I made sure they don\u2019t need them. \n\nI have taken Alprazolam, Diazepam, Lorazepam, Lormetazepam and Nitrazepam.  I\u2019m not gonna get into details. I enjoyed Alprazolam and Diazepam the most. Yet Xanax felt a lot better than Diazepam for me. Was more sedating, euphoric, better muscle relaxer and it gave me that no fucks given feeling I never got on other benzos. \n\nBy that I don\u2019t mean I did anything stupid, it\u2019s just that it not only relieved my anxiety, but I literally gave 0 fucks about any of my other life problems. Ironically, I knew if I did something stupid I wouldn\u2019t care, lol. But I\u2019m pretty good at controlling myself when my inhibitions are lowered, as I always think I shouldn\u2019t do something I wouldn\u2019t do sober. Such a great euphoria as well. Way better than Diazepam (I know people may contradict me on this one, but that\u2019s just how I felt). \n\nSo I\u2019m looking for a strong, euphoric RC which compares to Xanax the most. The first on my list is Clonazolam. What\u2019s your opinions on this one? I read that it\u2019s very addicting but I believe I can control myself. I once asked how can I take Xanax responsibly to avoid withdrawals and someone told me taking for 7 days, then having a 10 days break it\u2019s gonna be fine. \n\nDoes this go with Clonazolam as well? I\u2019ve also heard it rises up your tolerance a lot, but how much? Is it that bad if I don\u2019t abuse it?

I have low tolerance and my use has never gotten to the point where withdrawals are activated by stopping.  As soon as I feel a tolerance developing I stop and/or switch to a different anxiolytic.  For me, they are about equipotent, but Etizolam has a more even and predictable dose response curve, so it's easier to get the dose right if I want less or more.  I usually take .5 mg of either.  Tolerance to Xanax builds immediately.  Tolerance to Etizolam, assuming a start from zero, goes into a reverse at first, meaning you reduce the dose to achieve the same effect, and then after about two weeks returns to base and starts to build. This means, to me, Etizolam is safer to to use to get through a particularly anxious patch.  I would say Etizolam is better in regards to memory effects as well.  I would also say Etizolam handles anxiety more efficaciously than Xanax.  The same dose of Xanax may eliminate anxiety as efficiently as Etizolam, but at the additional cost of making me stupid.

I also take Xanax someone\u2019s but diclazepam has been what I\u2019ve been abusing bad lately. I\u2019m also on dexedrine 10mg 4x a day.

I would like to get one for panic attacks (I dont have them often but when I do they are pretty bad), preferably a fairly strong one that kicks in quick (length of effect doesnt matter, I'd only be using it to kill a panic attack)\n2. One that is better for \"all day\" anxiety. I don't plan to take them daily at all but I do have mild anxiety daily. I am able to deal with it quite well unless for some reason its a very stressful day, but I would like to have something to take on days I know will be stressful on my anxiety. (For instance, most saturdays are hell on Earth at my job, going to a huge social event, etc). It doesn't have to be strong, but I would prefer it to last most of the day without having to redose.\n\nFor the first one, I was thinking flualprazolam as it is closely related to xanax(which I have heard is great for stopping a panic attack asap) though Im unsure of its duration.\n\nSecond one I was thinking maybe etizolam though a few others, maybe diclaz?\n\nThe vendor I found currently(though if there's other RCs I should consider, I wouldn't mind finding a new vendor) offers:\n\n* Diclazepam\n* Etizolam\n* Clonazolam\n* Flubromazolam\n* Flualprazolam\n\nThank you so much for all your time if you read and answer this!\n\n(P.S. Just for curiousity sake, what benzo is the most euphoric? If I wanted one to take before a party (I dont drink), which would you choose? I rarely go out \\[even before corona\\] due to anxiety.

I'M NOT A DOCTOR AND I'M ONLY TRYING TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE KEEPING THEM AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE.\n\n*AGE*: 21\n\n*BODY WEIGHT*: 64.2\n\n**INITIAL REMARKS:**\n\n* I'm pretty experienced with a wide sort of substances (from stimulants to downer).\n* I'm an athlete so my average heart rate is closer to 40 bpm.\n* Before the experience i had a light breakfats (a large cup of tea).\n* I was well rested and the day before I went to bed at 11.30/00.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**9:20 am**\n\n*Body* *temperature:* 35.8\u00b0\n\nI've been awake for 1 hour. I assume orally an unkonwn dose (approximately between 50mg and 100mg, very likely to be closer to 50) of 3-FMA for studying its effects on productivity. The method of taking is dissolving the substance in a cup of water and drink it down the hatch. Nasty flavour.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**9:40 am**\n\nI got the hoover over y room. I don't think it's caused by the substance but more by a placebo effect caused by the fact that I want to be productive today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**9:46 am**\n\nI'm starting to feel a general feeling of well- being. Very mild, i don't know if it's caused by th substance itself (seen the short time passed from the assumption).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Editor note: *from here i started to write all the sentences in uppercase while, before,  I wrote them in lowercase*)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**9:50 am**\n\nI think that I'm starting to feel the effect : it's pleasant and satisfactory. The effect may recall the effect of cocaine, but less powerful( I can hazard something around 1/10th). Im starting to feel my heart rate increasing but I don't have a anything to measure it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**10:00 am**\n\nThe effect is surely positive. I've started to clench the jaw, as expected. I went outside and bring something in my garage (*that is in my own building but the access is from the street.)* In my opinion I was trying to find something to do in fact the thing that i brought to my garage wasn't actually so important. I just felt the urge to do something and going outside.\n\n(Editor note: *I found a pressure gauge in my garage so from now on I'll start to add also heart rate and blood pressure)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**10:21 am**\n\n*Blood Pressure:* 179/98\n\n*Heart rate:* 78 bpm\n\n1 hour has passed, the peak should be now or very soon. While doing things on pc for the university  I am listening music. Listening to music it's very enjoyable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**10:43 am**\n\n*Body* *temperature:* 36.5\u00b0\n\nThe more time was passing the more I was turning on so I tried to masturbate but my penis couldn't erect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**11:01 am**\n\n*Blood Pressure:* 184/110\n\n*Heart rate:* 112\n\nThe effect is definitely pleasant and invigorating.  I really enjoy chatting with other people on social media.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**11:41 am**\n\n*Body* *temperature:* 37\u00b0\n\nThe \"peak effect\" is lasting surprisingly more than I expected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**12:24 pm**\n\n*Body* *temperature:* 37.1\n\n(Editor note: *I didn't report anything out of my body temperature because I was following  online classes so there was nothing to report)*\n\n**12:52 pm**\n\n*Heart rate:* 106 bpm\n\nI followed the lesson while listening to music (first time doing it). The euphoria has lasts during all the lesson (started at 11 and finished at 13). Writing is pretty difficult (*not writing itself but I wrote very fast so what i writing was very difficult to read).* I played a videogame and I found myself very in shape.\n\n**2:14 pm**\n\n*Blood Pressure:* 194/111\n\n*Heart rate:* 109 bpm\n\nThe bruxism and the high are lasting (maybe the high is a little bit lower)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3:17 pm**\n\n*Body* *temperature:* 36.5\u00b0\n\nThe high is starting to come down (that is understandable after 6 hours)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3:44 pm**\n\n*Body* *temperature:* 36.8\u00b0\n\nI think that the effect is totally over but my body temperature is still higher than usual.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5:03 pm**\n\n*Body* *temperature:* 37.0\u00b0\n\nThe effect is officially over and the comedown is starting to kick in: I feel a little down but compared to other substance's comedown it's pretty light.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**8:50 pm**\n\n*Body* *temperature:* 37.0\u00b0\n\nI'm a little bit tense and for how I'm feeling right now is very likely that I won't sleep tonight. The heart beat is still higher than usual.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**10:03 pm**\n\n*Body* *temperature:* 37.0\u00b0\n\nMy heart beat keeps being higher than my average one but not constantly: When there are frenetic moments, for example while playing videogames, the heart rate increase too much compared to the normally increase it should have.\n\n**2 am**\n\n*I had to take half of a xanax for sleeping beacuse I couldn't fall asleep.*\n\n**Following morning**\n\n*My heart rate is still higher than usual but my body temperature is normal. I woke up at 8.40 with almost  no hangover. I feel a little tired but I'm pretty sure is because I slept roughly 6 hours.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FINAL CONSIDERATION:**\n\n* Surely this substance is worth a shot but consider the very long duration of it.\n* I don't recomend  the usage of this substance if you suffer of high blood pressure.\n* Being very similar to amphetamine your appetite will be suppresed: I skipped lunch and ate a very light dinner. Don't follow my example and strive to eat something even though you are not hungry at all. \n* To avoid damaging the internal part of your mouth for the bruxism (that wasn't so heavy for me, but it changes from person to person) take some magnesium before you take your dose.\n* Stay hydrated. Always. It's very important to drink almost a cup of water per hour to avoid brain damages caused by the raising of your body temperature. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading this, be safe and use your head, always. \n\nRemember that sometimes less is more.\n\nIf you have any question or advice feel free too ask!", "author": "lumpierzaro1234", "score": 12, "flair": null, "created": 1587863362.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/g7x3jn/report_on_3fma_for_research_purposes/", "num_comments": 26, "title": "REPORT ON 3-FMA FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fokd0kg": {"score": 6, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/g7x3jn/report_on_3fma_for_research_purposes/fokd0kg/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1587868585.0, "body": "I also was surprised with **3-FMA** .

Obviously I made huge mistakes I understand that! Please don\u2019t troll! in a couple parts \nPart 1. This is for the person out there that wants to take Clonazolam either regularly or just for anxiety. \nPart 2. This is a cautionary tale for those who think they have a high tolerance to Benzos. \nPart 3. For those who have not done extensive research prior to taking this chemical.\n\nTo begin... I have suffered from anxiety issues my whole adult life and would get brief relief from Klonopin, Xanax and Valium. I have been an addict of all types of substances from heroin, Valium, meth all the way to ketamine. So I started to do research on this substance and others like it. I thought this could be a good substitute for Xanax or Klonopin. I purchased 500mg of Clonazolam in pill form. I received the package on Monday I needed to drop off my father so I waited to take it. Thinking this would take 10-15 minutes to kick in I took it after I dropped my father off and about 30 minutes from my house. I took 1 pill and 30 minutes later ended up taking 2 more (huge mistake!!!) then the next thing I remember it was Thursday morning. I woke up in my bed my wife wasn\u2019t anywhere to be found. My left eye felt like it was swollen so I walked into the bathroom and saw a giant black eye completely purple. You have to keep in mind that I have blacked out before on alcohol or mixing other drugs. I have never blacked out for 2 days str8 before! I had absolutely no regard for my life or others. From what I\u2019ve been told I was dodging traffic in the middle of the freeway. (After my wife suspected I took something and found my 100 pill stash in my backpack I became belligerent after finding out she took them) I pleaded with her that I would do anything for my pills. So she agreed to give me 2 pills if I went to detox. I said yes but never made it. The police had been called numerous times. Once after my wife convinced me to take a bath. I got naked and never made it in the bath but was apparently running through traffic naked. Long story short I will not be going down this path again because for me personally. I could have easily awakened in a jail cell with homicide charges and not remembered a thing. I believe from what my wife has said I took 6-7 pills after the initial 3 I took. I have a long ways to go about making this up to my wife and my father. (I accused my father of taking my pills) (my wife off abusing me) I was absolutely out of Control.

I could barely find any information on this substance (no psychonaut-wiki page, barely any reagent test results), and a method to administer the powder sublingually without blotter paper (because I didn't buy tabs) wasn't easy to find as well. Here I will write down what I learned.\n\n* 1) Reagent testing\n\nAfter searching for a long time, I found 2 previous reagent test results: \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/rUO4tOH.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/y9IU99J.jpg\n\nHere is the result of my reagent test:\nhttps://imgur.com/baO4SMZ\n\n(I tested using Marquis (MQ), Mecke (MC), Mandelin (MN) and Froehde (FR))\n\nAs you can see: quite similar to the other results. Marquis barely any change in color, a dark color with Mecke and dark-ish yellow with Mandelin.\n\n* 2) Administration\n\nI created a 10mg/mL solution in 96% ethanol. I stored this in a brown 10mL medicine bottle that I bought at the pharmacist. It looked like this:\nhttps://imgur.com/ghU2RLW\n\nThe picture isn't very clear, but I wanted to illustrate that it dissolved without any problems (gave it a warm bath in my sink for about 2 minutes, shook it and it dissolved immediately). Then, I took a tiny piece of kitchen paper, about the size of 2 regular tabs, and with an oral syringe measured out 0.2 mL (so 2mg). It leaked a little through the kitchen paper, so my \"tabs\" weren't big enough probably, but most of it stayed on. I let it evaporate for 2 hours and then put it in aluminium foil to bring it to the trip location.\n\nOnce I got there, I put it between my lip and my lower gums. I did not taste anything (oddly enough, I heard it tastes foul). Me being stupid tried smoking a spliff while the piece of paper was in my mouth, and this didn't really work since lot's of saliva built up due to keeping the paper in my mouth and I didn't wanna swallow because I feared I'd lose potency. Anyway: just keep it in your mouth, sublingual or buccal or at your gums, and wait about 15-20 minutes. A small piece touched my tongue the whole time, and I could feel that part of my tongue go numb. Like after going to the dentist. This part stayed numb for about the entire duration of my trip.\n\n* 3) Trip \"report\"\n\nI have never really made a trip report, but I'll write down some things I noticed.\n\nSet and setting: at the studio of a friend of mine together with another girlfriend of mine (/ours). She just got dumped by her boyfriend, and since our friend is single, she appearently couldn't wait to get it on with him. The fact that she was on 2C-B didn't help (or well, did help). I should've called off the trip as soon as I noticed what was going on because the sexual tension between the two of them was palpable so it was just awkward for me (more on that later on). Also, we dropped around 5pm and I had to catch a bus to go to Amsterdam at 7am the next morning. In conclusion: set and setting were far from ideal, rookie mistake. My friend took 100ug of 1P-LSD, and the female friend took 20mg of 2C-B, as mentioned before.\n\nTrip itself:\nTotal duration was about 8 hours. We dropped at 5pm. By 11pm the comedown started, I was almost back to baseline by 1am. As you all know, with psychedelics the trip never really \"stops\" until you get some sleep. I went to sleep by 3am, \"sleep\" because my mind was racing and I was saving my Xanax for when I got on the bus about 4 hours later.\n\nIf you were to tell me I had taken LSD, I probably would have believed you. To me, it felt very LSD-like, with only a couple of small differences: Less bodyload (peeing on LSD is almost impossible for me, on 25E-NBOH it went just fine), more intense visuals (never seen a carpet wave like that). Euphoria was similar and it was very energetic. The numbness of my tongue bothered me quite a lot though. Headspace was less than with LSD, I don't really feel like I learned anything from this trip, while after an LSD trip I feel like I learned loads of things. That is why I think it lends itself quite good for raving.\n\nThe trip itself wasn't really fun though, not because of the 25E, but because I fucked up my set and setting. At one point my friend asked me if it was fine if \"he had sex with *our female friend*\". I told him I didn't really care because what else am I supposed to say. He told me I could join, but I refused, partly because I have a girlfriend, but even if I were single I'm still not sure I would've partaken, not my thing. This meant that I had to go sit in the common room with my computer and watch some netflix movies (even though I was invited to just watch as well, but I didn't really feel like watching 2 of my friends get it on together). This part sucked because I was tired, I felt drained, I felt quite alone due to the constant sexual tension in the room the entire trip and I was angry at myself because I knew I would be incredibly tired in Amsterdam. Also the common room was cold and the opposite of cozy. Also the movie was stupid (Mack and Devin go to high school, some good ol' stoner humor with Snoop Dogg I thought but turns out it's just a very boring movie).\n\nIn general: 25E-NBOH is very euphoric, with amazing visuals. Bodyload is bearable. It is very draining though so I'm not planning on doing it again if I don't have a proper bed to crash in (I fell asleep in the couch). I feel like it'd be fun to take at a rave because it felt quite energetic and euphoric.", "author": "pirateondrugs", "score": 20, "flair": null, "created": 1584135899.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/fhzuyh/25enboh_reagent_testing_and_trip_report/", "num_comments": 23, "title": "25E-NBOH: reagent testing and trip report", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fke9ely": {"score": 8, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/fhzuyh/25enboh_reagent_testing_and_trip_report/fke9ely/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1584137133.0, "body": "This is easily one of my top 3 substance now. It used to be lsd, thc, sass(mda). But 25e-nboh has taken 3rd by a long shot.

I dont get visuals on lsd. Unless I take upwards of 400ug and then I still don't get what everyone else gets around 150-200ug. For the longest it was very frustrating, always taking 3-5x the amount as everyone else and not getting any of the beautiful things everyones describing. I came to a peace with it about 4 years ago when I discovered the nitrous+lsd combo because then I can at least get a lil visuals for the 30 seconds to a min that nitrous provides. Also nothing better than the headspace Lucy gives.\n\nWhen I first tried 25e-nboh it was the first time I was blown away by visuals. I was litterally playing with air, i could see it coming out of my mouth like tiny little diamond particles and laying on my back I could blow towards the ceiling and watch it hit the ceiling similar to smoke and cascade and billow like waterfalls of tiny diamonds on the ceiling. The best part is! I didnt feel trippy at all, nor stimulated. Just completely sober with mindblowing visuals for the first time. It was so much fun it was unbelievable. \n\nNow about the roa, I love smoking this shit! We made a volumetric solution, took a few hits sublingually and smoked like 5 or 6 more each!

Drop a hit or two (depends on what the solution is dosed at) onto some foil, give it about 30 seconds- 1 min for the everclear to evaporate and you'll see a slight white coating where the everclear evaporated. Get yourself a straw or your choice of tooter, and smoke it like you would heroin or other similar substances youd chase on foil. The only thing is it evaporates almost instantly so you wanna have the straw near the residue to catch the vapor immediately, I hold every hit in as long as I can but ofcourse that's probably bad for you.\n\nSpeaking of which I don't know how safe any of this is yall!

I keep avoiding to even think about it, but I want to warn people of what Clonazolam can really do to a person. I was always the type of guy with an insane amount of self-control. I have tried 30 + mind altering substances and none of them lowered my inhibitions at all. Not even alcohol and Xanax. \n\n\nOr the two of them together. I never felt a single need to do something stupid, I\u2019d just be the same person as sober. I read a lot of bartard stories about Clonazolam, but I thought these people just had no self-control at all. I got warned not to get it. But three months ago I ordered a gram from a popular RC source, along with some Etizolam and 3-MMC. \n\n\nFor the first month I regularly used Etizolam (6-10mg a day). I live with my parents and grandparents and no one suspected a thing. In the month of June a lot of relatives came from abroad and we were having a huge family gathering at my father\u2019s side grandparents home (about 30 people). What makes this whole experience worse is that we are a very united, successful family and no one ever had a drug/alcohol/cigarettes problem. \n\n\nEveryone has high degrees. And here I am, a highschool dropout. As immature as it may sound, I found it (highscool) boring, so I quit. Anyway, I suffer from very bad social anxiety. One of the reason I take benzos. I can\u2019t even feel comfortable around my family members if I don\u2019t see them in a while. Mainly because a lot of relatives keep reminding me I\u2019m the only dropout in our family, I don\u2019t work and shit. \n\n\nSo I had the brilliant idea to take 2mg Clonazolam before going there. This is the first time I ever take Clonazolam. And this is the worst choice I\u2019ve ever made. I took it before driving my car, as I thought it should hit me around the time I arrive. It\u2019s a 20 minutes car ride to my grandparents\u2019 house and within 10 minutes I already feel it kick in. Any possible anxiety I could have instantly disappeared. By the time I got there I was already kinda fucked up. \n\n\nI struggled to coordinate my muscles and my speech was slightly slurred, but I managed to act normal at first. I was so happy I was around everyone with literally zero worry, like I belonged there with them. I always feel I don\u2019t belong around my family for being a dropout, but I go to each gathering because I get a lot of money, mainly from relatives from abroad. I can easily go back home with like 200\u20ac - 400\u20ac. I\u2019m pretty poor just so you know. I don\u2019t get more than 800\u20ac - 1200\u20ac to spend a year.\n\n\nWe start making endless BBQ, it\u2019s like a tradition we have at family gatherings. There\u2019s basically endless food, soda, and talking. Usually a lot of fun. It had the potential to be fun before I mean. It\u2019s never gonna be fun anymore. I was always hanging out with younger cousins which are 8-14 years old younger than me. We usually just do gaming on our phones. \n\n\nI never stay with the adults because again, my social anxiety is way too high. I\u2019m really socially awkward. And my cousins don\u2019t judge me either. We get along very well actually. I always get along well with younger kids, I think because I\u2019m immature myself. I\u2019m a gaming god and I always help them out on whatever games they play on their phones when we meet lol. At a point, it\u2019s eating time. We all get to a huge long table and start eating together. \n\n\nAfter sitting on my phone for nearly an hour with my cousins I didn\u2019t even notice how fucked up I was. The instant I get up from the bed I had to put a hand on the wall to support myself. I realized I could barely walk, but holy hell, that\u2019s the last thing I care about. On any other benzo I would find an escape out of this, but just go away or just anything. Because as I said, I don\u2019t get stupid on no substance and I still act the same. \n\n\nBut this is the first time in my life I don\u2019t give a shit. And man, it\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t give a flying fuck about anything, I was looking for trouble too. I was noticing everything, as I sat on the table I was contemplating on how everyone actually hates me and stares at me (the main reason for staring was because I was eating like a dog. I could barely use the knife and fork and was using mostly my hands to eat). I was thinking about how they consider me inferior to them and an anger was growing inside me. I didn\u2019t even know benzos can induce anger, every benzo I\u2019ve ever tried completely suppressed anger the way it did anxiety. This is the first drug I ever got anger induced on. \n\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t like pure anger when you\u2019re sober-anger, it was rather a blank-minded-anger, basically for the first time in my life I was bartarded. I just needed a trigger. And I got it. My aunt asked me to hand over the soda for her and once I only stretched out across the table to get it, I basically lost my balance and just fell on the table on some dishes. I don\u2019t even say anything and hand her the soda. And she tells me \u201c-insert my name here-, you don\u2019t look that good today!\u201d I instantly replied \u2018\u201cAnd you don\u2019t look good either you disproportionate whale.\u201d \n\n\nSo let me take a side note here and tell you something about myself. I\u2019m the most polite person you could ever imagine. My family, especially parents would sometimes make jokes because they never once heard me say a cuss word. I am and I always tried to be extremely respectful because this is the person I normally am. Now you can know the gravity about the things I said and did that day.\n\n\nAfter telling that to my aunt, everyone stopped eating and was basically in shock. My uncle (her husband) told me \u201cDo you think you have the permission to talk to my wife this way? What is wrong with you?\u201d And some other relative told to another \u201cI think he\u2019s drunk\u201d. I am not gonna get into more detail about  what happened after, but it was basically a continuous 2 minutes rant of me saying the most fucked up and offensive things to everyone trying to argue with me. Swear words themselves were nothing besides what I told that day. I offended everyone so much an uncle of mine tried to pick on a fight with me (my first ever fight also). From here on I can\u2019t remember every detail even tho I have an extremely good memory.\n\n\nBut what I was told is that I somehow broke a table in two trying to reach to my uncle who picked the fight up with me and it took 7 people to hold me. I\u2019m so happy they managed to contain me because I could\u2019ve seriously hurt someone in that state as I am a very strong dude and never used my strength upon anyone before. After they somehow calmed me down, I went directly into my car and took 10mg more Clonazolam. This is the worst my memory has ever been. \n\n\nIt\u2019s almost a complete blackout. After this redose I decided to stop taking revenge on people, but rather trash my grandparents\u2019 house instead. I feel so incredibly sorry I almost destroyed their entire living room because besides my parents, my grandparents were the only ones who I knew for sure had my support. I was told they forced me out of the house and when they threatened to call the cops I took off by my car.\n\n\nI was told I almost crawled to my car and anything I tried saying was unintelligible. What I will never understand is how I drove on AN ACTUAL road for about 2km without crashing, before making a turn on a country road leading to a forest and crashing my car in some bushes where I fell asleep in my car. My car had minimal damage because it rather got stuck there other than crashed. My grandparents live in a village and my dad found my car\u2019s location after tracking my phone\u2019s GPS. It was about 2pm when they found me. I was passed out there and they woke me up several times, but I never remember that. \n\n\nThey managed to take me off the car, and I basically passed out on the grass again. My parents, all four grandparents and two uncles of mine were there. They called in an ambulance because they were sure I got secretly drunk for the first time, drank too much and got into an alcohol coma. When the ambulance arrived, they couldn\u2019t get me contained again and the paramedics concluded I\u2019m most likely on drugs rather than drunk because if I was in an alcohol induced coma I wouldn\u2019t have this much strength left. \n\n\nThey recommended us to call the cops in order to get me safely contained but my relatives said they can deal with me. I was told I kept passing out on the road and tried to run away in the forest each time they tried to move me so after the paramedics concluded I wasn\u2019t overdosing my relatives just stayed there with me, shaking me every now and then to see me open my eyes so they be sure I wasn\u2019t dying. Only 8 hours later I was responsive enough to manage to walk and actually agree to go inside a car. \n\n\nMy parents drove me home. I sleep for another 8 hours and wake up in the morning with the thought if I should just hang myself instantly before even talking to my parents. The guilt and embarrassment were unimaginable. I just wanted to die. There was nothing else to say basically, I completely avoided talking to all my relatives ever since. \n\n\nMy parents told me to apologize to them, but I blocked them all on social media, their numbers and all and I\u2019m never gonna talk to them again because I\u2019m a coward. I had social anxiety being just sober around them, and now they expect me to talk to them after all this? I can\u2019t. I simply can\u2019t. My parents had to apologize for the embarrassment I am and everything I did. No one thought I was on drugs tho, but sure I got blackout drunk. \n\n\nEven after everything I did, they still think I\u2019m too much of a good \u201ckid\u201d to take any drugs. So that\u2019s Clonazolam, here you go, my Clonazolam experience report. I\u2019m not even gonna say don\u2019t try it, because I was the guy avoiding all warnings and was laughing at others\u2019 stories. \n\n\nGo ahead and try it, at your own risk. Sorry for the long post, I tried to make it as short as possible. I\u2019m more of a writer and I find a hard time saying things for short.

And uhh weird question anyone made a uhh propylene glycol solution??(if u know then u know what is in such a solution I don\u2019t wanna bring attention to it however anyone with my level of experience however had no choice but to use propylene glycol) well my local fucking vape shop still sells it but they found out what pure propylene glycol is used for outside a vape.... and I got called out but they said to the cashier not to mention anything just sell the propylene glycol cuz it\u2019s not their buisness nor are they doing anything wrong.... but after lots of \u201cno flavor or nicotine???\u201d Yes and nearly half a letter at a time it\u2019s kinda embarrassing going there now but fuck I\u2019m making them money at the end of the day selling something that in regular form to everyone else is useless but well they researched why I was buying it cuz they clearly said it\u2019s used to make drugs but they aren\u2019t at fault and they actually like selling it without nicotine or flavor it\u2019s huge profit when they buy huge ass jugs at a time for dirt ass cheap.

Yea man I\u2019m good... well 5 min later comes the female omg he just crashed right there... I\u2019m PANICKING CUZ OF HIS PERSONALITY DUDE WOULD SNITCH ON HIS MOM FATHER BROTHER SISTER OR KIDS NOT BUILD LIKE ME OR DID HE UNDERSTAND WHAT I DO AO IM LIKE WONDERFUL CUZ THEY HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT HES INTOXICATED ON AND THEN THEY WILL BE LOOKING FOR MY ASS. So thru some miracle he didn\u2019t have cops called came back and I was like don\u2019t tell anyone wtf u got if asked u say Xanax and u don\u2019t know me. Last time I spoke to him cuz if cops came holy shiy no piss test necessary he would have read like a rabbi from a giant scroll aka the Torah in a lavish form like the original Quran written in circles that\u2019s amazing more then any scroll is... but Torah is basically Old Testament and if u don\u2019t believe there\u2019s facts in the Old Testament u either never read it or don\u2019t know history or don\u2019t know how the fuck some old ass people without electricity had knowledge that sound can be a weapon unless they really fucking broke the walls of Jericho with a sound weapon(google LRAD supposedly its intense and disabling and all by sound waves originally to make helicopters crash now it\u2019s for use in America for riot control) how could they make a story like that without knowing sounds capabilities??? Also Noah\u2019s arc check found in the 70s and no one fucking knows anything it\u2019s exactly where the Bible says the wood is now petrified but metallic locks and bolts were found said to be unable to be dated(typically bullshyt) then the area immediately became military only zone mt Ararat in turkey if u see where the boat is u will know why every continent has a flood story was there animals on board absolutely NOT let\u2019s be realistic if he knew a flood was coming and built something able to withstand the force of that flood hitting DNA not animals would be most logical but this backs the dramatic evidence there\u2019s been more advanced civilizations then we are today and they may still exist.... but apparently we\u2019re too primative and violent for a advanced species of humans to develop supposedly the good aliens all left cuz us asking for technology instead of protection from other entities that were \u201con their way\u201d but asking for technology made them determine clearly that\u2019s asking for what will be used in war or as a weapon so they said were not going to advance we\u2019re gonna kill each other till everyone is the same color and beliefs basically we\u2019re gonna do what was threatened to us if a nuke is ever dropped again and that\u2019s returning to the Stone Age starting over entirely. What\u2019s failed to be mentioned is spirituality was the only form of religion till shit got unexplainable and well a human on a horse fooled montizuma so imagine one who flys yet u never seen a wheel. That\u2019s when godly religions took over and Rome seperated spirituality from religion intentionally so they only knew the spiritual side but Vatican and tarot cards preach the pineal gland aka third eye like crazy(pine cones are symbolic for the pineal aka third eye but fluoride supposedly calcifies it aka DMT cannot be released easily aka ur psychic and spiritual abilities and chances of experiencing anything spiritual is dramatically decreased.... maybe DMT is what I need to figure out why my grandfather sent a war buddy to talk to me instead of immediately talking why me?? Why no street drugs I\u2019m worried he\u2019s trying to say my life is gonna be like his. Basque Spaniard all family killed and after Hitler helped he had to flee to Africa which somehow he did and alive then decided to walk over to Egypt where he happily helped the UK in WWII cuz hitler interfered and Basque people can be soldiers who don\u2019t need training or they just wanna love and live in peace... and keep preserving a language and culture Stalin and communist helped not the Spaniard communists but the Basque if u wanna crazy piece of history ALL SHOULD KNOW OF find out about the Basque people and Bilbao...  we invented the cross that Celtic people adopted(Iberian Celtics were the closest to live by us in the past so must have been VERY friendly the UK Celtic people LEFT IBERIA ON BOAT AND THATS HOW THEY BECAME A TOTALLY UNRECOGNIZABLE FORM OF CELTICS but that cross with a circle is possibly the oldest and original cross ever found cuz(star of David and the cross are WAY older then any Abrahamic religion they just stole it and no Jesus wasn\u2019t crucified on a cross a Roman crucifix is a Y shape ALWAYS and if u read the Gnostics gospels(never supposed to be found again Constantine wiped out and demonized everyone except Christianity although he faked converting and remained a Roman pagan in practice it wasn\u2019t a secret the book of Eli is kinda a history lesson cuz Constantines New Testament is clearly a edited bunch of bull first off if someone starts every sentence off with lord I believe they are insane but Old Testament would shock u that Noah\u2019s arc of all things was found in the 70s exactly where bible says after metallic locks and bolts found turkey kicked everyone out and made it a military zone aka authorized to killl u if u walk there. But a satellite image will show the remains of the boat but the woods now petrified.

But there\u2019s first documented use of sound as a weapon which I didn\u2019t fucking know was real till LRAD was used in riots and supposedly\nTLDR: looking for a good stimulant preferably similar to mephedrone also how is FDCK or the ket alternative my Asian friends used ket in bumps as if coke and seemed to love it at low doses... also what\u2019s the best current benzo(6mg of klonopin a day means it cannot be weak like Valium which is trash to me) my damn closest vape shop called me out about why I was buying propylene glycol and they apparently make a lot selling no flavors or nicotine cuz they pay practically nothing so me buying it is apparently very curious to the woman the man said exactly what it\u2019s other use is and said we cannot get in trouble for anything someone does after purchasing it. And they cannot and will not say no cuz I could have my own damn way of making vape liquids but hell Na I just quit smoking cigarettes and only vape nicotine salt cuz I\u2019ve gotten too much nicotine from normal vapes one night I didn\u2019t sleep at fucking all that\u2019s not a healthy amount of nicotine with those effects I know with nicotine salt I cartrage is less then a pack of Newport\u2019s. So no I won\u2019t vape their nicotine cuz u cannot monitor and control the nicotine intake. Stupid tobacco didn\u2019t exactly stop anything instead I found an old Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e 2 pack and holy shit what\u2019s in juul besides nicotine flavor and propylene glycol cuz even that was thick and my blueberry I know is just minimal flavor nicotine and propylene glycol cuz it\u2019s almost clear and isn\u2019t like syrup or for other juul pod flavors like tobacco it\u2019s molasses wtf I\u2019m glad they banned them cuz definitely getting healthier ones now and half price.

I would like to know people's opinions on the various RC benzos they've tried and which pharm benzo they are most like. You don't have to stick to just one pharm in instances where you think it's a cross or a mix between multiple pharm benzos. Also (and especially in the cases of a mix), adding a line following the part where you compare the RC to the pharm with a few descriptive words about which parts of each match is helpful. You could also just use the following line to list off some descriptive adjuctives about the RC but I would say the following lines are optional\n\nHere are two examples that could be used as format per se:\n\nFlualprazolam - Xanax/alprazolam. Exactly 2x as potent but feels almost exactly the same as regular xanax but maybe with a bit more sedation\n\nEtizolam - Xanax/alprazolam, Klonopin/clonazepam, and Ativan/Lorazepam. Has the same clarit and lower potency on klons and ativan, the same anxiolysis as xanax, and the lower sedation levels of ativan\n\nPps, feel free to compare them to the less common benzos if needed if you think the fit is right. Especially so if it lowers the number of pharm benzos used in the comparison. I was trying to think of an example and an RC benzo that would work as an example but it's been so long since I tried any of the more rare pharm benzos (and was back when I was much less experienced with benzos in general) that I just couldn't think of one.\n\nI ask this of yall because I've wanted to put together a guide of sorts for RC benzos for people familiar with pharm benzos but don't have the means or need (I'm stocked for... years probably) to order any of the more novel RC benzos\n\nAnd one off topic question that for reason reason always pops into my mind while writing posts that can be ignored unless you know the answer: is phenazepam still around these days or just way harder to find than it used to be?

Their are those rare types of ppl that have to try everything once.  Today is Clonazolam, next week is DXM, a week after that they will try chasing the dragon.  But if i was a gambling man i would guess that either they already have a benzo dependency or they binge benzos like a blackout drinker.  I personally have been both.  In 2009 i lived at a halfway house that allowed benzos.  I was a heroin addict and talked a dr into prescribing me ativan.  I then developed a bar habit.  I eventually kicked and swore id never get dependent on benzos again.  So until about a year ago i binged bars at most once every 2 weeks or so .  i mostly binged every time i bought a Kpack or 2 to insure my customers couldn't say they were fake.  To make a long story short i got set up, went to prison, lost everything.  After over 10 years of no dependency i became homeless and started developing a tolerance again.  It made it easier to sleep outside or on subways.     Once i got an apt. I made it a quest to try every RC benzo available.   I found that fluaprazolam and Clonazolam were my favorite.  I regularly get prescription Xanax but they give me a horrible sweet tooth.  To the point i started looking like i smoke crack or do meth or something.   For some reason the RC's dont give me a sweetooth like alp.  If you have a history with benzos i highly suggest eating 1 pellet.  If your at all worried have a loved one or good friend babysit you so you dont do anything crazy.   If you have no history with benzos then def break the pellet in half.  (The pellets i buy are more like flying saucers and easily can be broken in half by hand.  If you need to break into 1/4 buy a pill splitter from Walgreens. My commute is over.

It cant be put to word very well. and for me worse! :D2fdck is very much like ketamine wonky and fun. u will not understand that until u experience it either. this is more like weed than 3mmc but still very different from weed high. VERY different and more potent. But you may kinda understand that once u do it. I did!I would personally do the 3mmc first by itself and then go to the 2fdck. when the 3mmc starts to wear off u will feel... bad. it is called coming down. U are feeling normal but u were just so high in the clouds it feels bad to go back down. 2f now will help that. u feel okay again and can enjoy the wonky space even more! If u want to experience them on their own that is okay too. Even a 24hrs apart should not be too bad. Maybe a couple if u are worried.Also if u have bad anxiety/depresion I would say be careful with 3mmc.I have not done any synthetic weed stuff so I do not know how those make u feel. I would say you will enjoy both these very much. Remeber to eat, drink water, and get good rest each night. Especially on the 3mmc! u wont wanna eat so having some fruit or something nice and easy to snack on will help. oh and magnesium will help if u get a headache or jaw tight \"chewing teeth\" if u smoke cigs I would high recommend smoking on both of these (weed too) come back and say how it was!  \nEDIT: I saw 6abp posted and it is better than 3mmc.

I'd suggest stopping there as far as RC's though. I've been on every RC benzo and pharma benzo in existence, literally. Once you get into the Flubro, Clam or flualp territory it's pretty much game over for anything else. Another safe(ish) RC if you like the skeletal/muscle relaxant benzos would be 100%, Diclazepam. It's basically Valium times 10. Just my experience, lasts a long time and great for tapers, it's just not really around in pure or quality these days after it was banned alot of places. There's a diclaz analogue people try selling as diclaz more often than not which is a ton weaker. But etizolam is definitely one of the more forgiving things you could be taking. It's weaker than kpins, xanax, etc etc 1:1. So if that works, stick to that my man. But hopefully you're taking it for anxiety and not purely to get a high otherwise you'll likely end up trying stronger RC's, lke i did.

I recall extreme euphoria and horniness. **In terms of my subjective effects, BDO is like if GHB took too much Xanax.**\n\n**Additionally, I am not an expert and I'd appreciate input into any of my thoughts.**\n\nSo, a few months ago I began to experiment with BDO. At first I got a contaminated batch that caused scary side effects (weird nerve pain and absurd nausea, no euphoria). I was able to get a clean source.\n\nFor reference: I'm female, 5'7, 115lbs, I have no pre-existing health conditions, I suffer from ADHD, mild Aspergers. I ensure that I have an empty stomach and no alcohol in my system. **For harm reduction purposes, I take Zofran with my first dose in the event something goes wrong.**\n\n**BDO**\n\n* I find my ideal dose to be between 1.2-1.5mg, and re-dosing every 2-2.5 hours. I generally start with 1.5, then redose at 1.2. I absolutely can't go above 1.5mg, or I'll pass out. I stir it into an 8oz can of Key Lime La Croix, although it's tasteless even in water. I like the Pavlovian response I have to the flavour of that beverage now.I had to do some experimentation to get this right. This dose has held true to almost everyone I've shared it with, although some people have had absolutely no response, although it's unclear whether they've been honest about their stomach contents or prior alcohol consumption. Nobody overdosed however, just felt nothing.  **When I was still getting the dosing/redosing right, if I took too much (a hair over the therapeutic window!)  and fell asleep, I awoke with extreme nausea, double vision, malaise, poor mental acuity, tingling in ankles.**\n* The effects are unpredictable with consistent dosing/spacing of redosing, even though I always dose on empty stomach/no alcohol. Sometimes, I'm able to get a moderate amount of euphoria. Other times, very little. Sometime it's entactogenic, other times very little occurs. Sometimes it's sedating, sometimes it's a bit stimulating. Slight nausea and double vision are frequent occurrences. Music enhancement is a predictable effect for me, and the primary reason why I use it. I find no point in doing it without music. It lacks the sexual component of GHB. Onset for me is around 10 min, it's fairly subtle, so I find it to peak shortly after, last for around 1-1.5 hours, then there's a fuzzy-headed, languid after effect.\n* I'll have times where I binge on it about 5x a night, several nights in a row. No withdrawal symptoms are experienced.\n\n**GHB**\n\n* (Again, empty stomach, no alcohol) My solution is 0.5g/ml, but for simplification, I'll speak about my dose in grams. We'd dose in water and chase with ginger beer. It has a salty, slightly soapy taste, not unpleasant.I have found my dose to be 3g, which seems unusually high, but I feel stimulated, euphoric, no double vision or nausea, even more intense music enhancement, much more sexual. It took me 45min for it to come up, and the active effects lasted 3 hours! I slowly came down, no hangover. My friend (age 46, 5'11, 160lbs) and I took 1.5g the first time, and felt absolutely nothing. I was afraid of the dose-response curve, so he took 2g and I observed and asked about his experience. Come up started at T+15, peak effects reached at T+30, he found it to be the most euphoric drug he's ever taken (extensively experienced), no nausea, he felt very sexual, etc. This lasted 2 hours! Longer than BDO.He felt great, but I believe 2g was toeing the line as he'd nod off sometimes.\n* He redosed too much too soon (2g three hours after his first dose, it seems obvious now that redoses MUST be smaller) and had nausea, ataxia, agitation, confusion. It was extremely difficult to get him into the recovery position, but he didn't vomit (likely the nausea) and slept for around an hour, awoke feeling alright. Very scary to witness.\n* Another day, 1.75g was just as euphoric for him as 2g, but stimulating. I took 2g and experienced absolutely nothing. Waited the appropriate time to return to baseline, tried 2.25, then 2.5, 2.75, and finally at 3g I experienced what my friend did at 1.75g. I have to wonder why there is such a discrepancy for us dosage wise. Start around 1g when trying out! Apparently most people crash anywhere above 2g, not sure why I needed such a high dose. The 1.75g and 3g doses have been consistent for us in effect.\n\n**TL:DR:** BDO has more consistent dosing but less predictable effects, GHB has far more variable individual dosages but predictable effects (euphoria, sensory enhancement, etc). No nausea or double vision.

Anything that makes you trip (weed, ergolines, tryptamines, etc) with the exception of dissos will have the chance of causing anxiety via the 5HT2 serotonin receptors. These receptors in our brain, when activated, cause hallucinations as well as a sympathetic response. Sympathetic means adrenaline, fight or flight, energy. Think uppers.

Cheers!\nEdit: to piggy back off of the response above me, what I mean with marijuana is that in some people, our unique chemistry causes marijuana to activate more downer receptors than upper receptors resulting in anxiolytic effects. In others chemical makeup, it has an affinity for serotonergic receptors.

Also, just a friendly reminder that if you ever go to the hospital for a cocaine OD or stim OD, they pump you full of valium (the parent compound of xanax), so its not only ok to mix the two, its probably safer for your body (less vasoconstriction, anxiety, heart rate).

Clonazolam I have had many experiences with, both good and bad. being older now I have a lot of self-discipline and I understand the concept \"You can always take more, but you can never take less\". When my order came I decided to only take a total of two drops to test its anti-anxiety effects. at 1 drop I felt my anxiety melt away however in comparison to other benzos I felt slightly cloudy headed, but not in a bad way. I felt this one drop was okay with my system after 4 hours so I took one more and boy what can I say this is truly a Xanax and Klonopin baby. The effects are really enjoyable, it doesn't interfere with my nightly game of Red Dead Redemption, and there is zero anxiety present as if it never existed. these results have come about because I have learned how to not compulsively redose. Although I prefer Pyrazolam for its anti-anxiety effects that surpass others, Clonazolam has a unique euphoria I notice from it. I recommend this substance. Just remember to be considerate of your drops and do your best to remain a low tolerance to enjoy fully.\n\nFuture chems I am reviewing are Etizolam solution and Bromazolam solution .

This is when I bought 20 more Farmaprams. BIG mistake. I took a shit ton of them to relax after a stressful day at work, took some etiz, smoked weed, drank a few beers, and also took these mexican muscle relaxers (soma 5mg) maybe 15mg total and it FUCKED me up.

Although these z drugs seem to be quite unusual. Firstly they don't knock me out in the same way as benzos. I get kind of a fuzzy mind, I guess this is the  hypnotic aspect. And eventually I drift off. What concerns me is the stories I've heard of very real and scary hallucinations. Particularly at the tail end of stim binges. The chance of this seems to increase with dose.\n\nI had a stupid moment when drunk a while ago where I took 50mg valium and 15mg zopiclone. This was not the intention, I meant to just take 20mg valium but my memory stops there. Apparently I was a complete liability. Bashing into shit, shouting. I.e not sleeping as I would expect.\n\nI think the zopiclone might have made me sleep walk.\n\nAnyone got experience of killing comedowns with benzos or zopiclone?", "author": "critical_think_key", "score": 8, "flair": null, "created": 1590356169.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/gppsc0/benzos_or_zopiclone_z_drugs_for_stim_comedown/", "num_comments": 12, "title": "Benzos or Zopiclone (z drugs) for stim comedown", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"frnv84o": {"score": 7, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gppsc0/benzos_or_zopiclone_z_drugs_for_stim_comedown/frnv84o/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1590356728.0, "body": "Rebound insomnia will probably be worse with zopiclone....it is in my experience.

Recently I was gifted like a years supply of 300mg gabapentin and small amount of a few other things (methocarbamol, carisoprodol, buprenorphine) so I've been using those since I ran out of kratom. Right now I'm using belbuca (0.3mg/300mcg of buprenorphine) and even that was strong enough to feel pretty good for me on days 1-2, currently tapering down before I run out of it. \n\n\nBackground TLDR: \n\nLong-term high weed tolerance with recent sensitivity to high THC. 1 year kratom use with low opiate tolerance, no experience with benzos/dissociatives/psychs/stims other than caffeine (coffee/energy drinks in excess). Recent divorce, mainly self-medicating for depression/anxiety but I've found I really enjoy a nice nod as well. \n\n\nI'm planning to order:\n\n-ODSMT (O-desmethyltramadol)\n\n-2map (2-methyl AP-237)\n\n-Tianeptine\n\n-2F-viminol\n\n-Etizolam\n\n\n\nOrdering (no sourcing):\n\nIt appears I can order all of these in low quantities from various clearnet websites. Should I expect any issues with that? Etizolam for example appears to be available in pill bottles like a legal otc product. I'm assuming price wise I'm probably getting ripped off but I just want to place a simple quick order without spending over $50-$100 (per RC) for now to see if they even work for me. That should be fine, right? \n\n\nAdditions:\n\nKetamine has always sounded interesting & I saw some posts about dck/2-fdck, I need to do more research first but does that seem like it belongs on my list? Or any other varieties of etizolam in addition to or instead of it? Is there a mellow psych readily available that I need to at least try?\n\n\nPreparations:\n\nI know I need to get a mg scale for some of these more than likely to dose correctly & safely.  Probably some smaller capsules too? I have 000 caps for kratom but they can fit almost 1g. Any specific reagent testing kit recommended? I can research that more on my own once I know what I'm buying though I guess. \n\n\nWarnings:\n\nI've already heard horror stories with tianeptine so I'm gonna be extra careful with that. & I think I understand to be careful with etizolam and treat it like I've heard about Xanax (taper down, can cause seizures, minimize mixing with alcohol, etc). Anything else to watch out for here? I tend to mix lots of things in low amounts like: kratom/opiod + coffee/energy drink + weed/cbd with a bit of tobacco & then in the evening the same combo with alcohol instead of the coffee/energy drink. Lately gabapentin (1-2gs over time) has been added to the mix. Do you foresee any dangerous combos between those and my list?\n\nIf you read all this I really appreciate it, I tried breaking it into sections to make it more readable. Hopefully this post is allowed, I looked through the rules & FAQs quite a bit but didn't see anything prohibiting this as far as I could tell. \n\nThanks.\n\nEdit: Sorry for all the weird spacing, I guess I don't know how to line break or make lists correctly on Reddit so I used extra spaces to break it up as best I could.", "author": "throwaway54683728", "score": 2, "flair": null, "created": 1582002074.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/f5flbz/how_does_my_list_look_for_first_time_trying_rcs/", "num_comments": 11, "title": "How does my list look for first time trying rcs ever?

It's more that I don't have any reason not to experiment anymore, went from trying to cut back on weed & occasional drinking to get ready to start a family to not having any family at all and drinking everyday. At this point I've very much been a \"without drugs I would've already ended it a while ago\" person for a while now similar to what you see over in /r/opiates.

Like K-Pins have shitty hell withdrawal symptoms on their own, but it onsets gradually because of its wonderfully long half life.

It's weird cause I'll be fine all day until late afternoon the day following previous day's dose and all of a sudden I develope a horrific headache, pressure build up behind my eyes and neck just below my ears, feel like I'm going to die, have a panic attack that lasts for hours, and it just comes on wreaking havoc like a bartard bull in a china shop.\n\nAnyone have a similar experience with this?
