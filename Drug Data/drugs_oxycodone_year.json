{"g1bpgh": {"text": "*Disclaimer: This post is very long and highly subjective but perhaps helpful or at least interesting to some. Most of the following substances and combinations were tested by me and/or close friends, but some of them are purely based on anecdotal evidence gathered from different reports on various subreddits and websites.*\n\n**WARNING: Many people might disagree with my list and I strongly discourage trying some of the listed substances and/or combinations, as some of them carry a serious risk of addiction/dependence and/or are hazardous to your health. Some of the listed substances are considered \"research chemicals\" and have not been studied at all. Furthermore and most importantly, some of the listed drugs/combinations may even be fatal when taken in high doses so please be responsible! Please beware of the risks, do your own research and evaluate carefully, if you still want to try some of my suggestions. Stay safe!**\n\nAs there's dozens of posts on Reddit every month asking what drug is best for (...) purpose, I figured I want to create a list with the 5 drugs or drug combinations that are best or more accurately most effective/efficient for the most commonly asked purposes and reliably produce these effects.\n\nIn my opinion, the following psychotropic drugs (+combinations) are best for (...) and I will briefly explain why:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*(listed in no particular order)*\n\n##tripping for psychedelic veterans / deep mind-exploration:\n\n**LSD / 1cP-LSD**: I don't think I have to really explain why LSD is on this list. An 8-12 hour trip which can be extremely intense and ego-shattering in high doses. Very beautiful visuals, an analytical but very deep headspace and the potential for strong spiritual and religious revelations.\n\n**Psilocybin mushrooms / 4-AcO-DMT**: Oh the good ol' mushrooms. High dose mushroom trips had me fucked up and trapped in my head like no other drug and taught me more than most substances. Psilocybin can be very confusing with its weird headspace, but the beautiful, organic OEVs and the connectedness to mother earth are absolutely stunning and make it a 'must' on this list.\n\n**5-MeO-DMT**: I have not tried 5-MeO-DMT personally because honestly, I'm a little scared, but my friends that tried it said that it was more intense than regular DMT and that it probably is the most intense psychedelic known to date. Witnessing nothing and everything was never closer together. A white pit of emptiness and complete ego-loss. Recommended for experienced psychonauts only.\n\n**DMT**: I think DMT is the most unique and the most breathtaking substance I've ever consumed. It has without a doubt the most beautiful and the most intense CEVs out of any drug. If you take a high enough dose you experience the so-called 'breakthrough', an incredibly intense and possibly life-changing experience with (possible) entities, machine-elves and other weird presences.\n\n**DPT**: Its able to completely eradicate every sense of reality and fucks with your mind like only a handful of substances can. It presents a sinister and eerie vibe for some and a lot of people don't really enjoy the compound. Nevertheless, DPT is very mind-bending and should be treated with utter respect. It definitely deserves a spot in the category 'most intense psychedelics'.\n\n...all of the listed substances can be combined to achieve stronger effects, but I advise starting with a lower dose than you usually take as combining psychedelics is highly synergistic! Be careful.\n\n**honorable mentions**: 2C-E or 2C-P / DOB or DOM (these 4 substances have a really long duration, stimulation, very strong bodyloads, crazy visuals and are able to induce very strong synaesthesia! Imo the novel psychedelic phenethylamines/amphetamines are absolutely amazing and underrated!)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##tripping for noobies / beginner-friendly hallucinogens:\n\n**Cannabis Edibles** (atypical psychedelic): Cannabis edibles can be very psychedelic and are able to induce visuals, a strong euphoria and a very unique headspace (which feels different to the headspace of smoked Cannabis). I suggest starting with a low-dose and working your way up as Cannabis edibles are notorious for being underestimated and then surprising the user with uncomfortably strong effects.\n\n**2C-B / Mescaline HCl [low-dose]** (psychedelic): 2C-B is one of my favorite psychedelics, because it's so versatile and easy-going. It's amazing for tripping with friends, listening to music, having sex and also partying (in low-doses). It has a very manageable headspace, beautiful visuals, a short duration and can become pretty euphoric! It feels like a light-version of Mescaline, which can be a very good beginners psychedelic as well, but due to it being very rare in HCl/Sulphate form this doesn't seem like a realistic/viable choice as preparing a mescaline-containing cactus takes time/practice, induces quite a bit of nausea and is unpredictable in its effects because its hard to properly dose.\n\n**AL-LAD / LSD [low-dose]** (psychedelic): AL-LAD is getting rarer day by day, but if you get the chance to try it then I would! Its like a shorter-lasting (~8-9 hours), more visual, less confusing and overall more recreational acid. Good as a starter psychedelic and to get a feel for LSD. Don't worry, if you can't find AL-LAD, because LSD can be a very good beginners psychedelic as well in light to medium doses (~75-100ug). Lysergamides are a great option for tripping outside in summer, because of their long duration, great color-enhancement and potentially euphoric effects. They positively enhance music and can be very recreational, if you don't take too high of a dose.\n\n**4-HO-MET / Psilocybin mushrooms [low-dose]** (psychedelic): 4-HO-MET is a pretty popular research chemical of the tryptamine family and is closely related to Psilocybin (magic mushrooms). They share many similarities, but 4-HO-MET is considered to be a gentler, less confusing, more visual and more recreational substance compared to mushrooms (similar to AL-LAD with LSD and 2C-B with Mescaline). It's cheap, readily available online and legal in many countries. If you have mushrooms then I suggest starting with a 1-2.5g dose for medium effects in strength. Just ride the mushroom wave and don't fight their effects, they are amazing little fuckers. ;)\n\n**Ketamine / 2-FDCK** (dissociative): Now listen, I know Ketamine is not considered to be a psychedelic so tripping may not be the right word (getting wonky might be more fitting), but it's a dissociative which is considered to be a hallucinogen. Ketamine can get pretty weird real quick but its generally not as anxiety-inducing as psychedelics, because it also has numbing/tranquilizing effects. Ketamine's effects only last for a very short period of time, so if you get overwhelmed its not really a big deal because half an hour later the effects will be significantly diminished. 2-FDCK is like a less potent, often cheaper, less sedating version of ketamine and also legal in many countries. I prefer regular Ket over 2F-Ketamine, but if you can't get ketamine for some reason 2-FDCK might be for you.\n\n**honorable mentions**: MDA or 6-APB (two long-lasting entactogens with hallucinogenic properties. They are not really considerered psychedelics, but still are good starter drugs as \"rolls\u201c are easier to control than most trips)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##social-setting / partying:\n\n**Alcohol + Cocaine**: Alcohol plus Cocaine is one of the most popular drug combinations around the world and rightfully so. Both substances somehow enhance and cancel out their effects at the same time and create a pleasurable, euphoric and talkative high. Unfortunately, this combination is very dangerous and should be avoided on a regular basis. When both drugs are taken together they create the toxic substance Cocaethylene in your liver, which is way more harmful than each substance individually. Not to mention the addiction potential of either substance. Be careful and take long breaks!\n\n**Alcohol + Amphetamine**: Also a very pleasurable combination! Stimulants usually reduce the intoxicating and depressant effects of ethanol which leads to more drinking and can lead to a delayed alcohol poisoning once the amphetamine wears off (The risk is even higher with Alcohol + Cocaine, because Cocaine has a much shorter duration than Speed). Alcohol sort of takes the edge off a stimulant which makes this a great combination, BUT the comedown/hangover is absolutely horrendous.\n\n**Amphetamine + MDMA** (+Alcohol): This combination is pretty popular in the rave scene even though amphetamine slightly diminishes the effects of MDMA when taken at the same time in my experience. Some people feel too out of it and don't experience enough energy on MDMA alone, that's why this combination is so established in Europe, as it keeps you going for the whole night. I strongly advise against combining these two substances as amphetamine increases MDMAs neurotoxicity and its an enormous strain on the heart, especially in high doses. The comedown is dreadful.\n\n**4-FA / 4-FMA** (+Alcohol): These two fluorinated amphetamines are the most recreational and the most enjoyable out of the bunch imo. They are pretty similar, but most people I know (that have tried both) and myself included prefer 4-FA, but its not readily available atm. 4-FA feels like a lighter version of MDMA for 2-3 hours and then transitions over into classic amphetamine-like stimulation for another 4-5 hours. Its doesn't produce a remarkable hangover and has relatively few noticeable side-effects compared to 4-FMA, which feels a little dirtier but definitely stronger on the stimulatory and empathogenic effects. Both substances are research chemicals with only little history of human use and I recommend doing a lot of individual research before consuming them.\n\n**3-MMC / 4-MMC** (+Alcohol): 3-MMC (Metaphedrone) and the more popular 4-MMC (Mephedrone) are empathogens of the cathinone family and they produce highly euphoric effects. Both substances are pretty fiendish and can lead to many \"unplanned\" redoses, because I and many people don't experience a ceiling-effect (like with MDMA), which means you experience similar effects in intensity with each redose. 3-MMC feels more dopaminergic and more stimulating, while 4-MMC feels more heavy on serotonin, thus inducing more entactogenic and more MDMA-like effects. I find 4-MMC to be superior to 3-MMC, but both substances are worth trying out if you have enough will-power.\n\n**honorable mentions**: 2C-B [low-dosed] + Alcohol / Ketamine [low-dosed] / 5-APB or 6-APB / GHB or GBL / Alcohol \n\n&nbsp;\n\n##non social-setting / relaxing / alone-time:\n\n**Alcohol**: A beer after work is great, nuff said.\n\n**Cannabis**: A joint after work for winding down is also great, nuff said.\n\n**Dissociatives** (Ketamine / DCK / MXE / etc.): Dissociatives are a very unique class of drugs and can produce extraordinary experiences (e.g. holes) that are best experienced alone in bed with your favorite music playing. They are not for everyone and can lead to bad habits, but a k-hole is an experience which is so utterly bizarre and fascinating that I think they deserve a spot on this list. Dissos are also amazing for watching movies/videos and creating an immersive and exciting experience for the user. Use sparingly!\n\n**Benzodiazepines** (Diazepam (Valium) / Triazolam (Halcion) / etc.) **\\[low-dosed\\] + Alcohol \\[low-dosed\\]**: Probably one of the most controversial combinations on here because it's well-known that alcohol and benzodiazepines in combination can lead to respiratory depression and possibly death, but taking low-doses of each substance doesn\u2019t pose a serious risk and is very euphoric and peaceful. A little .125mg Halcion with a glass of red-wine and a puff of weed is seriously underrated and also deserves a spot on here. Don\u2019t go overboard with this combination and be responsible! \n\n**Opioids** (Dihydrocodeine (Paracodin) / Hydrocodone (Vicodin) / etc.): Fucking with opioids is always a gamble because of their addiction potential and that's the reason why I stay off them, but to probably nobody's surprise they feel great. Perfect mix of sedation, euphoria, anxiety-relief, pain-relief etc. and are just optimal for relaxing at home. If you decide to try them regardless, I suggest sticking to lighter opioids like Kratom, Codeine, Dihydrocodeine, Tramadol and use very sparingly.\n\n**honorable mentions**: Muscle relaxants (Carisoprodol (Soma), etc.) + Opioids / Antihistamines (Promethazine, DPH, etc.) + Opioids / Benzodiazepines [low-dosed] + Opioids [low-dosed] / Barbiturates\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##pure pleasure / hedonism:\n\n**Cocaine [IV or smoked]**: Users report that when cocaine is IV\u2019d it creates a bell-ringing noise in one\u2019s ear followed by an extremely intense euphoria far stronger and not even comparable to that of insufflated cocaine. Smoked crack cocaine is also insanely euphoric, but a very short-lived and fiendish high, which often leads to compulsive redosing. Using cocaine IV or smoking crack is highly addictive and I dont advise doing so. Binging on cocaine can easily lead to stimulant psychosis so beware!\n\n**Methamphetamine \\[IV or smoked\\]**: I have never smoked or injected methamphetamine let alone tried it, but judging from people's experience it must be one of the most intense and euphoric highs achievable. I'd stay clear, especially if you like stimulants. If you decide to use it regardless then stick to using it orally, its way less fiendish and you don't experience that notorious meth rush which users like so much. Binging on methamphetamine can easily lead to stimulant psychosis so beware!\n\n**Pyrovalerones (a-PVP / a-PHP / MDPV / etc.) [vaporized]**: Pyrovalerones are potent stimulants which induce extremely powerful euphoria and are notoriously fiendish when vaporized (similar to methamphetamine, but shorter lasting and reported to be even more addictive.) I have no personal experience with them, because imo they are high-risk substances and most of them have a short history of human use. If you still want to try a pyrovalerone please be very careful and use sparingly, if that\u2019s even possible. Binging on pyros can easily lead to stimulant psychosis so beware!\n\n**Heroin \\[IV\\]**: I've never IV'd Heroin and probably never will because the risks outweigh the benefits. A Heroin nod is one of the strangest things to look at, but apparently its a state of extreme bliss and contentment. You're floating on a cloud where nothing is bothering you and you don't care about anything. It's heaven and hell at the same time. A nod is weirdly psychedelic (similar to hypnagogia) and its like falling in and out of a really euphoric dream. Beware of Fentanyl or other potent cutting agents, always start with a low dose and have your drugs tested if that's possible. Always keep Naloxone (Narcan) on you!\n\n**Oxymorphone (Opana) \\[IV\\]**: Opana is arguably the most pleasurable painkiller available in the US and probably the most addictive. Oxymorphone to Oxycodone is like 5-MAPB to MDMA, so more sedating, more euphoric and longer-lasting. I've never tried it personally and it's pretty much non-existent in Europe, but don't let big pharma fool you Oxymorphone is just as pleasurable and addictive as Diacetylmorphine (Heroin), which btw is also prescribed in a few countries. Please be careful and don't use this compound, if you don't already have an opioid-tolerance. As little as 3-5mg (intranasally) can seriously mess an opioid-naive person up. Always keep Naloxone (Narcan) on you!\n\n...Speedballing (mixing a stimulant with an opioid) is arguably more enjoyable and more pleasurable for most users than either substance individually. I strongly advise against mixing uppers with downers because of an increased overdose risk and an increased strain on your circulatory system! Stay safe!\n\n**honorable mentions**: 4-FMA [IV] / 4-MMC [intranasal] / 5-MAPB [intranasal] / MDMA + Nitrous Oxide\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##sex:\n\n**WARNING: All of the following drugs are imo even more pleasurable when mixed with GHB/GBL. They are vasodilators and make you horny as fuck, but this poses a serious threat to one's health and can easily lead to overdoses, because GHB and GBL are very dose-sensitive and compulsive. Dont redose before 2 hours have passed and stick to low doses! Please, only use GHB/GBL if you have done your research and never mix them with other depressants as this easily leads to an OD. GHB and GBL are also physically addictive, so use sparingly. Stay safe.**\n\n**3-MMC / 4-MMC + GHB**: Cathinones make you a horny monster but like with other stimulants they are vasoconstricters meaning it's sometimes difficult to get or stay hard. GHB is a vasodilator which does the exact opposite. Well, I think you know what Im coming at here. They are very synergistic and make for a very pleasurable time. But regular sex on these drugs can be very addictive and makes 'normal' sex almost boring (also goes for the following two combinations). I have to emphasize that mixing uppers/entactogens with downers can be extremely dangerous and should be avoided at any cost. If you still want to do it, please be responsible and use low-doses!\n\n**MDMA + GHB**: Very similar to the previous combo but more lovey-dovey and feels more personal, but still makes for a great time. I have to preface that mixing uppers/entactogens with downers can be extremely dangerous and should be avoided at any cost. If you still want to do it, please be responsible and use low-doses!\n\n**Amphetamine / Methamphetamine + GHB**: Combining stimulants and depressants can easily lead to compulsive redosing, increases your risk of an overdose and puts more strain on your cardiovascular system, especially when you mix in a 6 hour session of raw fucking. Mixing uppers/entactogens with downers can be extremely dangerous and should be avoided at any cost, but if you still want to do it, please be responsible and use low-doses!\n\n**2C-B + GHB**: One of my favorite combos ever, even when not used for sex as the G reduces the anxiety of psychedelics but enhances the euphoria. 2C-B was originally sold as an aphrodisiac and the combination of G and 2C-B is absolutely godlike. Highly recommend this combination if you're careful and you know what you're doing.\n\n**5-MeO-MiPT + GHB**: 5-MeO-MiPT's effect profile is a mix of an entactogen and a psychedelic. Its incredibly amazing also when used without G and without sex, but getting it on while on Moxy is freaking amazing. Especially with GHB.\n\n**honorable mentions**: LSD + GHB / Cocaine + GHB / Pyrovalerones + GHB / GHB or GBL / Phenibut / Cannabis + Alcohol\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##productivity:\n\n**Modafinil + Caffeine**: Relatively low abuse-potential imo because Modafinil is not really recreational, but it gets the job done. Long duration and especially when combined with caffeine you're most likely gonna be really productive.\n\n**Methylphenidate + Caffeine**: Similar to Modafinil and Caffeine but Ritalin is stronger, more euphoric and has bit more abuse-potential. It\u2019s still a good choice for productivity, but please don't use any of these drugs regularily, if you don't wanna become and emotionless human being.\n\n**4F-MPH** (+Caffeine): 4F-Methylphenidate is the RC super-version of methylphenidate. Stronger, cheaper, longer-lasting but not medically approved and thus pretty much an unstudied substance. Its very cheap and works well if your tolerance to Ritalin is too high, although I\u2019d rather taper or cut back if your tolerance is through the roof. Please do your own research!\n\n**2-FMA** (+Caffeine): 2-Fluoromethamphetamine is one of the most popular stimulants for productivity in the RC world but still pretty much an unstudied substance. Works better than 4F-MPH for productivity imo and has less side-effects. Its also readily available on the internet and really cheap. Please do your own research!\n\n**Lisdexamphetamine** (Vyvanse): This suggestion may be a little controversial and some people might prefer Adderall or Dexedrine over Vyvanse. I'm not saying I prefer Lisdexamphetamine over e.g. Adderall in general, but purely for productivity Vyvanse is the better option. Granted, the other suggestions are probably better choices anyway, because they are not as euphoric, so they\u2019re more functional and have less abuse potential.\n\n**honorable mentions**: 3-FPM (+Caffeine) / IPPH (+Caffeine) / Dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) / Levo + Dextroamphetamine (Adderall) / Dexmethylphenidate (Focalin) \n\n&nbsp;\n\n##my favorites:\n\n**Alcohol + Cannabis**: This combination is very common and absolutely amazing, if you mix them from the get-go or start with the Cannabis. Being drunk and smoking can make you nauseous and dizzy, if you dont have a tolerance. Great music-enhancement, they cancel out their negative effects and produce a strong euphoria.\n\n**2C-E**:  Its like 2C-B\u2018s big brother and demands more respect, feels colder, more visual (although darker), has a more loopy headspace and has a significantly stronger and different bodyload. Side-effects like nausea, stomach cramps, etc. are also worse. Its capable of producing euphoria that 2C-B wont be able to achieve, but is also able to induce a far stronger sense of dread and panic. More risk, more reward.\n\n**2C-B + Ketamine**: That's something special haha. It can be quite frightening to be numb and not being able to move while tripping because you're so aware of your dissociation, but the euphoria, the visuals and the bodyfeeling are absolutely incredible and out of this world, when you're prepared. Start lower than usual with the dosage on both substances. I advise taking bumps of ket when you feel comfortable on the 2C-B.\n\n**AL-LAD + 2C-B**: Unbelievably euphoric and the visuals were so impressive, that I couldnt believe my own eyes. Still relatively easy to control mentally but the visuals were so intense that I had to lay down because everything was whirling, spinning and moving. Absolute madness. Probably not the best idea if you're prone to HPPD.\n\n**4-HO-MET / 4-HO-MiPT + 5-MAPB / 6-APB**: Doesnt really matter what substance your mixing but the 4-substituted tryptamines are highly synergistic with the benzofurans. Its like a longer-lasting and better Hippie-Flip (mushrooms + MDMA). It can get pretty wild so don't take this combination lightly.\n\n**honorable mentions**: LSD / DMT / 4-MMC / 4-FA and a few more.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThank you for reading and I hope this post was somehow informative!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**EDIT: Thank you all for your nice words! As I predicted, there\u2019s a lot of controversy around what the best drugs or combinations are for different purposes, but people keep in mind that we\u2019re all different and this post should be taken with a grain of salt. I read all the comments and I gotta say that I\u2019m still happy with my choices, THE ONE THING I COULD\u2019VE MENTIONED THO IS \u201cSPEEDBALLING\u201d (An upper mixed with an opioid) in the \u201cpure pleasure / hedonism\u201d category. This feeling is arguably more pleasurable / enjoyable for some than opioids or methamphetamine alone. Thank you u/JuniperHillInmate for this suggestion!**\n\n**EDIT 2: Thank you for my first gold award stranger! I appreciate it!**\n\n**EDIT 3: Thank you for another award! :)**\n\n**EDIT 4: multiple grammar edits**\n\n**EDIT 5: added honorable mentions in all categories.**\n\n**EDIT 6: I reevaluated my choices in the \u201cpure pleasure / hedonism\u201d category and came to the conclusion that pyrovalerones and cocaine [IV or smoked] are better fits than 5-MAPB and MDMA, as they are purely recreational and arguably even more euphoric.

I couldn't control the images.. That wasn't very pleasant but when I decided to go look up old music videos I grew up watching.. I had this really nostalgic feeling I haven't had in a long time and it was a good kind of feeling because I feel like the experience brought up not only bad memories that I repressed but even some pleasant memories from childhood that I had forgotten..

You never came off preachy at all! I always knew that no one could ever help me if I was never opened to being helped or wanted to help myself.

I was acting rude around psychiatrists and social workers.. everyone.. I hated myself, I hated everyone and the world.. It was a really rough time. I just wanted to be dead. Now.. it's like.. I still have suicidal ideation once in awhile.... because I think of how much better it would be not to have to deal with the endless emotional pain but somehow.. even when going through self harm in whatever way.. there's this fear of just ending my life and there's still this dream of wanting to do certain things in this life.. Yeah, comparison is really the thief of joy but it's so hard for me not do that that with my siblings who are successful and both settled down with families right now.. It's not that I even want to get married and have kids tbh.. but just that I always feel like having more money and possessions would make me feel more useful and worthy of something.. Idk.. even when I know that's just \"shallow\" and superficial. I can't stop thinking of it as what I need to survive and be happy and confident. :/ And it drives me nuts that my mental disorders make it so hard to even just keep up with a part-time job sometimes..

I'm not implying that you're an addict, only you know that. I just know that sometimes people have cravings, but they don't really want to have drugs in their life anymore. It's just nice to know people who have felt like that before.

A paper in the Journal of the American Osteopathic noted that naloxone has no effect on kratom and this is probably because they are both antagonists or that mitragynine has a separate mechanism of action that isn't opioid activity. Just because kratom is a drug/medicine that can be abused like everything does not mean your opinion counts as medical science. The greatest benefit of kratom over classical opioids or methadone is that its very hard to overdose on kratom.

This is the substance i've used the most and some of the best and worst experiences of my life have involved alcohol. I don't usually get common side effects like nausea or dizziness and it can be quite euphoric in the right situations. \n\nWeed - 7/10\n\n3 or 4 years ago I would have given it an 8 or 9/10 but it makes me feel anxious now compared to the past when it didn't. With no tolerance it's like a very mild psychedelic that makes everything more interesting and exciting. It was great for my anxiety and depression and my favourite effect was it's music enhancement effects.  \n\nLSD - 10/10\n\nDefinitely one of my favourites. The first psychedelic I had tried, i've had some of the best experiences of my life on this drug. Less of a body load than shrooms and easier to control. Visuals and effects on headspace can be mild to extremely intense depending on dose, it can be very euphoric in the right set and setting. Listening to music is incredible on LSD. \n\nMDMA - 10/10\n\nAfter trying weed and alcohol, MDMA was the next thing I tried and I was blown away. An intense body high, lots of euphoria and bonding with other people on MDMA is one of the best feelings in the world. The comedown can be brutal but MDMA gives me one of the best highs out of anything so it's always been worth it for me.\n\nKetamine - 8/10\n\nHigher doses are hard to describe to people who have never done ket before. In low doses it makes me energetic and relaxed with no side effects. As the dose gets higher I become more disassociated with the world and the connection between my mind and body is inhibited in a strange but very pleasant way. High doses lead to the k hole which can feel like it's taking you to a different world, out of body experiences are common.\n\nVyvanse - 8/10\n\nA smooth long lasting amphetamine that can be really euphoric at the right dose.\n\nMeth - 10/10\n\nThe king of amphetamines but I don't recommend it to anyone. Very long lasting and also very euphoric. Can give a very strong rush depending on ROA. Extremely addictive and the only stimulant i've become hooked on. \n\nShrooms - 9/10\n\nI like it almost as much as acid but the bodyload and harder to control headspace stop it from being a 10/10 for me. I've had some amazing experiences on shrooms and I like it for all same reasons I like acid. It also has a much shorter duration than LSD which is ideal for some situations.\n\nTobacco - 5/10\n\nMild stimulant high that synergizes well with pretty much every substance. Especially great with stimulants and opiates. Very easy to become addicted to and becomes an expensive habit if you're addicted, it has a short duration as well.\n\nNitrous - 8/10\n\nReally pleasant dissociative high that has an extremely short duration. Great when sober but amazing if you use it while on psychedelics.\n\nDMT - 10/10\n\nCoke - 8/10 (10 if it's good quality and mixed with alcohol)\n\nThis one highly depends on the quality of the coke you're using. High quality coke is 10/10 but low quality is probably 7/10. Strong rush and very euphoric but it has a short duration which makes you snort lines every 30-45 mins if snorting is your ROA. Even better with alcohol but more dangerous. \n\nValium - 8/10\n\nOne of my favourite benzos with some really nice muscle relaxation effects. Has a long half life which means you can feel it for a long time, also the benzo i've used the most. great for anxiety and comedowns.\n\nOxazepam - 7/10\n\nThis benzo isn't anything special to me but it does it's job well. Short half life but great for anxiety and stress.\n\nAmphetamine - 8/10\n\nSimilar to prescription amphetamines like Vyvanse, Adderall, Dexedrine etc. but the quality can be very unpredictable.\n\nXanax - 7/10\n\nGreat for anxiety and sleep but it has a short duration compared to other benzos that I've used. Can easily lead to black outs if you're reckless with it\n\nKlonopin - 7/10\n\nVery subtle but long lasting benzo that is helpful in a lot of situations. As with all benzos, be careful with redosing and blacking out\n\nTemazepam - 8/10\n\nMy favourite benzo, gives a relaxing and warm feeling that feels better to me than other benzos. It also has a pretty short duration.\n\nHalcion - 8/10\n\nIs close to temazepam in terms of how much I like it. Has a short duration and hits you like a wall. Feels like a better version of Xanax\n\nDPH - 2/10\n\nLower doses are great for sleep and relaxing. Higher doses can be terrifying and make you feel like you are in a living nightmare, also known to cause seizures in high doses. I recommend to never use this drug in high doses\n\nAtivan - 7/10\n\nGreat for anxiety but nothing about it stands out to me compared to other benzos\n\nAmbien - 8/10\n\nGives a warm, relaxing feeling that is similar to some benzos. Also makes you hallucinate and gives you a very weird but enjoyable experience\n\nDxm - 10/10\n\nHeroin - 10/10\n\nOxycodone - 10/10\n\nMorphine - 9/10\n\nCodeine - 8/10\n\nDihydrocodeine - 9/10\n\nRitalin - 6/10\n\nMemantine - 7/10\n\nMethadone - 9/10\n\nGHB - 10/10\n\nPhenibut - 8/10\n\nEthylphenidate - 8/10\n\nTianeptine - 7/10\n\nTramadol - 7/10\n\nMDA - 9/10\n\nMXE - 10/10\n\nKava - 7/10\n\nGabapentin - 7/10\n\nLyrica - 8/10\n\nSoma - 9/10\n\nAsk me about any particular substance and I'll explain why I gave it that rating.", "author": "JimmySteve3", "score": 109, "flair": null, "created": 1597844479.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ichx8e/rating_of_every_drug_ive_taken/", "num_comments": 130, "title": "Rating of every drug i've taken", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"g22ph52": {"score": 52, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/ichx8e/rating_of_every_drug_ive_taken/g22ph52/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597845090.0, "body": "GHB is tops on my list of drugs I would like to try.

Especially not oxycodone, there are long-term consequences in the changes in your brain chemistry, and you are doing irreparable harm to your brain and your body. \n\nWait until you're 23 or 25, then do whatever you want, in the meantime stick to psychedelics and weed. at the very least, they would be considered less damaging.\n\nNobody on this forum can answer you properly, you have to do a calculation to find out.\n\nYou must calculate the rate of absorption, the rate of metabolism, the smallest threshold for an effective dose, the amount of tolerance gained with each dose, and the ratio of the diminishing return you will get with continuous use.\n\nYou will find that the more you use it, the more it will take to achieve the same effect and that you cannot maintain a normal baseline state without it if you choose to use it regularly.\n\nYour body, the way it is now, is in a state of equilibrium. When you use the substance, your body becomes used to having trace amounts of that substance at a certain proportion. If that proportion is not maintained, you will begin experiencing discomfort and withdrawals.\n\nThus, as time goes on you will need more and more to achieve the same effect, and you will need to be on it more often, just to feel normal and if you are lacking in the substance you will be craving it and desperately seeking it, just so that you can feel good again. \n\nBecause of this, you will eventually find to yourself walking a fine line between death from overdose and the maximum safe amount, just to feel somewhere close to what you felt the first time, or even just to feel normal. your body will have become dependent on having the substance, and a lack of it will cause great discomfort.\n\nSo the only way to do it responsibly would be to find out exactly how much of a tolerance you build up with each dose and how long it takes that tolerance to completely subside, then use that information to schedule your doses far enough apart that you do not form a dependency.\n\nThis assumes that you have the discipline to stick to the schedule that you set for yourself, and never to use more than the allotted dose that you calculated beforehand. \n\nThere is no margin for error with opiates, too much will kill you, too little won't do anything. If you increase the dose over time, the chances of forming a dependency and becoming addicted rises exponentially. This means there is no room to fuck around or make mistakes because it will cost you your life. This is more serious than anything you've ever faced in your entire life.\n\nSome good information to have would be how fast it is absorbed into your system, how fast your body gets rid of it, how long the duration of the effect of the dose is, how that scales up as the dose increases, and the maximum survivable dose for a person of your height, weight, and metabolic rate.\n\nAs for the rest of the people in this forum, consider this, telling someone not to do something because you had a negative experience in the past is unlikely to change their thinking and subsequent course of action, it is better to educate to them on the consequences of their actions and let them see the path that they chose to walk, and what lies at the end of it.\n\nDon't just say \"Don't do this thing.\"  Explain the thought processes and the underlying reasons and principles behind why the thing should not be done as well as how it will affect the person who does it.\n\nExperience may be king, but if you cannot help people to relate to and understand it, it may as well be useless.", "replies": {}}, "g7xrb6x": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/j64by3/hey_guys_i_got_some_questions_for_you_opiate_users/g7xrb6x/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1602046969.0, "body": "I dont use opiates but I have to side with everyone else here.

Firstly, this post is not to promote drugs, this post is to teach teenagers that are about to use drugs, and tell them the consequences, the downs, the depression, the brain damages, and all negativities.Because we adults definetly know that telling dont do is not gonna do anything :) So better guide for safety no one gets harmed.\n\nWhat things Below that I have used for long term what I call (1-6 months)\n\n1) Weed (3 years, every morning, every lunchtime, every afternoon , every night ; basically till I pass out peacefully, what I call dying :) )\n\n2) LSD( I did this 3 times, first one was Microdosing 25ug done for 2 weeks, second one for spirituality purposes which really scared me but no traumas thanks God that was extreme dosage 600ug, third time was more conscious and not crazy which was 250ug and that was a lovely experience walked outside slowly with Hiphop on my ear to cancel bad trips and stick to lyrics singing watching the sun rising, sittin on grass meditating with Theta Waves Sounds in my ear.)\n\n3) Mushrooms( Many many times, just for fun no spirtuality. I wish I done for spirituality after I made some research Mushrooms and meditating is real good one trust me. I tried the Chocolate ones, mushroom as itself ones original, and one time I did Mushroom which was the first time I tried I was a bit coward :) So I drank whiskey with it and it was really enjoyable but I ended up doing barfix with my friends outside at 3 AM injured my hand then I was saying funny things like \u201cDamn Im a Army Veteran, be a Soldier , bring me some whiskey we pour the this wound so bacterias die\u201d I was damn crazy, actually Im still crazy and fun for many people ahahah)\n\n4) Ketamine (I hated it, why the hell I would try that man. I dont like things that makes me dumb, slow thinking, slow response. But Im hyprocrite check out the 5th step and you get me)\n\n5)Codeine with Promethazine( My favorite, I got addicted to this one, I dont recommend to any of you guys, oxycodone too . Dont do it stay away! The withdrawals of it!?? Oh - My- Dear- Lord. Whole body hurts 24/7, when you lie down to bed it still hurts, you cant go to sleep, I even couldnt sleep with weed when I quit codeine , the weed was like not effecting at all, it was weird, and trust me I only get the A+ stuff, but overall I loved Codeine, calming down, but dangerous sometimes because if you miss the dose and keep goin your heart stops , its slows you that much.)\n\n6) lyrica(pregabalin 300mg) my favorite in the whole drugs industry. I was a extreme alhocolic. I would wake up at 4 AM, and start drinking at 12:00 lunchtime starting with 2 double whiskies, then go lunch and have some Wine, dont even ask the rest of the day, 70cl Whiskey mostly half of it, Weed included, sometimes xanax included. Real blackout. Why I tell this? Because Lyrica is the drug that make me quit Alcohol. Basically it makes me calm,chill, talkative, motivated, uplifted, energetic, always wanna chat with people , normally Im shy really :)\n\n7) Cocaine ( Maybe 7-10 lines working all nighter with coffee and weed to University things, was giving extreme dopamine to make me do work, but the wear off is like hell, and dangerous to mix with alcohol, so you have to hug the pain in this ones withdrawal)\n\n8) MDMA (my favorite, I took it and its like my friend touched my arm I almost came \u0131 swear. Its extreme warmness, extreme motivation, extreme talkativeness, very social, energetic, you would die because of the goodness of the music when you open it up. But stay away! Because I took it, and I was extremelly depressed, I sometimes cried because of sadness out of no where when alone , I cured this by weed, but Weed didnt even make me high at that time I swear on God.\n\n9)Extacy with Molly (I did this 3 times, all for celebrating after Uni Exams by the force of my ex evil. No blame but she introduced to me these chemicals, otherwise Id never do antrhing else than Weed. This is the best I can say but not good as Mushrooms and LSD, this was like you look at your friends face, his face turns to like Avatar like Blue Effects around Fire around, very visual but never bad trippin because it boosts your seratonin, you wouldnt trip bad on this.\n\n10) Homemade Ayahuasca (Syrian Rue+Acacia Confusa+Half Lemon Squeezed+Sea Salt one Nut large) - This was really good. But I tripped bad. It was a bad trip. Look , you see nothing scary, but you just feel like you so sticked to material world, and start feeling paranoid and unsafe. Ill figure this out and try again tho, am not gonna stop in this one.\n\n\nAlright so lets start the guidance;\n\nAs an example;\n1) If you taking MDMA always have a scale, and dont exceed the amount. When the MDMA wears of , if you cant bare the depression after that night dont take a second dosage ever, ever , never! Second dose can be good, but the next day? Im not even sayin only next day. The seratonin and dopamine will lack for months trust me. You wont find happiness for time.\n\nSo you took it measured it, drank some sprite for the bad taste (talking about pure crystal ones) \n\nEnjoy it, dont think bad things, and it wont make you think bad things this drug is like a happiness drug.\n\nDont mix with any alcohol, not even 1 beer. Are you gonna 100% die? No! But theres a chance of heart attack, statistics shows its more common in women. So dont mix. If you gonna mix with something and not listen to my words. Then mix with 1 pill of Extacy and enjoy it.\n\nWhen the effects are gone, only thing you gonna do, and nothing else! Is take 2mg of Xanax with water. Lie down, open some chill music, wait till sleep comes. Sleep, rest your brain. Thats how you dont damage your brain. If you awake eithout sleeping, you gonna be depressive mood questioning bullsh\u015ft things. So set OFF your brain, sleep rest. Wake up and drink organic mixture of fruits juice. Eat eggs. Start a nice day.\n\n\n\nFor LSD; 12 hours its gonna last. But 6 hours is the max climax. Same tactic when its off, take xanax and sleep.\n\nMushrooms, anything you wanna do is fine dont worry :) Its fun.\n\nWeed, do smoke weed when you on Mushrooms, when you on LSD, MDMA, Ex. Everything above. Always have weed with you roll like 5-10 rolls before taking the hard drugs. That weed gonna always put you in a calm trip relaxed trip.\n\nCodeine with Prometh; take 3 caps of codeine pour it in to Sprite bottle filled with Sprite, drop a Prometh for nausea , because it really makes you so nauseous otherwise. Never mix with alcohol . \u0130ts already strong calming thing you w\u0131nt need it. Dont exceed 1 week , to prevent addiction. Do this 3 cap thing max 3 times a day. Dont overd\u0131se its dangerous, you literally die.\n\n\nCocaine; you can multiple your doses at once. But just for once. Dont do all night. Take one bigline toright nose, take one big line to left nose. And you are fine for 1 hour. Dont waste the drug by taking more before 1 hour. Take xanax if you so depressed after your Cocaine finished at the end of the night.\n\nLyrica: Take 1 pill first, enjoy it its lovely. Next day take 600 up to 900 mg. \n\nOnly problem with high dose is it makes your hands shake , buzz. So if you use in public and get paranoid about gettin exposed only 1 pill enough to be social.\n\n\nMy hands tired. Ill keep writing my experiences. This is me when I was 19-20-21-22-23. Now Im off , just doing some xannies when I wanna celebrate.\n\n\nGod Bless you, always celebrate no medicate!", "author": "bleepyyy", "score": 369, "flair": "See Comments", "created": 1593235675.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hgggtx/safety_guidance_for_hard_drugs_and_prevent_brain/", "num_comments": 83, "title": "Safety Guidance for Hard Drugs, and prevent Brain Damage, minimize Depression my own Experience.", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fw46vo3": {"score": 218, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/hgggtx/safety_guidance_for_hard_drugs_and_prevent_brain/fw46vo3/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1593243560.0, "body": "To be honest I really don\u2019t think this is a very good post.

I\u2019m sure I\u2019m still missing some from this list. I did not include supplements or nootropics.\n\nRatings\n\nWeed - 10/10\nEven though I have had tons of highs that were full of anxiety and paranoia, I\u2019ve had plenty that were great. It\u2019s very safe, versatile, and can potentiate pretty much ANY other substance.\n\nAlcohol - 4.5/10\nIts a dangerous substance overall and I hate the taste, but it comes in handy in many social situations. I would rate it at a 9 for the positive effects and a 1 for the negatives as the negatives are worse than just about any other substance I\u2019ve tried.\n\nCaffeine - 5/10\nHas it\u2019s used but still gives me a crash which is sometimes not worth it. Overall I\u2019m glad it\u2019s around.\n\nKratom - 7.5/10\nWith no tolerance and good leaf, I would say the rating is closer to a 9. With bad leaf the effects are more like a 1. It\u2019s a pretty safe alternative to more dangerous substances which is what gives it a higher overall score.\n\nMDMA - 8.5/10\nEuphoria is out of this world. It changed my whole perspective on music permanently. In the right setting, it\u2019s an unforgettable experience. It would be a 10 if it wasn\u2019t so unsafe. Once or twice a year is fine, but I abused it when I was younger and it made me feel more depressed and worse than ANY other drug ever has before or since. I will only use it in a candyflip now and just don\u2019t feel the need to use it anymore. I did have some incredible experiences on it though and I also loved the nystagmus. Comedowns can be awful too. \n\nMDA - 8.5/10\nLess euphoric than MDMA but I had some of the most unique visuals on it when combined with weed. Still very similar to MDMA.\n\nLSA -  4/10\nWaaay too tired on this. Tried both MGS and HBWR seeds. MGS made me so sick that the thought of it makes my stomach turn 10 years later. HBWR seeds gave me actual psychedelic effects, but it\u2019s so hard to stay awake. Doesn\u2019t really compare to classic psychs.\n\nDMT - 10/10\nHoly Shit. Even the most intense LSD trips of my life don\u2019t compare to vaping DMT. My reality was shattered for weeks following my first experience. I still can\u2019t believe people can experience this.\n\nSalvia - 1-10/10\nI don\u2019t know whether to give this a 1 or a 10. The experience was as intense as DMT but full of fear. I still think about my breakthrough experience even a decade later. Even though it\u2019s terrifying, it is one of the most fascinating psychedelics I\u2019ve ever tried.\n\nLSD - 9.5/10\nBy far my favorite long lasting psychedelic. The entire world comes alive, dancing with geometry. I\u2019ve had lasting life changing experiences from LSD and have quit other drugs because of it. Combination with MDMA is the best combo of all time IMO. The revelations and feelings of oneness are unforgettable. It would be a 10/10 if it wasn\u2019t for the comedown and after effects running into the next day or 2 for me. I still love LSD though and always will.\n\nMushrooms - 8.5/10\nI\u2019ve had some insane experience on mushrooms full of love. I usually feel better immediately after a trip than before. The comedown is always so euphoric but I usually feel more uncomfortable during the trip than with LSD. I don\u2019t think the visuals are as pretty either. The body load and sedation is what keeps this score lower than LSD... plus the fact that it\u2019s just simply not as enjoyable as a good LSD trip.\n\n25c-NBOMe - 2/10\nFeels way to intense in a dirty way. Put 2 of my friends in the hospital during one of our trips and gave another one of my friends a seizure. The first 2 times we did it were okay which is why it isn\u2019t a 1/10. It is a very hollow experience though. Would never try again.\n\nKetamine - 9/10\nLow doses are fun. High doses are insightful. The best part is that I feel great for a week after using it. IM is much more intense than intranasal. \n\nDXM - 6/10\nSurprisingly good for what you can get at a convenient store. Haven\u2019t touched it in years though. Ketamine just feels like the cleaner version. High dose just has so much mind fuck that it can be unbearable. Great combo with weed whippets and music though. I\u2019d say my few experiences ranged from terrible to blissful. It\u2019s hit or miss and sometimes you will get itchy AF! Ketamine is better though IMO.\n\nSynthetic cannabinoids (unknown) - 2/10\nOnly smoked these (K2 and whatnot) as a teen because weed was illegal. Actually felt addictive. Some experiences were fun, but overall it is just such a dirty experience. Weed is safer and overall WAY more fun!\n\nAdderall - 7/10\nVyvanse - 6.5/10\nNothing better for focus. I would smoke tons of cigarettes too. Always got a good amount of euphoria from it. Only thing that doesn\u2019t combine great with weed is stimulants though. Daily use lead to lack of motivation, sleep deprivation and occasionally psychosis after too much sleep deprivation. I got so skinny and so constantly tired that I haven\u2019t touched either of these in years. I can\u2019t stand upper comedowns anymore. It was fun for a while but overall no longer a fan.\n\nCocaine - 3/10\nFun while drinking ONLY but shit on its own. Short duration and barely any euphoria. Tried multiple times and still never got anything from it unless we were drinking.... in which case it just helped us drink more. \n\nRitalin - 1/10\nSo inferior to amohetamine IMO. Made me feel awful during AND after. Couldn\u2019t even concentrate on it well. No euphoria, only uncomfortable side effects and a jittery wired feeling.\n\nFlexeril - 3/10\nGood for muscle tension... makes me very sedated in a not so pleasant way. Some use to potentiate opiates but I think it made them feel dirtier. \n\nSoma - ?/10\nI took a lot with some Xanax one day and woke up 24 hours later with my ex gf super pissed at me so... not sure how much I enjoyed it!\n\nKava - 4/10\nWas fun when we finally found some that worked. Problem is the hangover and the nausea. Overall not really worth it IMO.\n\nNitrous oxide - 6/10\nGreat (9.5/10) in combination with dissociatives or psychedelics but pretty useless by themselves unless you are at the dentist. \n\nGabapentin - 8/10\nPossibility for strong euphoria if done correctly. Best thing is feeling like yourself but completely anxiety/stress free as opposed to other gabaergics. Downside is tolerance builds basically immediately. \n\nLyrica - 8/10\nLike Gabapentin but somewhat trippier. Also need a much lower dose than Gabapentin too. Gabapentin is much easier to function on though which is why I gave them both 8/10.\n\nPhenibut - 7.5/10\nThere is a couple hours in the middle of a Phenibut experience that feels like a 10/10, but that is usually preceded and followed by a lot of strange side effects. I used 3x a week for a month once and couldn\u2019t believe the withdrawals I had. Primal fear is a good description. Won\u2019t use more than once or twice a month now and haven\u2019t had an issue. Wish the duration wasn\u2019t so long. Great in combination with LSD though!\n\nGHB - 5/10\nSuper fun at the right dose. Reason for the somewhat low score is that the dose response curve is way too sensitive. Trust me that no one wants to see you G out!\n\nAmbien - 3/10\nLunesta - 3/10\nI can\u2019t even give these a good score for helping to sleep because it never made me fall asleep, only hallucinate. These hallucinations would be like people hanging from my fingers or sleds running around the room. Tried a few times and not interested in trying again.\n\nDiphenhydramine - 1/10\nOnly use this for allergies. Deleriants are just not my thing. Tried it once when I was young and felt awful. Nasty hallucinations.\n\nBenzos - 5/10\nXanax - 4/10\nValium - 5/10\nKlonopin - 6/10\nAtivan - 6/10\nDefinitely still has a use for comedowns, but that is all I would ever use it for now. Daily use I would rank at a 1 due to the loss of memory, idiotic behavior, and horrifying withdrawals including but not limited to seizures and constant panic. All benzos feel pretty similar and really only the duration and level of sedation differs IMO.\n\nNicotine - 6/10\nI quit smoking cigarettes but still vape. I\u2019d like to think I hate it but in reality I quite enjoy it... especially with other substances.\n\nOpiates - 8/10\nHydrocodone - 7/10\nOxycodone - 8/10\nMorphine - 7/10\nPoppy Tea - 8/10\nCodeine - 7/10\nHeroin - 9/10\nAll of these feel pretty similar and I\u2019m only separating those that feel much different. Opiates if used responsibly have given me some of the most fun dates and most euphoric experiences. When abused I would give them a 1/10 due to the hellish withdrawals and severe lack of motivation. Poppy Tea has probably the WORST withdrawals since it last for hours and hours on just one dose. Poppy tea is the only one I almost OD\u2019d on consistently. Daily use of any basically just makes you into a dick. The high rating was more so before dependence and now I wouldn\u2019t go back.\n\nTramadol - 5/10\nI\u2019ve had some experience that I would rank higher (9/10), but I\u2019ve also had some very uncomfortable ones I\u2019d rank at a 2/10. Only euphoric in higher doses but that's when your seizure threshold lowers. Gave me a seizure after quitting Xanax from only one week of daily use. Can be good but too dangerous overall even compared to other opiates/opioids.\n\nTianeptine - 2/10\nWas good one time then the next made me feel super strange from the antidepressant effects. Not worth it and I hear withdrawals are terrible. Super short duration and barely feels like a traditional opiate.\n\nSuboxone - 4/10\nHelped me stay off opiates before I learned Kratom was a better alternative. Was sometimes good and can make you nod but rarely euphoric. With no tolerance you will most likely be sick. Withdrawals from suboxone are up there with Xanax. I had to come off both simultaneously and I will never be touching this stuff again.\n\nSeroquel - 4/10\nGood trip killer and good to sleep. Only included it because the sedation and munchies are intense (not in a recreational way though)\n\nTrazadone - 2/10\nGood to sleep. That\u2019s about it!\n\nTo do list:\nAyahuasca\nMescaline\n2c-b", "author": "FibonCarbor", "score": 146, "flair": "I :love: Drugs", "created": 1573099655.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/dslqa5/ratings_of_over_40_different_substances/", "num_comments": 75, "title": "Ratings of over 40 different substances", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"f6q5tc2": {"score": 33, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/dslqa5/ratings_of_over_40_different_substances/f6q5tc2/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1573100197.0, "body": "No Mescaline?!?\n\nBest feeling ever, pure peace & balance.\n\n11/10\n\n\ud83c\udf35", "replies": {"f6q6v7m": {"score": 8, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/dslqa5/ratings_of_over_40_different_substances/f6q6v7m/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1573100725.0, "body": "I could do it, I\u2019m just worried about nausea because I\u2019ve heard conflicting results!

After going through opiate addiction it\u2019s not the same. It induced anxiety for the longest time until recently. Now I use every day and it\u2019s nice but not on par with most of the drugs on this list. I do like that there is no physical dependency and no side effects. Definitely the safest drug on this list. \r\n\r\nOxycodone(8/10): I haven\u2019t used this one after developing opiate tolerance but it was nice and potent. I don\u2019t think it would do much for me nowadays. Also very expensive.\r\n\r\nCodeine(2/10): quite trash with any sliver of opiate tolerance. I tried taking 200mg recently and all it did was make my scalp extremely itchy and uncomfortable. I\u2019ve been dependent on Kratom for about two years though so I definitely have a tolerance. Kratom has much more effect.\r\n\r\nEtizolam(10/10 therapeutic 1/10 recreational): a phenomenal tool to have for anxiety, comedowns, bad trips etc. Not recreational in the slightest though. Higher doses just make me feel dull, depressed and disconnected.\r\n\r\nHydrocodone(5/10): with tolerance it takes A LOT and not cost effective at all. I prefer Kratom\r\n\r\nAmphetamine(4/10): Has me feeling good and motivated for about an hour, then I just become extremely irritable.\r\n\r\n4-fa(6/10): quite euphoric but not close to being on par with MDMA. Short acting though. Makes me quite irritable while also feeling good.\r\n\r\n2-fma(5/10): more useful than Amphetamine as a functional stim IMO. Smoother comeup/comedown and not much effect on mood.\r\n\r\n2cb(8/10): Very easy psychedelic. Great for beginners. Hardly any headspace and nice eye candy.\r\n\r\nMDMA(10/10): Pure unadulterated love on tap. High therapeutic and recreational value. Definitely an all time favorite. Any sort of \u2018frequent\u2019 use will fuck your state of being up majorly.\r\n\r\nMXE(9/10): Very high therapeutic and recreational value. Really wish I could\u2019ve experimented more with this one. Better than ketamine for sure. It has more depth to it.\r\n\r\nAlcohol(8/10): as an anxious person this is a great one to open me up although the hangovers are a nightmare. Very socially acceptable though, almost too much so.\r\n\r\nComputer Duster(1/10): it\u2019s basically dumpster nitrous. Extremely dirty \u2018wubwubwub\u2019 effect. I can feel the brain cells dying.\r\n\r\nDXM(7/10): this shit was magic when I was a teenager. Quite dirty though. I had an amazing experience on 300mg dxm and 30mg hydrocodone. It is quite unique compared to other dissos. I used this one very frequently for a period of time. It has very nice after glow but definitely causes some brain-fog. Don\u2019t have much desire to use again. I have fond memories of binging trailer park boys and hell on wheels on 300mg doses though. Also the song Dramamine by Modest mouse was my anthem at the time. That song sounded amazing on DXM. \r\n\r\nPropylhexedrine(4/10): dirty stim buzz with a ton of vasoconstriction. If you get it out of the inhalers then my god they taste HORRIFIC. It does have a bit of euphoria though and definitely has the potential to trigger a 6 hour masturbation session.\r\n\r\nClonazepam(6/10): my favorite benzodiazapine. Has a bit more of a livened mood than Etizolam/Xanax. Still sort of a low recreational value though.\r\n\r\n25c-NBOMe(2/10): took this one before I knew what psychedelics really did. No euphoria, just sort of a headfuck and very minimal visuals. The vasoconstriction was pretty bad. At one point I was afraid my dick was going to fall off.\r\n\r\nNitrous(6/10): if only it lasted longer. Quite expensive for a binge but it\u2019s definitely nice and pairs well with pretty much everything.\r\n\r\nBuspirone(1/10): terrible terrible terrible. Just a dirty anxiolytic. Benzos are much better. DON\u2019T INSUFFLATE THIS. It gave me nasty brain zaps. I was a stupid 16 year old.\r\n\r\nAmbien(2/10): sort of like a more wonky benzo. Not very recreational imo. \r\n\r\nSynthetic Cannabinoids(5/10): I\u2019m not sure the exact compounds. I used a blend back around 2015. I enjoyed it but it was pretty dirty. I never got the intense hallucinogenic effects that some describe. It was very similar to cannabis.\r\n\r\nPhenibut(9/10): Very nice mood booster, anxiety reducer and social lubricant. Also pair well with most everything. Super prone to dependency though and has quite a comedown for me even at low doses. I can count on being pretty depressed on the 2nd day after dosing.\r\n\r\nAlprazolam: about the same as Etizolam\r\n\r\nDMT: this one frightens me and I doesn\u2019t have much of a draw towards recreational use at all. This is strictly a tool imo.\r\n\r\nHeroin(10/10): Beautiful but I definitely had a problem with this one. It\u2019s the perfect escape. Numb to everything. I swear my whole family could\u2019ve died and all it would take is a shot and everything is just fine. Addiction has intense negative social impact. I isolated and ignored my issues for about 2 years. It leads you into a stagnant haze.\r\n\r\nLSD(5/10): I\u2019d have to try this one again. I had a bad first experience in which I smoked way too much pot on the comeup and lost most of my ability to comprehend/communicate. This was not good as an already socially anxious person in a social setting. I would like to try again though as I am more comfortable nowadays.\r\n\r\nKratom(9/10): saved me from heroin addiction but Kratom dependency is also a pain in the ass. I dose every 4 hours and interdose anxiety/depression is terrible. My mood is pretty much completely dependent on whether not I have dosed recently. Great mood boost and pro-social effects though. Reduces anxiety and calms but can also Amp you up a bit depending on strain/setting.\r\n\r\n3-Meo-PCP(6/10?): this one is very hard for me to recall. I think I used only about 100mg of this in total spread across different days. I would like to try it again. I did feel a bit of mania which I liked.\r\n\r\nFuranylFentanyl(4/10): the fentalogues have potent opiod effect but very low euphoria IME. Also very short acting. I couldn\u2019t imagine being dependent on them. Seems like a nightmare\r\n\r\nButyrFentanyl(4/10): same as FuranylFentanyl.\r\n\r\nU47700(6/10): more euphoric by quite a bit but also extremely short acting. Also very caustic.\r\n\r\nBuprenorphan(3/10): Good tool for addicts but hardly any recreational value. Takes away most of the physical withdrawals but I still have major cravings. Kratom does a much better job of keeping me clean.\r\n\r\nMethamphetamine(5/10): Used this one for quite a bit. I was mainly drawn to the pipe. Once I realized this was the case I smashed mine and never bought another. I had no issue quitting after that. If you can stick to oral dosing though it\u2019s basically Adderall on steroids. Much longer lasting and smoother come down. I never really experienced the intense euphoria people describe. Just got twacked and paranoid on many occasions.\r\n\r\nTianeptine(3/10): this shit is the devil. Do NOT IV. This is the crack of opiates. Pretty intense rush but less than 30 minutes later and you're mixing another shot. My tolerance rose 3x fold in one day. I used 500mg the first day then 1.5g the next before my 2g was gone. Never bought more because I realized just how dangerous this one could be. I believe this is literally this worst thing you could be dependent on. I hear it also destroys your opiate tolerance to the point where even methadone and fentanyl doesn\u2019t put a dent in WD. It's also extremely caustic and I highly regret putting this in my veins.\r\n\r\nButane(2/10): dirty nitrous like buzz\r\n\r\n2-Methyl-2-Butanol(2/10): extremely dirty benzo-like buzz. Purchased as a potential alcohol replacement while drug/alcohol testing. Tasted absolutely horrible and had some weird side effects such as frequent urination at night and sore/enlarged nipples. Here\u2019s is an in depth post on my experience: https://www.reddit.com/r/drugs/comments/amodap\r\n\r\n1,4-Butanediol(7/10): Very euphoric and has INSANE aphrodisiac properties. It\u2019s very recreational but frequent use lead to my first ever panic attack and fucked up my anxiety for months after. Do not use this one frequently. After a 3 day binge I was paranoid and extremely anxious. This one seems to induce benzo WD like symptoms after a very short period of use. Also fucked up my sleep majorly.\r\n\r\nTramadol(2/10): doesn\u2019t do much at all for opioid tolerant people\r\n\r\nGabapentin(8/10): this is a great tool. I used it mainly for easing heroin WD. The first time I used it in this manner it was a God send. I slept like a baby and felt no WD at all. The second time I had an emotional break down in which I came to the realization of what I was doing to myself with heroin. I had just started IV\u2019ing a week or two prior. I broke down on the floor crying. I was an emotional wreck. This seems to have sort of a psychedelic quality imo. I could see it being quite recreational when not going through WD.\r\n\r\nMethadone(8/10): pretty much pharma heroin. Less euphoria though. If you\u2019re actually trying to escape the life of opiate addiction I think suboxone is much better. Methadone still gets you high af. It\u2019s a full opioid agonist just like heroin and scratches the same itch. The main difference is it gets you away from the needle and you don\u2019t have to worry about where your next fix is coming from. \r\n\r\nKetamine(9/10): I love this one. Quite recreational with no physical dependency potential. Great positive effects on anxiety and depression. I find it hard to describe but it\u2019s sort of like a serene, disconnected alcohol like buzz. Very calming. I have yet to experience the 'hole'.\r\n\r\nKava(6/10): nice alcohol replacement. Has a sort of stoning quality to it. No hangover or WD. Eases anxiety and lifts mood quite nicely.\r\n\r\n4-aco-met(10/10): my favorite psychedelic. Nice euphoria. MDMA-like entactogenic effects. Eye candy visuals and hardly any mind fuck although my highest dose was only 15mg. Buddy took 20mg though and LOVED IT.\r\n\r\n2-fdck(8/10): Very very similar to ketamine but it lacks something.", "author": "Exa8yte", "score": 253, "flair": "Long Post", "created": 1596617066.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/i3viw4/44_drugs_ive_used_and_my_reviews_on_them/", "num_comments": 74, "title": "44 drugs I've used and my reviews on them", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"g0eakqg": {"score": 97, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/i3viw4/44_drugs_ive_used_and_my_reviews_on_them/g0eakqg/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1596618098.0, "body": "All this drugs and no psilocybin?", "replies": {"g0ec2f4": {"score": 34, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/i3viw4/44_drugs_ive_used_and_my_reviews_on_them/g0ec2f4/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1596618984.0, "body": "Yeah, I guess for the longest time RC tryptamines were easier to get and also far cheaper.

Soon you'll be able to write a novel lol.  But srsly, this is a pretty solid subjective general description of the drugs you've tried and I can find a lot of the experiences very relatable.  Otherwise, stay strong in this period of opioid addiction you're going through.  It's a good thing you didn't delve deeper into the tianeptine/fent experience.  That stuff is truly scary in regards to it's addictive and dependence forming potential.  I agree that fent is oddly non-euphoric, although still more sedating than most opes in the classic opioid fashion.  Some people however strongly disagree and get hooked, and when it comes time to quit, it can be a hell like no other.  Good you dodged that bullet.  As for tianeptine, if they're leaving it legal, they really may as well make hydro, tramadol, codeine, etc legal.  I'm all for the decriminalization and potential legalization of drugs, but it's hard to deny that tianeptine in such an odd-ball with regards to it's legal status in a lot of places.  If you are currently working on getting off kratom, whether you try to taper or go balls to the wall cold turkey, good luck.  Kratom withdrawals can be a real clusterfuck.  Personally, I actually used bupe to taper off and had much more success with that.  It unfortunately really isn't the walk in the park it's frequently made out to be once you get to the high doses it sounds like your on.  Regardless, don't shy away from recovery if you get to the point that you decide you're done with life on opes.\n\nOne more thing I'd like to add is that propylhexedrine can be a really interesting drug if you decide to do an acid base extraction with it.  It's kinda at a disadvantage when comparing it to other drugs if you're just putting the cotton in OJ or something or just eating it straight because of just how fucking nasty it can be.  Propylhexedrine HCl when taken routes other than orally (NOT IV!!!  IV PROPYLHEXEDRINE CAN KILL) imo seems to be absorbed much better and come with much more pleasant effects.  When smoked, it's actually an interestingly chill stim high you wouldn't expect from propylhexedrine considering how adrenergic and intense it feels taken orally.  There's definitely a lot less vasoconstriction, and you need very little to go a long way.  It also really made me really wanna redose smoked.  I did bing it for a while which was a bad idea because the cardiac effects became increasingly apparent with each consecutive dose and it's pleasant effects became less and less apparent very quickly.  Smoked, it personally kinda feels like a mix of Ritalin and a little bit of dxm.  It's really a high of its own.", "replies": {"g8khnsw": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/i3viw4/44_drugs_ive_used_and_my_reviews_on_them/g8khnsw/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1602512012.0, "body": "The highest I've gone regarding Kratom use is ~20gpd.

I subconsciously started dosing more frequently simply in response to interdose withdrawal symptoms (anxiety, racing thoughts, fatigue, yawning, nausea, sweats, and sniffles) and making a concrete dosing schedule to stick to each day was difficult.  I was able to get bupe from an addiction specialist even though I was just taking kratom.  I may have gotten lucky, but it seems like more and more specialists are becoming aware of kratom addiction.  They waited for me first to go into withdrawals and gave me clonidine before letting me have sub even though it seems that people don't generally require a induction period during the switch from kratom to bupe.  I was with my mom at the time, and when she called and discussed my symptoms, they gave me 4mg and told me to take two mg every two hours until I felt comfortable.  It sounds like you already have some experience with sub so you probably have a vague idea how to dose.  For example, I took 8, and frankly that was quite high. I also had a pretty large habit compared to what you got going on at this point.  You could probably get away with 2mg or so at this point (try 1-1.5mg first).  \n\nThe interdose withdrawal with sub tapering is definitely noticeable, but not nearly as intense or sudden ime, and that frankly made a big difference along with the fact that I really didn't need to schedule doses (just took one in the morning and one in the evening).  Overall I had some crankiness, fatigue, mild hot flashes, sniffles, yawns, stretching, tummy troubles, etc but it was generally very mild.  Even though I would say the physical withdrawals from sub are definitely less severe that physical withdrawals from other opes, I would say they can be overall a little bit more prominent than with kratom, but it was definitely less intense psychologically.  I actually got overall pretty sleepy while tapering, although at the start of my taper I unsurprisingly had some sleeping troubles.  Regardless of what you're tapering with, you can expect that.  With tapering sub, you gotta go slow because of how long it takes for sub to leave your system.  I did a 25-33% dose reduction every 3 weeks to a month, which was definitely enough time to recover.\n\nSorry these are so damn long.  Good luck man.  Worst case scenario, you can't find sub from any doctor in your area or you don't feel it helps that much with your taper.

Really?", "replies": {}}}}, "fkffqu": {"text": "Shrooms: 100/10-6 times\n-Every human on this earth should experience the beautiful wonders this \u201cdrug\u201d has to offer. I quote that because making a fungus illegal is so gay. (I\u2019m gay, I can say that). I prefer the time period of shrooms more than acid because it\u2019s not overwhelmingly long and you don\u2019t get stuck within time. The visuals are less geometric like acid and more earth like or cartoon like depending on the shroom. Every time I\u2019ve done it, I could see the cells that created my arms and the previous life of all the items in the room. Profound and grounding with loads of natural euphoria. The absolute best part of shrooms is the natural coordination it has with music, meaning color changes on the beat, words and music-video-like experiences. I also recommend listening to a guided meditation on shrooms, its something you will thank me for. \n\nTramadol: 10/10-100+ times\n-I can\u2019t with tramadol. I can\u2019t. This is what I thought Percocet would feel like, literal heaven. I know this isn\u2019t the popular opinion but tramadol hits different. It\u2019s soooooo warm and cuddly. I know I can\u2019t do this too often because the euphoria is so cozy and amazing that I can\u2019t comprehend it, and it feels too good to be true, but for the sake of this post... have you ever been in a hot tub in the winter? Where your brain is tingling and cool while your body is warm and relaxed and comfortable? This is semi close to the feeling of tramadol but 10x better. I know certain people can\u2019t metabolize it correctly but the SSRI effects have got to be why this is one of my DOC\u2019s. I\u2019m sorry if you are one of those people, you are missing out.\n\nAmbien: 9.5/10-2 years\n-I LOVE Ambien. Still prescribed for insomnia, 10 minutes after taking Ambien I begin to hit an intense calm head high that I wouldn\u2019t explain as euphoria, but it\u2019s SOMETHING. The subtle hallucinations accompanied with calm demeanor lead me to think this is a perfect chill night drug and the sleep following is the best sleep I\u2019ve ever had. It is also fun to note that I don\u2019t experience comedowns but that could be because I\u2019m dead asleep.\n\nVyvanse: 9/10-2 years\n-To this day Vyvanse is a blessing for my ADHD and in comparison to Adderall, Vyvanse is so much less jittery. I feel like Vyvanse is a clean version of meth WITHOUT the withdrawal. Every time I dose, my eyesight becomes crystal clear (my favorite part) and I can see sharp details from miles away. It\u2019s crazy. The first time I took my Vyvanse, I didn\u2019t realize until night that I had never put my contacts in, I just forgot because on Vyvanse I don\u2019t need my contacts. I can see better than if I wore contacts without Vyvanse. As well as a soothing euphoria I can feel in the front of my head and loads of motivation. (I\u2019m writing this on Vyvanse among other things.)\n\nVicodin: 8/10-20+ times\n-I love opiates, but there is something about Vicodin that is more sedative to me very similar to the feeling of a few martinis and a line of blow. It\u2019s a dizzy, fun high with and the euphoria is not like oxy, in the way that I feel so happy I just can\u2019t open my eyes. I really like Vicodin when I have to fly. \n\nDmx: 8/10-3 times\n-I did triple C\u2019s in high school when I didn\u2019t know how dangerous it was, it was the only thing I could get one week and my parents really though I had a cough so I was down. I took 12 pills and then fell asleep for an hour, I then woke up inside my mattress. I\u2019m not kidding. Every turn of my head made my head spin around and around and I realized that I was totally outside of my body by at least a few inches. I loved it.. I think. Walking was super hard and I slurred all my words. It was quite neat. \n\nKratom: 8/10-frequent use\n-I actually kinda dig this soft opioid, its a good mood enhancer that makes you feel a tiny bit floaty but is also not too extreme to do during the day. If I can\u2019t fill my vyvanse prescription, I\u2019ll use kratom instead because low doses feel kind of energizing like coffee. The only thing is\u2026 the taste is so bad. If there is a capsule option, please take it lol.\n\nKlonopin: 7.5/10-100+ times\n-this is the best drug I\u2019ve tried for anxiety, I can\u2019t stress on this drug. Like it\u2019s not possible. Even low doses of klonopin are soothing and relaxing and make me feel more in control of my anxiety. Obviously now, if you\u2019ve read this list, you know I have bad bad bad anxiety, and if you compare, maybe you should talk to your doctor about klonopin. When did this turn into a commercial?\n\nAcid: 7/10-5 times\n-Acid is a very meaningful experience and the colors and patterns my mind creates on it fascinate me and inspire me. This drug is absolutely the most creative (for me at least) and always has me wanting to draw or listen to music. If I\u2019m in a creative slump, acid always motivates my mind to experiment with more. Acid is a very chemical feeling to me, unlike shrooms, I can feel electric pulses and I don\u2019t hate it, but unfortunately, the 14 hour long headache after is what get me. which leads me to think that I can only take it once a year to still appreciate its beauty.\n\nPercocet: 7/10-6 times\n-I enjoyed the warm feeling and the happiness, but I was expecting a full orgasm from what people told me, and it honestly kinda disappointed me. I did feel the heavy-head nodding bliss but it came in waves. I know this isn\u2019t the popular opinion but I\u2019d much more rather pop a tram than an oxy, sowy..\n\nAdderall: 7/10-used to be prescribed for a few years.\n-I like adderall a lot for going out dancing and when I need to be productive. Recreationally it makes me paranoid and super jittery.\n\nWeed: 6.5/10-5 years\n-See, if I were still in high school, I would say a 9 or 10 because hot boxing my car and chillin with friends was possibly some of the more fun memories I have. I love the euphoria of smoking tree but as I\u2019m growing up I\u2019m realizing that weed gives me serious anxiety (socially and generally). Dab seriously ruins my lungs and throat and edibles have to be over 300MG per serving for me to feel literally anything. I still like to smoke a blunt every once in a while especially if I\u2019m tripping.\n\nCocaine: 6/10-50+ times\n-Good times. sometimes. Cocaine is pictured in movies all the time like it feels like Meth but I feel like the only way to compare it to something is a soft more-euphoric Adderall with coffee but short lived and not worth the price. If I can save money to spend on taco bell, I will. The only reason why coke doesn\u2019t get a 5/10 is because I like that I can sleep well on it.\n\nXanax: 6/10-10+ times\n-Ehh. Although the calmness that Xanax gives is quite enjoyable, I really feel like this is more useful for what it\u2019s actually prescribed for unless you want to stop a bad trip, this is perfect for that. Unlike ambien, xanax has no hallucinations or euphoria, more just content tranquility. Z-drugs are better than Benzos. Also the benzo subreddit is poop.\n\nMeth: 4/10-2 times\n-Have you ever felt sweaty and gross? That pretty much wraps that up. But for context\u2026 I was invited over to a party and at one point in the night I was asked to be in a 3 some but at the same time I was asked to be in a circle in another room to try \u201cT\u201d. I unfortunately didn\u2019t know what that meant at the time and chose T over sex with strangers. Within the first 3 minutes of my inhale, I felt an electric-like impulse flood through my body and I couldn\u2019t stop freaking out. Bad anxiety+Meth=hell no. I felt like how they portray meth to be on TV.\n\nMolly: 3/10-3 times\n-the most overrated drug of them all. Terrible withdrawal, nausea, puking, paranoia, and the list goes on, but all for what? 2 or 3 hours of euphoria that I could get with an opiate. Actually the opiate would be stronger. Sorry to bag on molly but there are better drugs that exist, stop living in the 1980\u2019s. The only good thing I gained from my experiences was the first time I did molly with a couple close friends for my birthday, we had great conversations and I felt a lot of empathy for them and connected more with them on a personal level. \n\nGHB: ?/10-1 time\n-this one needs a redo. GHB intrigues me because the one time I did it felt basically like 20 shots compressed into 1 squirt and after an hour I forgot about everything that had happened. So I want to give this another try. If you have tried this what are your thoughts?\n\n   Drugs I have not yet tried but want to try:\n\n-peyote (priority #1, I\u2019m growing it because it fascinates me so much) if you have taken peyote, please please please tell me your experiences with it.\n\n-dmt (after watching the guy flip out on Hamilton\u2019s Pharmacopeia and almost drown, I have convinced myself I need to be more than ready when I do it).\n\n- salvia (this one also scares me).\n\n-ketamine (everyone says this is amazing).\n\n-heroin (just once. Seriously. Just once I swear.)\n\n-Valium (do I have to be/know a mom to get this?)\n\n   Words of wisdom:\n\n-Opiates are so great. Too great. If you haven\u2019t messed around with them than don\u2019t start. They can be intensely amazingly awesome and I think this isn\u2019t helping me prove my point. DONT try them haha. \n\n-If you are depressed or feel like you don\u2019t matter, psychedelics (mostly shrooms) can be absolutely life changing and non habit forming. Take some shrooms and listen to your favorite music outside in nature alone in a safe place. Then listen to some guided meditations to rinse out your bad thoughts and leave them wherever you went.\n\n-If you are scared to try something someone is offering to you and they are pressuring you, just tell them you are on something like oxycodone and you can\u2019t mix drugs, they won\u2019t ask questions. Except maybe if you have more oxy lol.\n\n-The reason why I\u2019ve tried so many things and haven\u2019t had a funeral is because I NEVER mix things. Ever. Don\u2019t potentiate your drugs with another drug unless it\u2019s weed. If it\u2019s loosing it\u2019s edge, that means take a BREAK! \nNever do the same substance 3 days in a row, the rule is 2 days high: 3 days sober.\n\nTell me your thoughts and experiences!!

You just need to know the relative risk and research interactions between those compounds. For example dissociatives and psychedelics cause low toxicity on their own and in combination and they also go together very to create a wholly unique drug experience, same with MDMA and lsd/shrooms. Then using things like benzodiazepines on comedowns are very helpful for putting you to sleep after tripping or stimming. Downers with opioids or other downers is one of the most dangerous combinations, but it can be done reasonably safely by some people, still not recommended though. Stimulants and opioids is also one that is seen as more risky but this is primarily due to the contradictory effects of the two substances that can lead to excessively high doses being tolerated.

I\u2019m going to categorise them, rate them on 10 then explain further. I\u2019ll also add stuff to this list every time I try a new drug. Thanks to those who\u2019ll read this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBenzodiazepines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Alprazolam: 4/10 I\u2019m gonna preface this by saying I\u2019ve never been one for benzos they just make me feel fucked up and make me lose control and I\u2019m kind of a control freak. Now this is the second benzo I\u2019ve ever tried and I just remember (or not lol) me being barred out at a party and in class. It wasn\u2019t really special. In low doses it\u2019s enjoyable but in high doses it just fucks me up and makes me do dumb shit. Never gonna do alprazolam again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Etizolam: 2/10 Now Etizolam is even worse. the first few times I took it I felt great, it killed my social anxiety, it was really useful. But since I\u2019ve been taking higher doses even small doses fuck me up and I don\u2019t really know how to describe it but it feels \u201cunclean\u201d. I feel dizzy and I can\u2019t focus it\u2019s the worst I only use it as trip killer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Clonazolam: 6/10 Only did it 3 times and once to stop a trip but from my experience it\u2019s the only benzo until now that was really enjoyable. Felt calm, not too dizzy, could remain focused. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Flunitrazolam: 7,5/10 This one has 0 recreational value in my opinion I only use it to calm down panic attacks or when I have trouble falling asleep but it does a killer job at doing those two things! Watch out tho it\u2019s extremely potent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Valium: 7,5/10 Pretty cool tbh. I use this one therapeutically in small dosages and it's awesome to take the edge off without getting too groggy!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDissociatives:\n\n\\* Nitrous: 9/10, This drug is just pure bliss I love it so much. I\u2019m crazy for disais but this is more than that I\u2019m just cut off from the world and feel so euphoric. Only bad side is that it lasts so short. If I could get a drug that gives me these effects but longer that would definitely be my fav.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Ketamine: 4,5/10, Ketamine makes me feel very weird. It's kinda indescribably cause saying it feels like being drunk or nitrous or comparing it to other stuff doesn't do it justice. But I don't really enjoy it. It makes me kinda panicky. After trying it 3 times I decided to stop trying to like it. I think it's that kind of drug where you either love it or you hate it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStimulants:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* MDMA: 9/10 Now this, this is one of my favourite drugs it makes everything perfect and I\u2019m just crazy for it. It\u2019s worth the 3 month wait because it makes me feel so cathartic and blissful. You don\u2019t have to worry about where you take it or with whom, it will make your night perfect. I\u2019ve bonded with a lot of people thanks to this and it\u2019s probably one of my favourite drugs ever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Cocaine: 9/10 this one is amazing. The ego boost is crazy good. Also it\u2019s not as euphoric as opiates for example (at least not much physical Euphoria) but damn it gives you a nice mood boost. I love this one but only as a treat once in a while cause it\u2019s a little too \u201cbusy\u201d I\u2019d say so ye!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Ritalin: 10/10 This stuff doesn\u2019t really have a lot of recreational value maybe just a little euphoria but I\u2019m giving it a 10 cause it made me pass my year when everyone, all teachers told me it was impossible for me to pass. It\u2019s the only reason why I\u2019m starting uni and I\u2019ll always be grateful!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Caffeine: 7/10 Keeps me awake, gets me through the day. I used to get a rush from it but I built a tolerance. It helps me perform my daily tasks, keeps me focused, gets me out of bed and weirdly it helps me sleep idk why.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Adderall: 6/10, Now I definitely get how people like this one and can get addicted to it but idk... It made me very anxious and jittery. So much that my muscles actually ached. But I did get some euphoria the next few times I used it in lower dosages. It's fun but a little too much for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Vyvanse: 8/10 I love Vyvanse! I'm usually not that into stims but this is a really good one. It can really help with productivity but can also be very recreational (especially right after it kicks in). It's basically adderall with none of the negative side effects but a little less euphoria.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*2-FMA: 8/10 Almost identical to Vyvanse except for the duration. I also believe this one might be a little bit more recreational imo. But yeah they're very similar. I stopped using it as study drug cause it's a research chemical and we still don't know enough about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Isopropylphenidate: 6/10 Not euphoric at all. Maybe a little mood boost. I could barely feel it. Kind of disappointing I expected a little more cause it didn't really help me with my classes but it did make me sweat a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* 3-FPM: 6,5/10 I consider it a speedier and a little more euphoric version of Ritalin. Not that good. Kinda fun, makes me fidgety. Pretty good when mixed with opiates. But the flu you sometimes get the next day is just horrible that\u2019s why I tend to stay away from it and especially avoid binges!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Nicotine: 8/10 Damn do I love Nicotine. The buzz feels so good and it is about the only drug I can mix with every single other drug. Only sad thing is tolerance builds crazy quick and well smoking is bad for your health. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOpioids:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Kratom: 7,5/10 Kratom is very good. I personally can't stand the taste so I have to buy capsules, doesn't really matter tho. It can be very sedating but can also boost your productivity. Definitely euphoric in higher dosages. Helped me get off opiates multiple times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Oxycodone: 8,5/10 The first drug I ever got addicted to (technically the only one but I switched to heroin). I remember the first time I did this I was on my way to school just half nodding out on the tram like \u201cWow I have never felt this good\u201d it\u2019s sad that it loses its special side, when you develop tolerance it's more like \u201cAight euphoria\u201d but it lost its magic after months of abuse (who would\u2019ve thought). The euphoria is so good it\u2019s better than anything I\u2019ve ever done. Just watch out don\u2019t try this if you\u2019ve never done opiates. Don\u2019t get into them, chipping doesn't work, STAY AWAY!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Tramadol: 8/10 This one is a unicorn in the opioids. It definitely gives u a mood boost and euphoria. Some people can't metabolize it AFAIK so they don't get a lot of effects. It does feel very idk \"chemical\" and you can definitely feel it working as an SSRI. Very good one, first opioid I ever did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Opium: 0/10 I got no effects from this. 30 bucks wasted. Huge disappointment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Heroin: 8/10 I preferred oxycodone but if u get into an opiate you'll probably step over to heroin at one point, mainly because of the price. It's way more sedating than other opiods I've tried but in terms of euphoria I think it's about the same, maybe a little less, as oxys. You should stay away from this whole category except maybe kratom tbh. It's really really not worth it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPsychedelics:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* LSD: 7/10 A classic, it\u2019s pretty good, I like wandering around town with friend. We always go on these little adventures it\u2019s always loads of fun. The nausea I get on the come up though is horrible. Also it lasts too long for me. I love psychedelics but when they last too long they just make me tired and make me feel like I\u2019m wasting time, whatever that means.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Salvia: 6/10 This stuff is fucked up. Don\u2019t expect to have fun on this. It\u2019s so weird but also very interesting. I have a love-hate relationship with this one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Mushrooms/4-AcO-DMT: 8,5/10 I love mushrooms they\u2019re my favourite psychedelic. Way more visual than LSD for me and more stoning which I like. I love just sitting in a park or garden with friends and tripping balls. Nature is so good, I feel connected to everything, it\u2019s perfect. Big recommendation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Weed 4/10: I don\u2019t really like weed it makes me asocial and makes me feel dumb. I get anxiety sometimes and it\u2019s just not enjoyable for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* 2C-B: 9/10 Makes for a fun time. You get visuals and some euphoria. Psychedelic but you don\u2019t feel overwhelmed and way chiller. I would describe it as LSD light. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOthers:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Alcohol: 6/10 Very fun with friends and at parties for dancing. But once I'm alone it just makes me feel bad tbh...

I\u2019m writing this as a guide of some sorts for people who:\n\n- Have long term PE\n- Have had appropriate medical work up\n- Do not have current severe psychological distress (depression, anxiety, self esteem issues...etc) that effect their sexual performance\n- AND have had no success with other treatments.\n\nI do not recommend medications if you\u2019ve recently developed PE without a previous history, this must be investigated by a doctor as it could be due to a multitude of factors (hormonal, vascular, mechanical, psychological..etc).\n\nI\u2019ve had PE since my very first sexual encounter, and I\u2019ve never lasted more than 20-30 seconds. A few years ago I was placed on an SSRI for anxiety and it actually helped my PE. So I began the process of researching these meds and finding the right one/balance for me. I\u2019ve had a normal sex life since then. I am a young doctor myself so It was natural for me to search for medications for my issue. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve come to find out through this journey.\n\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are antidepressant/anti anxiety medications that can prolong time to ejaculation. Studies have shown that Paxil (paroxetine) has the best effect, followed by lexapro (escitalopram) and other types of SSRIs or SNRI. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) can also do this, but they have many more side effects and are generally not necessary to try. The same goes for most other psychiatric medications, due to their serotonin effects. \n\nThrough the different medications trials I\u2019ve personally had I\u2019ve found that medications that effect dopamine tend to speed up time to ejaculation, and intensify orgasms. Wellbutrin (bupropion) is a classic example, and it\u2019s actually given to HELP with \u201csexual dysfunction\u201d due to SSRIs in people without PE. To speed up ejaculation time. Another class is ADHD medications, specifically stimulants (both amphetamine and methylphenidate compounds). Medications with norepinephrine can cause erectile dysfunction as it can cause vascular constriction. Wellbutrin is such a medication. But not everyone gets that side effects. \n\nNot everyone responds to the same medications the same way. \n\nDifferent metabolic profiles definitely play a role, as some people use up the medications faster than others. Also MANY psychiatric medications also have SOME serotonergic, dopaminergic, or adrenergic effects that are not their main targets, these are called side effects. For example, some SSRIs (like sertraline or Zoloft) or SNRIs (venlafaxine, duloxetine) have dopaminergic effects at higher doses. And I think it\u2019s why they don\u2019t help with PE (they\u2019ve been studied for it).\n\nI\u2019ve said all this to say that if you choose to pursue medications, you may have to be patient and try multiple medications, at varying dosages, to find the right regimen for your body. Here is my personal experience with the ones I\u2019ve tried:\n\nZoloft: barely helped with PE, caused some erectile dysfunction. These effects did not change with the dosages I\u2019ve tried (up to 100mg).\n\nPaxil: Significantly improves my PE even at very low doses. Very minimal effect on erections. At 20mg+, I was not be able to have an orgasm during sex at all. Quit it because of excessive sedation.\n\nWellbutrin: caused erectile dysfunction, worsened PE, intensified orgasms.\n\nLexapro: Significantly helped with PE. When taking 10mg at 8am. I could not orgasm during sex within the first 2 hours (when the medication concentration is highest in the body). But after, I\u2019d last 5-10 min on the first round. And much longer on a second round. No side effects. I still take this once a day. \n\nI\u2019ve also tried finasteride, for hair loss. It actually also helped significantly with PE at 1mg. But, some people report decreased libido, because the medication blocks DHT. \n\nPsychiatric medications can have many side effects depending on the person. I\u2019ve not listed them here as they can be found online. One effect in particular is on mood, as some people report \u201cflattening\u201d of their mood or personality. However ALL these effects are dose dependent and, more importantly, reversible. Therefore, if you experience them, you can always stop the medication and return to normal. This applies to their effect on PE as well. These medications are not a cure. They would be taken daily. I\u2019ve personally accepted that and I just take them in the morning and go about my day. \n\nI hope this helps. I\u2019ve tried not to make this too long.

Missing ketamine on your list. You\u2019ll love it heavy Sinky fluffy feelings", "replies": {}}}}, "es0yjy": {"text": "Hi there. My name is Ben, and I'm a senior in high school. I have struggled with depression during many of my teenage years, and that has influenced a lot of my decisions. As such, I began using drugs early and have used drugs for all of my teenage years, first smoking weed when I was 13. I have used all types of drugs occasionally (weed, MDMA, amphetamine, methamphetamine, heroin, oxycodone, hydrocodone, Ambien, LSD, mushrooms, and many more) for years. This post is not me begging anyone not to do drugs, nor to do them. I believe in strongly in civil liberty and the right to do as one wishes as long as they don't harm others.\n\nI have not smoked weed regularly in more than a year, and not at all in the past 6+ months.\n\nBut out of all the drugs I've done, I have had the most trouble with the drug often touted as the most harmless out of any of these: weed. It has been the bane of my existence these last couple years, and it all in all has destroyed much of who I am as a person. But before you run to comment and disagree with me, let me explain, and once again reiterate that I think anyone can do drugs safely - in moderation. And it is with weed that most struggle with moderation; I know that many smoke weed every single day, including teenagers. For the common adult, I can't speak of the risk you're taking, but for adolescents, I can: you are destroying your reward system and the symptoms very well may last into adulthood, as mine have.\n\nFor over a year, I smoked weed every day. During my sophomore and junior years, I essentially lived and breathed weed. The longer I smoked, the more I indulged. I didn't see it as a problem because I figured that it couldn't harm me permanently. I began smoking many times a day, as much as I could. Over the summer between my sophomore and junior year, it was all I did. I essentially had no social interaction apart from what took place with my immediate family. I began to notice my social skills declining significantly, as well as my ability to concentrate or focus on anything at all. This persisted and continued to get worse over time, and eventually every time I smoked weed it got really bad. (I must note that many other drugs began to have a similar effect on me - alcohol, amphetamine, caffeine, opioids stopped working altogether. It's not nearly as bad as weed, but I lose the ability to focus and am ridden with anxiety. This is important because these drugs are primarily dopaminergic, but drugs that are primarily serotonergic affect me almost normally, notable examples being MDMA, meth to a degree, and psilocybin mushrooms). I would be useless for the duration of the rest of the day after I smoked any amount, even the tiniest of nugs, and I would feel depressed for a couple days after. I opted to quit because it was taking a toll on me and was no longer enjoyable. I stopped smoking altogether except for a few outlying situations a few months after the school year began. And that should have been the end of it - at least the beginning of the end.\n\nBut it wasn't. Fast forward to more than a calendar year later, and I still have these issues. They have eaten me alive. I cannot focus on anything at school, my memory is terrible, I have bad anxiety, I can barely hold a conversation, my emotions are numbed/nonexistent, I'm tired absolutely all day no matter how much sleep I get, and I essentially have an inability to feel anything at all (emotionally - including being happy, sad, scared, etc). I have tried several things to counteract this, the only one remotely successful being exercise. It has caused me many, many problems, particularly regarding schoolwork. I'm not used to struggling with school or anything academic; I'm not bragging, but to exemplify the drastic change, I have a 34 on the ACT and I'm a national merit (semi)finalist. I have lost almost all of my friends due to my social ineptitude and difficulty communicating, despite me trying extremely hard to keep myself normal. I have failed.\n\nAnd it was yesterday that I realized why. I was contemplating why LSD was not very fun for me compared to other people and doing a bit of research, and someone had said that it was significantly more dopaminergic than mushrooms, which I enjoy far more than LSD. It prompted me to Google the symptoms of [dopamine deficiency](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/4z74as/low_dopamine_symptoms/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) - and I have almost every single one of them (you can Google for sources that aren't Reddit, just search \"dopamine deficiency\"). The difficulty concentrating, the difficulty maintaining eye contact, the constipation and other GI issues, the difficulty learning - it all makes complete perfect sense. It is a perfect account of everything that ails me. \n\nIn addition to this, I found a study that researches the problems mice have when repeatedly exposed to THC in adolescence. It damages their GABA system, which significantly lessens production of it which persists into adulthood, despite the discontinuance of the administration of THC.  [Article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3930618/)\n\nBased on what I've read, the GABA system functioning correctly is crucial to dopamine production and the dopamine system functioning normally. So, through screwing up the GABA system, so have the dopamine pathways/production been significantly affected.\n\nHowever, concurrent research has shown that, in mice, the effects of chronic exposure of THC in adolescence can be reversed through artificial stimulation of the GABA system, notably through the GABA-A agonist muscimol [source](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912134809.htm). I am going to try to use supplements to increase my natural GABA and dopamine production in an attempt to reverse the symptoms that have plagued me for so long. If this fails, I may have to resort to artificially stimulating my GABA-A receptors - but I hope it doesn't come to that.\n\nI have done some research on increasing natural GABA production so far, and the best thing I've come up with is a combination of B6 vitamins, glutamine, and taurine. This may be incomplete/incorrect as I haven't had time to research it more, but I will continue to look into it more. I will find ways to increase natural dopamine production and try that as well. \n\nI intend for this post to be a warning to young teenagers not to make the mistake I did. I should have been more productive, I should have made better decisions; I am a smart person, but my confidence in my own decision-making skills has been my downfall. \n\nIn addition to acting as a warning, I implore that all who see this to offer any knowledge they may have on the subject of supplements I could use to balance my GABA and dopamine systems - it would be greatly appreciated. On a day-to-day basis, I'm miserable. I have so much trouble just completing daily tasks and I wish nothing more than to be normal again. \n\nThank you for the read.\n\n\nEdit: After much research, I have come up with a complete list of supplements.\nThey include: B vitamins (particularly B6), glutamine, taurine, L-theanine, L-dopa, and L-tyrosine. It is important that all of these be taken together, at least the first three to four. The latter two can be taken independently as they affect primarily dopamine, but the first four taken individually could upset the glutamate/GABA balance.  [This](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.jacobsladdercenter.com/doc/research/other/How-to-Increase-GABA-and-Balance-Glutamate.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwiDnNmLnJXnAhWXB80KHZdFA7MQFjANegQIAxAB&usg=AOvVaw1LppPRUPIHS8YzrYIZ4e-A) is a great resource pertaining to glutamate/GABA balance and is what my list of GABA supplements is based on.\n\nI have also taken the liberty of creating an [Amazon shopping list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3D4DGOSML9SQU?ref_=wl_share) with all the supplements for $50 and some change, if anybody else wants to try it with me.", "author": "Bhamilton0347", "score": 59, "flair": "Harm Reduction", "created": 1579669201.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/es0yjy/why_you_shouldnt_smoke_weed_as_a_kid_adolescent/", "num_comments": 48, "title": "Why You Shouldn't Smoke Weed As a Kid / Adolescent", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"ff757t8": {"score": 23, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/es0yjy/why_you_shouldnt_smoke_weed_as_a_kid_adolescent/ff757t8/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1579670161.0, "body": "Well said.

They have an uncanny ability to warp people, as you said - they can cause permanent psychosis and otherwise fuck your brain up in a hundred different ways. \n\nHowever, you can't say that weed doesn't/can't cause permanent brain damage. It hasn't been scientifically proven in humans, but that doesn't mean it can't. It is unknown, largely due to the lack of research surrounding it because of its illegality around the world. In the studies I cited with mice, those symptoms peristed into adulthood. In addition to that, many sources I've seen have said that chronic exposure to THC during adolescence can cause one to exhibit symptoms very similar to schizophrenia; the dopamine system not functioning correctly is the hallmark of schizophrenia, one that is essentially identical to that caused by weed.\n\nAlso, weed has been linked to a number of other more minor issues.

You're right smack in the center of the age range where mental problems are most likely to present. Constant weed intake dampens your ability to judge what your baseline is. Keep in mind that a significant portion of users start experimenting around your age precisely because they have your exact same shitty symptoms without the drug history to point at. \n\nDefinitely move foward with trying supplements, but don't pretend like you would've absolutely certainly avoided all these setbacks and had a pristine transition into adulthood if it hadn't been for that devil's lettuce. Just because these symptoms feel extreme to you does not inherently mean they had to come from an outside source. Weed can *contribute* to such problems, but unloading the full blame on it with absolute certainty is a serious leap. It's much too common for people smoking a whole lot more than you, for longer than you, to be able to stop with predictable short-term symptoms. If it irreversibly caused your symptoms after 5 years in an average person, there would be hundreds of thousands of people bemoaning their fate and anti-legalization efforts would surely have something of substance to wave around instead of hollow gateway drug/bad message to the children types of arguments.\n\nWhen it comes to something like GABA or dopamine production, remaining in a state where your system is exposed to abnormally low (or high) amounts of a given ligand causes the body to seek homeostasis by adjusting the amount of the relevant receptors until it reaches a sensitivity that's fit for the available volume of the given ligand. Poor GABA production doesn't necessarily indicate poor function of the GABAgeric system as a whole. You would need receptor density data, as well as concrete knowledge of what's average for the species you're evaluating. \n\nBe healthily skeptical of all things, whether it's what you think or what I say.

It makes too much sense and all of my problems have been strongly exacerbated every time I've partaken in it after these problems got bad. I started noticing them long before I quit smoking, and they began growing worse the longer I smoked. If I quit smoking for a day, the problems would subside, but at that point I had no idea how bad they would get. After a time, they became long-term problems and they haven't subsided since.\n\nI see the study that was conducted to be enough evidence to indicate that it is absolutely possible. My symptoms are so close to those which were indicated that I have a hard time believing any differently. Also, the problem isn't smoking weed for an average person, it's doing it as an adolescent. Obviously adults can smoke daily for years with no problems (although plenty adults DO have problems with it), but I don't think the same is true for early adolescents. I was 15 when I started indulging heavily and I believe my age was a significant factor.\n\nI would like my physiological systems to be tested, but I don't see that happening. I'm going to move forward with the supplements and see if they help at all.\n\nI will focus on the future ahead of me. I have a lot going for me, and I have every intention of making use of it. I just hope that my brain doesn't further inhibit me in that. Other people in this thread have implied they believe it's \"all in my head\" or that my symptoms are not concrete, but I must disagree vehemently. I try to be a happy person and as optimistic as possible, and I have a decent amount of success with this, but the state of my brain is truly debilitating. There have been plenty of times where I've contemplated just saying fuck it because of how difficult it is to do anything anymore, and how useless I feel in those moments.

At higher doses it can feel almost intensely emotional but in a good way.  Also a very productive/creative mixture at low doses\n-F-phenmetrazine, opioid/benzo, cannabis (low dose): I like phenmetrazine analogues in general and they go well with cannabis and a little bit of something to quell anxiety.  It keeps you awake during higher doses to experience cannabis' mental craziness.\n-Dxm, Ativan, cannabis: incredibly euphoric\n-Nicotine, amphetamine or Ritalin: Love a ciggy while on stims\n-Kratom, Cannabis: Pure mental calm with a hint of psychedelia.\n-Ketamine/nitrous, cannabis: usually a mind blowing experience that can transport you to another dimension.  This combo is almost like it's own class of drugs.  Absolutely love it.  \n-oxycodone, ritalin: basically a speedball but better considering I prefer Ritalin over coke.\n-Lsd, cannabis, (low doses), nicotine (low doses): a little goes a really long way.  Taking LSD with Cannabis potentiates both drugs but the clarity of the experience seems to go down quick.  But taking nicotine seems to bring back the psychedelic sensory clarity.  Be careful not to take too much as it seems to get unpleasant quick and it seems a lot easier to of on nic.\n-Gabapentin on stim comedown: gabapentin was the best drug I found for stim comedowns of any kind.  Killed them at literally just 300mg which is nowhere near a recreational or impairing dose.  Awesome stuff.\n\nLeast faves:\n-Kratom, nic: unreal nausea and sweats regardless of nic tolerance followed by strong euphoria, but it's not worth it at all...\n-Dxm, Cannabis, Kratom: too much serotonin.  Not pleasant and even potentially dangerous.  Got my heart pumping at 150-180bpm for way too long at a low dxm dose of 120mg, half a j, and 4g of kratom but with very high tolerance.  Kratom affects DXM metabolism in a negative way causing reduced dissociation and increased snri effects.\n-DXM, Ritalin/coke: way too much stimulation\n-psychedelics, alcohol: even at low doses of LSD, it feels harsh on your body and kinda ruins the quality of the trip.  It's just not fun.\n-gabapentin, edibles: overly mentally stimulating and disorienting to the point of nausea.

I'm only turning 20 soon, but have been a quite loyal lurker and a not-so-frequent poster for around 4 years. My interest for drugs started when I was around 15 or 16, it has since stayed a \"hobby\" of mine if you will.\n\nI was most of this time more interested in learning about them than using them myself. I did not use any other drugs than weed, and that was infrequent too, until about 1 year ago I had my first actual breakup from a relationship that left me quite broken and alone with no friends, all of which had recently abandoned me too. Being unemployed/uneducated I started to cope with life by into a daily cannabis smoker, and started dealing drugs for the money and the excitement honestly. Not the brightest idea some would say and I was very aware, just didn't care anymore.\n\nThis past year that I have spent around drugs, I have had some of my best times, and some of my worst times.\n\nI will never forget the first time I did MDMA just driving all alone in the snowy countryside under the oh so beautiful stars and moon, stopping to smoke cigarettes and feeling all of it.\n\nI will never forget the lonely nights smoking weed all day and night laughing away the hours at random Youtube videos and having a blast playing video games.\n\nI will never forget the comfort and peace of my first times using oxycodone.\n\nAnd so many more beautiful nostalgic experiences that I will forever be grateful for. There is also a flip side to this lifestyle, as it comes with the highest highs, it comes with the lowest lows. I have felt such immense anxiety and panic from drugs as I have from realizing who and what I have become.\n\nI have realized that this is not who I want to be for the rest of my life and I must move on from being this persona who I have created around solely drugs. It is not one that I am proud to share with my family, my future friends, my future girlfriends etc. I want to become something I am proud of and can be happy to be, and with drugs in my life it just isn't currently possible for me. I have stopped using all drugs and will not partake for the foreseeable future, possibly apart from festivals and special occasions.\n\nI love this subreddit, all you tweakers, all of you nodders, with no discrimination. You are not lesser people because you use drugs but I hope you can find your peace in life without drugs some day. It is not an easy or glamorous lifestyle by any stretch.\n\nI don't know how to end this post so I'll just leave it here.\n\nPeace out people.", "author": "ProfessionalStorage4", "score": 320, "flair": "Long Post", "created": 1583303547.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/fd2u7h/goodbye_letter_to_rdrugs_3/", "num_comments": 45, "title": "Goodbye letter to r/drugs <3", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fjeneie": {"score": 41, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/fd2u7h/goodbye_letter_to_rdrugs_3/fjeneie/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1583303714.0, "body": "much respect man!", "replies": {"fjeo9fg": {"score": 14, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/fd2u7h/goodbye_letter_to_rdrugs_3/fjeo9fg/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1583304228.0, "body": "Thank you!", "replies": {}}}}, "fjewqlc": {"score": 23, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/fd2u7h/goodbye_letter_to_rdrugs_3/fjewqlc/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1583308442.0, "body": "[deleted]", "replies": {"fjex8nz": {"score": 11, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/fd2u7h/goodbye_letter_to_rdrugs_3/fjex8nz/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1583308706.0, "body": "Means the world to me that I helped you make that choice. 100% hope you stick to it and you will certainly live a more fulfilling life.

I would be surprised if (outside of religious exceptions) there are many people who reach 20 without experimenting, much less 30.

So you stand there, not recognizing it's a problem. I mean, you're not in the water yet, you just can't take your foot out. Until one day you slip, or someone pushes you, or you say fuck it and you jump in. And so you begin sinking, having fully embraced the water. Some people find a bottom; those that do snap to and realize they need get out of the water and go back to the surface. They use the bottom as a push off for the initial momentum they needed to get back to how life was, completely dry. Others just keep sinking until they run out of breath. Usually they recognize what's happening at some point or another, but it's too late as they've already started(or finished) losing their sense of self. And so they waste away, slowly sinking. Some are gone before they even get to the bottom. Most find it, lie down, and accept what they deem to be fate.\n\nDrugs are real tricky. A question should be posed to all those who have yet to use in their lives; would you risk giving yourself a permanent, life-long disease for 6 hours of a massive neurotransmitter flood? Every time you use as a person, you risk waking up an addict just on the other side of the drug which has a singular purpose; to make you use.

Normally when you look at a pattern or maybe even the floor/shadows nothing should be warped or look like it\u2019s trailing off in a pattern. For myself I can\u2019t even see the same and I only did psychedelics at 17-18. I\u2019ve smoked daily and def have hindered my development Bc I wanted a high and to alter my state of mind. Although I haven\u2019t done the things you have and don\u2019t know how addicting it is to chase multiple highs from different new drugs, I say all this to say don\u2019t let yourself spiral down.

If you\u2019re doing these substances at this age, how do you imagine it 3 years from now. Will you continue to chase a high or realize the potential you have. I\u2019m not sure what environment you live in but don\u2019t let your peers guide you to that lifestyle. Influences around you shape you to who you are or will become. You\u2019re still young man you got your whole future ahead of you. Don\u2019t let it slip away from your hands and go down a hole as you get older. One day chasing a high and stimulant won\u2019t cut it anymore. At some point doing all the drugs and getting high gets old. It can lead to life changing effects on the body or even death will be the end of the road. Please man take a look around, see who your friends are think about what theyre about. If they chase drugs to get by then you\u2019ll be in the same boat. I hope you\u2019re strong mentally to get out of the slumps. Ik you\u2019re young and wanna experiment different shit. But doing all those substances and 15 will impact you in ways you don\u2019t even realize. Don\u2019t think it\u2019s too late Bc you can still turn it around.

Not my first choice, but it's societies drug of choice, and I'm actually okay with that. It's a good time until its not though. If done wrong the experience can quickly go from a 7/10 to a 2/10.\n\nWeed: 9/10 - Probably the best drug out there from an objective standpoint. Even compared to a lot more dangerous drugs the high feels pretty fucking good. Also it's super versatile. You can do it everyday, it mixes well (and safely) with pretty much everything else, and its good for sleep as well as energy. Not much to say that hasn't been said. Only problem is the smell, which can be avoided with edibles or a pen.\n\nDXM: 9/10 - Kinda my thing. I'm honestly lost as to why people hate this drug so much. A lot of my favorite drug experiences involved DXM. Probably has my favorite closed eye visuals of any drug. Also the music enhancement is fucking wild. I used to get a lot more bad side effects like nausea, hangovers, itching, etc. but a lot of that stuff has kind of stopped happening after doing it a lot.\n\nMemantine: 5/10 - Interesting thing to try, but ultimately not that great. It's definitely dissociating, but not in a particularly euphoric way. It's almost like being sober, except that everything is kind of confusing and alien. I've never really gotten great visuals from it. The worst part is the 24+ hour duration. It's a decent condiment to drugs like acid, DXM or weed, but ultimately probably not worth it. It does work well for depression in therapeutic doses though.\n\nPhenibut: 6/10 - I have kind of a love/hate relationship with phenibut. To me it feels like if benzos and adderall had a child, which is a fucking awesome feeling. Great for socializing, great for working, great for sleep, great for exercise, great for just chilling. Also a very good condiment type drug. There are a myriad of catches though. It causes tolerance, dependence and hellish withdrawals pretty quickly, it can be hard on the stomach, higher doses can quickly go from euphoric to very shitty, and it always makes me sleep if I'm even slightly tired.LSD: 8/10 - Acid is a classic for a reason. I've done it a lot and had nothing but beautiful experiences, but have yet to have any breakthough life changing moments like I do with DXM. I do think it's changed how I see the world and how I am as a person, but its not like it showed me all the secrets to life or anything.\n\nShrooms: 8/10 - I only did them once, but it was definitely on par with acid. The visuals were definitely a lot more crazy, like, after smoking some weed I could barely see my feet on the ground. I could see them dethroning acid as my favorite psych if I did them some more.\n\nOxycodone, Hydrocodone, Tramadol: 7/10 - It feels so cozy, warm blanket, all your problems melt away, blah blah blah. There's not much to say about opiates really. I like them every once in a while, but they kinda just turn me into a lazy piece of shit. \n\nKratom: 7/10 - Basically a functional opiate. Doesn't feel quite as great, but pairs very nicely with some weed or phenibut. Just generally a lot more versatile than other opiates. \n\nXanax: 4/10 - One of the most overrated drugs imo. It feels good while its happening, but it's not so great when you wake up at 3pm in a puddle of drool with an empty fridge, empty pockets, and no memory of where it all went. It can really bring out the worst in people. \n\nAdderall: 7/10 - Good balance between recreational and functional value on its own, but kinda edgy and uncomfortable and a shitty comedown. I almost exclusively use it with phenibut though, which rounds off some of addys negatives. The combo is 9/10, It makes me feel almost superhuman. \n\nVyvanse: 6/10 - The same drug as adderall, but a lot less recreational. It's better for work imo cause it lasts pretty much all day, but it doesn't have much of the euphoric rushy element that makes addy fun. Also the crash is a lot worse in my opinion since it lasts a really long time.\n\nRitalin: 4/10 - Like addy, but with all the discomfort and dirty tweaky feelings ramped up, a shorter duration and a worse crash. \n\nPEA: 4/10 - What I'd imagine crack is like. It's super intensely speedy for like 15 minutes, then after the comedown I fall asleep pretty much immediately every time. More of an interesting thing to have than something I actually enjoy doing a lot. \n\nCaffeine: 6/10 - Purely functional, but it performs its function very well. Also a good condiment. \n\nNicotine: 5/10 - Pretty fucking lame on its own, but again a good condiment. \n\nNitrous: 6/10 - Like two minutes in psychedelic heaven. The king of condiments. \n\nDPH: 1/10 - Shit tier drug. I have no clue why I thought it'd be a good idea to try tripping on it.\n\nHydroxyzine: 5/10 - Basically like DPH, but better in every way. Also it doesn't cause a nightmare trip if you take too much. \n\nClonidine: 5/10 - Basically a knock out pill. It is pretty intoxicating, but not in a way that's really fun or interesting.

Kinda like an opiate.\n\nShrooms 9/10 Similar to DMT, but lasts longer and kinda refreshes me. \n\nLSD 6/10  Makes me feel like im in another new place, visuals and the whole trippin concept is cool just only worst part is the duration. Thats why I would never use it unless I got myself some Xanax in case things went south as Psychs are never predictable \n\n\nBenzos:\nXanax 10/10 always a life saver\n\nEtizolam 10/10 similar to Xanax \nplus euphoria and less drowsy\n\nKlonopin 10/10 Love the duration, and it feels more functional & less dull than etiz and alprazolam.\n\n\nWeed & Cannabis: 9/10\nLove it and all but hate the addiction or \"dependency\"  that I always fall into plus smoking it daily will ruin your highs till you take a tolerance break or use occasionally.. lmao besides that the duration of it staying in your system is like forever and makes u vulnerable to fail a drug test \n\n\nOpiates:\nHydrocodone: 5/10 not that strong, dunno why people like it. Could be just me.\n\nOxycodone: 7/10 only tried it once and it was a decent mild buzz\n\nTramadol: 5/10 didnt get much from this trash and I heard getting addicted to it is hell and totally doesnt worth it.\n\nTapentadol: 8/10 Just tried it yesterday, its kinda close to tramadol and dph mixed together lmao. Not that good but also not that bad.

Its like a showoff lmao, u get a good energy for like 30-40mins then crash and want to fight with anyone u see + gives u a depression,paranoia, and agitation..! so totally not worth it for me as a downer kinda guy.\n\n \namphs (adderall,vyvanse)\n7/10 Love to take it  here n there but would never take it without having something to shut/kill the energy when needed like Xanax, kratom, DPH, whatever works. m\n\n\nMDMA: 11/10 ooooh boy, yall probably know how it is (; but if you use please consider harm reduction. \n\nOTC:\n\nDXM 1/10 with all due respect to dxm fans but I just never had a single good time on it, tried it multiple times and it always fuck me up straight in a bad way that gives me an ugly look & forces me to sleep it off. \n\n\nDPH 9/10 gotta love the dph, Not speaking of heroic doses but instead mild doses such as 50-75mg mixes very well with xanax,weed, opioids.\n\nEffects I like from it:\n- Sedation\n- music enhancement\n- Longer sexdrive, and in fact just having sex or masturbating on it is a pure bliss. \n\nnegatives of dph?\n- body dysphoria\n- dehydration\n- fogginess \n\nThats why I love mixing it with other stuff to cancel the negatives of it and enjoy the good part of it\n\n \nSEROQUEL: 0/10\nWorst drug Ive ever tried imo, All I got from it was restlessness, RLS, foggy, extreme vivid nightmares lmao\n\nPoppers Rush: 8/10 lol its a tiny mild high but an awesome one imo from time to another\n\n2CB: 10/10 for me, but my friend got agitated because he felt super horny and was like we either fuck some bitches or ill get more aggressive then he became juttery and weird so I helped him with a xan to comedown. Although for me it was incredibly nice. The visuals, everything. Good times.\n\n\nAlcohol 5/10\nSometimes it goes smooth, but its still lame.\n\nCaffeine: 10/10 but mostly depends on the situation and type of Coffee beans. \n\nSSRI's:\nMirtazapine, was soo fucking good on my last flight mixed with Xans .. Its close to a mix between weed & a sleep pill.\n\nValdoxan (agomelatine):\nProbably haven't been approved in the states yet but it numbs all my emotions and get me a restful sleep without thinkin bout why am I still alive lmao.

Maybe there are just fewer lads who are interested in trying 3+ Combos because there\u2018s usually not a lot Information and because they tend to therefore be less predictable and more dangerous than common duos like a Candy Flip, Hippie Flip etc.\n\nHere are the ones I consider my favorites + a brief Description:\n\n- Muscle Relaxant of your Choice (I prefer Soma, Baclofen or Diazepam), Oxycodone (or Tilidine, Hydromorphone), Pregabalin + any Antihistamine for reducing Itching All Dosages made so that they would be equally strong as the others solo.\n\nA feeling of Bliss and deep relaxation, free of thoughts like Meditation + H without Side effects. Watch your Breath and dosages, you might die if you\u2019re dosing wrong. Probably the Unsafest combo I have ever done, but surely one of the best.\n\n- Benzo of Choice (Norflurazepam if possible, Alprazolam works too, dose either 5mg Norfl or 1-2mg Alpraz), Either LSD or Metocin (100-200ug/30mg), Weed (Lots, and lots of Weed), Alcohol (Something around 5 0,33 5% Beers) \n\nProbably the best Combo I have ever done, better than anything i\u2018ve ever done, even mdma or a Hippie Flip at a Psytrance Festival. \n\nIt\u2018s best described like this: As you smoke Weed,  the Psychs suddenly Creep back, as if there had been no Benzos and Alcohol, but suddenly the intense muscle relaxation and overall anxiolytic effects overlap with a wave of Physical Euphoria similar to MDMA, Euphoria like Coke, and then to top it all off. Hallucinations more intense and colorful than the psychs solo, that seem to be heavily interconnected with your thoughts. A rush of laughter, interconnectedness and an amount of joyful anticipation for the rest of the experience yet to be matched.\n\nSounds dumb, I know. Came up with it by accident, we always do Psychs and end the evening with a talk and Benzos, maybe a Beer or something. One day we had a beer to much, took the benzos to end the Psychs prematurely, disinhibition kicked and we decided to smoke some Weed. After 2 Heads of what was maybe 0,4g in total and an unknown amount of Spliffs.\n\nThis actually is something that seems to be reproduceable as long as the order Psychs, Benzos + Alcohol, Weed is maintained. Although my first thoughts where that we had just been Lucky with the combo, Set/Setting etc. \n\nI do recommend this. But please be aware that you might do some really dumb stuff due to the disinhibtion, and that after tripkilling once and going back with weed, there is no more Escape from the Experience, unless you want to do so many benzos that you faint. \n\nCall me unresponsible, or an idiot. It might be true, idk. But the experiences I had with this were awesome, but I would not do it again atm since im not really as adventurous as i used to be with deep dives into consciousness. I really wonder what replacing the benzos with soma would do.\n\nPS: Whoops i got carried away with the memories of the last combo i guess. Good times.

I'm writing a paper on MAT programs and wanted to possibly argue for or against maintenance drugs outside of opioids. \n\nMethadone and buprenorphine work off the same neurotransmitters as short acting opioids like oxycodone and heroin do, however they're not known for causing tolerance and withdrawal after long term maintenance if they're not abused . Yes they will cause a nasty withdrawal syndrome if you quit using them, however if you're taking them daily you can use them long term to essentially reduce cravings and relapse risk. \n\nI'm confused on why diazepam, clonazepam or chlordiazepoxide can't be used long term as a treatment for alcoholism or short acting benzodiazepine addiction. With their long half-life, you'd assume by taking them daily at the same time at a clinic (to avoid abuse and misuse similar to methadone) that you wouldn't have to worry about the withdrawal since youd constantly have the long acting benzodiazepine in your system. Is it because they cause tolerance too quickly and eventually you'd have to take heroic doses to avoid withdrawal and because of that the side effects could become dangerous? Or is there some other reason this is not considered a viable use of these drugs? I'm curious to know your guys' opinion on this. \n\nThe same goes for using amphetamine to treat methamphetamine or cocaine addiction.

I've been checking on you since that post and I'm getting real worried.", "replies": {}}}}, "ebks5k": {"text": "Pretty much the title. I'm curious as to other peoples view on their most recreational/euphoric drugs because it is very subjective and I know you won't necessarily agree with my list, but I'll try to make at it as objectively as possible.\n\nSo, starting from most-least euphoric.\n\n1. GHB\n\nGHB is the single most magical, euphoric recreational entactogen/depressant I've ever taken. It is the purest, most uncut, powerful happiness I have ever experienced let alone could even imagine. It's better than MDMA, 4-FA, slightly better than 2C-B, and far better at clubs or when out with friends than Alcohol or really any drug I've done. GHB doesn't have many flashy attributes. Little body high, no visuals, no psychedelia. However, the mental euphoria, empathy, and love it produces is absolutely unmatched by anything I've done. And yes, GHB is and should be considered an a-typical entactogen just as 2C-B is an a-typical entactogen. The GHB receptor stimulates the release of an IMMENSE amount of Dopamine, Glutamate, and Serotonin while in doses above \\~5g it powerfully agonizes the GABAb receptor, which causes the uneducated stereotype of GHB being solely a sedative.\n\n2. 2C-B/2C-C\n\nPretty self explanatory. Me and a lot of people who take these (primarily 2C-B) claim that it's better than MDMA. Not most, but some. I agree with that sentiment. It reminds me of the perfect mix of mescaline and MDMA, but even better than the imagined combo. It is much more psychedelic than MDMA and much more Entactogenic than Mescaline. It is the perfect entactogen in my eyes.\n\n3. MDMA/MDA\n\nI mean, it's MDMA. Really not much else needs to be said lol. I've done MDMA around 20 times and I've never \"rolled,\" even on 200mg, but it does induce incredibly intense states of euphoria. However, my experiences with MDMA have never been as \"magical\" as with 2C-B or GHB, not even close actually. I was quite disappointed by MDMA the first few times I tried it, but I found my MDMA Niche which is in my apartment, with about 3-5 friends who are *also* on MDMA, just chillin. MDMA is not a good club drug for me and the heat, physical fatigue, and bad comedown are a little too much for me for how little I get from it compared to other entactogens. It's also considerably more expensive than GHB at around $10-20 per pill while GHB is around $20-40 an OUNCE (\\~4-6 experiences vs 1 for about the same price).\n\n4. LSD *or* Nitrous Oxide\n\nNow, I rolled the first time I did LSD. The euphoria was unmatched for a while until I did GHB. It was better than any MDMA trip, but significantly more inconsistent which is why I can't really consider it a better euphoriant than MDMA, GHB, or 2C-B.\n\nAnd I'm not going to say much about Nitrous. It is the cleanest, most euphoric dissociative I've done (I have experience with Ketamine, PCE, PCP, MXE, DXM). Also the music enhancement beats EVERY drug I've EVER done.\n\n5. 4-FA *or* Monthly Opioid Bowel Movement (especially when you suck it back up your ass  over and over again \ud83d\ude29)\n\n4-FA is pretty similar to 2C-B and MDMA for me, but with less interesting going on. It seems like a weaker combination of the 2 in my experience. It is still powerfully fun and euphoric. It is considerably more \"happy-go-lucky\" than MDMA or 2C-B, which feel more calm and serendipitous, but not more than GHB.\n\nHonorable mentions go to 2x snorted 30mg Dextroamphetamine (more of a singular experience, I would put it right under 4-FA), Phenibut, Gabapentin, Mescaline, 2C-E, Hydromorphone, Oxycodone, and DMT.\n\nThis is just my personal list, but idk maybe you'll agree with some of it. <3", "author": "ChrisGjundson", "score": 43, "flair": null, "created": 1576557448.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ebks5k/5_most_euphoric_drugs_ive_done/", "num_comments": 34, "title": "5 Most Euphoric Drugs I've Done", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fb5k0zr": {"score": 42, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/ebks5k/5_most_euphoric_drugs_ive_done/fb5k0zr/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1576557872.0, "body": "[deleted]", "replies": {"fb5kzj6": {"score": 5, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/ebks5k/5_most_euphoric_drugs_ive_done/fb5kzj6/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1576558375.0, "body": "oh shit bro i totally forgot about that my bad", "replies": {"fb62zkk": {"score": 10, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/ebks5k/5_most_euphoric_drugs_ive_done/fb62zkk/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1576568901.0, "body": "how does one forget the reverse boof release? christ OP cmon man", "replies": {}}, "fb5xvu0": {"score": 4, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/ebks5k/5_most_euphoric_drugs_ive_done/fb5xvu0/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1576565375.0, "body": "Lol what", "replies": {"fb5zjnk": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/ebks5k/5_most_euphoric_drugs_ive_done/fb5zjnk/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1576566500.0, "body": "is there an issue?", "replies": {"fb6isyf": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/ebks5k/5_most_euphoric_drugs_ive_done/fb6isyf/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1576580137.0, "body": "Lol, easy tiger", "replies": {}}}}}}}}}}, "fb5m777": {"score": 18, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/ebks5k/5_most_euphoric_drugs_ive_done/fb5m777/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1576558986.0, "body": "I liked G but I wouldn't compare the euphoria to MDMA or LSD.

No other medications were working for my nerve pain. I had smoked weed many times before this but I think my experimenting with those pills really destroyed my \"drugs are bad and scary\" viewpoint.\n\nI'd slowly realize how much of a mood lift it gave me. I found out that my 5mg was a third of what some people get, so why not 3? Then I find out 6 is okay, just not all the time due to the acetaminophen. Then I run out, and I'm googling highs similar to Vicodin. I find kratom. I start taking it every day all day. It was fucking great for a while tbh, low-key nodding off in a warm blanket every night, don't give a damn if you don't believe me.\n\nThen I'm getting deeper and deeper into all the different reddits. I find out I can get high on my gabapentin if I took it the right way. Gabby had to be my favorite of all. Then I ran out and found some on the clear web which still felt risky as fuck considering the package had \"prescription medication\" written all over it. But I had a shit ton.\n\nI'm slowly spiraling deeper mentally over 2 years, kratom keeping me and my grades afloat as it became less sedating and more my 'happy powder'. I have a few hellish experiences with dxm. I'm mixing the Gabby, kratom, whiskey, weed, here and there. Risking a lot to get the weed might I add. Abusing the shit out of the kratom. Fucking around with phenibut. Basically keeping all these things on rotation like a true poly-addict. Even occasionally messing around with dxm still,  even though it was hell every time (speaks to where my head was at).\n\nTaking kratom and Gabby at my old job all the time because I hated it and they hated me and I was trying to cope. It's making me say really stupid shit and making a fool of myself.\n\nI eventually find out my county health department offers mental health services for next to free if you're unemployed (pro tip btw). I try Prozac, Wellbutrin, Lexapro with mild success. I'm getting the typical anhedonia and sexual dysfunction that many experience with SSRIs. I quadrupled my kratom intake while on the SSRIs and still couldn't feel it, but still didn't want to quit it (in hindsight this must've also contributed to the anhedonia). Therapy just felt like we weren't getting anywhere, no plan, just random topics from my past each time, didn't learn anything. In hindsight it was still good to vent to someone. I do remember my back pain (unrelated to the aforementioned nerve pain) miraculously disappearing during this time. I'm not usually the type to believe in hippy dippy shit, but they say chronic pain can be caused by unreleased emotion. Look up a summary of \"Mind-Body Prescription\" if you're curious about the topic. Anyway, gave up the therapy and SSRIs after a few months because there was a point where I watched the footage of that mosque shooting in New Zealand where he streamed it to Facebook, and I felt nothing while it made my friend sick to his stomach.\n\nFast forward 4 years from that Vicodin Rx. I'm now independent and live on my own and have my own career that gives me some fulfillment, simply because it challenges me and I can tell I'm slowly getting better, and I'm contributing to a team. Pretty much clean other than kratom a couple times a week. Still trying to give that up although I wouldn't be where I am without it. Still get urges to go on a bender, and mix kratom with dxm and dph to potentiate it, and lay in bed in the dark and eat a bunch of garbage, just like I used to.

I didn't feel anything from it and thought well I can't understand why people would find this enjoyable, I don't even feel tired, let alone euphoric (I was on a lot of ketamine at the time so that probably had something to do with it).   \n\n\nA few months down the line my 'plug' disappeared, so I went about 2-4 months without touching anything like that again and was still convinced that smoking weed and taking mushrooms was the way forward, it wasn't until I met my friend Martin (we'll go with Martin.. lol) he came to a house we were staying at and he had about 100 boxes of 10mg diazepam, so 280 10mg valiums to be precise. he handed me 5 boxes, I think if I remember correctly I gave him a gram of weed and a gram of ketamine and maybe \u00a310, although I was sceptical as I didn't really enjoy valium when I first tried it, it didn't relieve any anxiety and it didn't make me feel sleepy, not like doing a half gram line of ketamine and falling asleep in complete bliss.   \n\n\nHe recommended me taking a whole strip (14x10mg = 140mg diazepam) I realised at this point, fuck.. you can actually get high as fuck off of this and there isn't really much of a comedown, not like I was used to when taking drugs like MDMA which were way more subtle, the type of drug where I could pop 2-3 and head to Uni and not have to worry about seeming fucked because it was just a general underlying feeling of 'everythings okay, and i'm enjoying the day' I didn't generally consider myself to be 'depressed' or 'anxious' at this time, so it just gave me slight euphoria and allowed me to crack on with my days and get work done, which felt incredible (i've always had concentration issues).  \n\n\nI got through about a box over the course of a week, then over the next week I got through all 4 boxes and realised 'wow' these are amazing. where can I get more - this is where it started to spiral. after about 2 weeks I was getting through 2 boxes a day (56 10mg diazepam tablets) and I thought hey, what's the worst that could happen, after about 3 months of continuing this dreamy like started I veered away from magic mushrooms, LSD, MDMA and other substances and started to focus solely on taking valium, tramadol, morphine ETC..  \n\n\nThen about 5-6 months later after becoming fully dependant on valium, I ran out of money and realised I couldn't get anymore, this was when I realised, you do actually get a comedown from valium, I went from generally not getting anymore anxious than your average person and never really experiencing times of 'depression' to feeling like I wanted to die, I even went as far as to take my own life by jumping from a bridge with about a 300ft drop straight onto rocks, but a guy pulled me back and called the police on me, I was very confused as I was coming down hard off my valium bender. I ran away - obviously, I don't want the police to be involved and to be that cunt who's on 'suicide watch' because there are people out there who are dealing with way worse things than what I am, y'know?  \n\n\nbecause of running out of money and distancing myself from all my friends I realised 'what the fuck was I doing, i'm never taking this shit again' but it was always in the back of my mind, every single day, i'd get stressed and think 'if only i had some valium, or some tramadol or some morphine, this would sort it all out' but I managed to stay strong and stay away from it'. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI spent the next year or so reconnecting with old friends, getting back in touch with myself, smoking weed again and taking psychedelics, although I completely went off Ketamine, Cocaine and MDMA for a couple of years. Then I bumped into a new friend, he was selling valium, and as people say, once an addict - always an addict.   \n\n\nHe asked me to sort him some valium, in exchange for some for myself, I sorted him 1,000 10mg Diazepam and maybe 100-200 2mg Xanax bars, he gave me a couple hundred for sorting him out, in my head I thought i'm going to keep these and not go near them, I'm not going down this same path again, but then one day, I had a really horrible day, everything got on top of me and I emptied a box of diazepam (56 x 10mg) and took them all at once, not in a suicidal way, just purely to black out so I could go to sleep and forget any of this ever happened, i'm sure you can relate.  \n\n\nthen as time went on we started finding newer and cheaper drugs, stuff like oromorph, oxycodone, slow release tramadol (which I would snort) and pretty much any prescription medication that we could find. I felt like I was reasonably sensible about it all, I would take 10-20 valium over the course of the weekend and then go to work on the monday, maybe having a half valium just do deal with the comedowns and felt like I had it under control, as you do..  \n\n\nSkip forward about 3 years later, a few months ago, I took too much, I took about 100 10mg Diazepams, 20 2mg Xanax bars, about half a bottle of jack daniels, and all of the codeine I was prescribed at the time, and honestly I didn't feel that great, my tolerance was so high at this point I could genuinely handle taking that much. But then two days later I ran out of everything and though, meh - i've done this before I can do it again.   \n\n\nWRONG!! - I was in Uni and I don't remember much but next thing I new I was in hospital, I went into respitory depression and had a seizure that lasted about 30 minutes, I hit my head, was bleeding from my ears, mouth, nose and felt really dizzy, I remember waking up in hospital. the doctors told me I was lucky to be alive - obviously my mum found out as there wasn't really any way of explaining it too her that I just 'randomly had a seizure'. I was in hospital all day - and finally got discharged.  \n\n\nI had a conversation with my mum, she said to me 'i'm not stupid, i've seen you in absolute states and I don't know what you're taking but it needs to spot, I hope you ending up in hospital will be a wake up call for you to stop what you're doing. This was two months ago, and I genuinely went a month without doing anything, no smoking weed, no prescriptions drugs, no nothing, not even alcohol. I felt a lot better but after about two weeks the cravings kicked in again, a friend asked me to get him some 2mg xanax bars and said he would give me some for helping him out, i've always struggled with insomnia (getting about 2-5 hours sleep every night but waking up a lot inbetween with cold sweats - even before my drug abuse) so I took them from him happily with a new frame of mind, I don't want to worry my family or end up nearly dying in hospital again. So i'll go easy on them, I probably took half a bar every night just to help me sleep so I could actually be functioning whilst at University, but I wouldn't take them in the day and I wouldn't drink or take anything else whilst taking them, so staying relatively safe.  \n\n\nNow, today - I impulsively bought 20 2mg Xanax bars as my plug has as close to legitimate bars that you can get, they're tested ETC..  \n\n\nI have no intention on being sober this weekend, that's my problem - I hate being sober, i'm still off the weed, which was very hard for me, but i'm certain these 20 bars will be gone by tomorrow evening, and then i'll probably end up buying more and more.   \n\n\nIs it time to admit that i'm an addict, or atleast have an addictive personality, or am I just depressed and in need of some help (I don't get much support from family or friends - they all think i'm stupid for taking it and wont really let me explain the reasons as to why I take them)   \n\n\nI've had 3 xanax bars, a 10mg valium and about half a bottle of Rum, and in my head right now i'm thinking, if I pass out and don't wake up - who cares, it's not going to affect me.  \n\n\nAm I depressed and an addict, or am I just a privaliged white male living in comfortablely in the UK that shouldn't have any reason to be depressed or anxious..?  \n\n\nWould love to know your guys thought as i'm sure you've had similar experiences.", "author": "ZuraBe", "score": 10, "flair": "Long Post", "created": 1573858915.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/dwrxfu/i_thought_me_nearly_dying_and_ended_up_in/", "num_comments": 29, "title": "I thought me nearly dying and ended up in hospital would be a wake up call for my addiction (which i'm still not aware of) but it really hasn't.", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"f7l3v4n": {"score": 7, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/dwrxfu/i_thought_me_nearly_dying_and_ended_up_in/f7l3v4n/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1573861000.0, "body": ">Am I depressed and an addict, or am I just a privaliged white male living in comfortably in the UK that shouldn't have any reason to be depressed or anxious.\n\nThese things don't need to be mutually exclusive, & rebound depression/anxiety would be likely from the amounts you were taking.

With putrid pride in our hearts myself and my South Sudanese half-brother Jawok set out to the park behind a local mosque. Jawok is a bit \"slow\" so he kinda just does what ever I say.  On the way there I met up at lakemba station with my tinder date Yuki from Japan. Everything all the sudden went to shit when we arrived at the park. One of the prayer leaders of the mosque was gardening and he immediately spotted us picking the notoriously psychedelic shrooms. Without thinking and before i even knew what was going on, Jawok just kamikaze charged at the imam. His 7ft frame rained down blow after blow upon this 60 something year old man. I knew that I could have stopped it but I just stayed silent and used the opportunity to take any remaining shrooms before getting the fuck out of there. \n\nYuki and I stopped to take one last look at the damage when we left. The last thing I saw when I looked over my shoulder into the distance, whilst boarding the train was Jawok still just absolutely waling on this guy. It was honestly really scary. It all made me so scared that I was gonna get in trouble that I just gobbled all of the mushies that we had collected at once on the train.

If it wasn\u2019t a school night I would eat the whole box of 16 and smoke a blunt or two on the peak.

My stomach used to feel iron, now my lining is so fucked up I throw up no matter what I take and it\u2019s difficult to keep down anything.

Except mushrooms, I could easily wake up every day and eat a gram and I\u2019d enjoy it and be a nicer person.

Then one day I woke up next to a fucking demon, demanding from me my soul in exchange for just a brief time of serenity.  Turned into a crazy eight year addiction that cost me my love, my friends, multiple vehicles, and my job.\n\nBenzos (Ativan / Valium) - Always suffered anxiety and when I got scripted Ativan it made me into a new person.  I was doing better at my job, I was more confident, and just much happier.  After a couple of months though the lorazepam began to not work so well (who'd of thought it) so I got the dose increased.  Eventually I was put on Valium as well, and that lasted for another year of bliss.  Thought I knew what I was getting into, had heard the horror stories, and I'd recovered from a severe opioid addiction.  I was very wrong.  Cost me another job, and took two years to taper off, two years of w/d's much worse than heroin.\n\nHallucinogens (LSD / MDMA) - These two restored sanity to me after coming off benzos.  MDMA isn't technically a hallucinogen, but candy flips are love and more or less saved my marriage, doing them with the wife, after benzo w/d had torn the relationship to shreds.  Doing these with her brought us back together and rekindled our love and romance.  I doubt we'd have made it without them, certainly wouldn't be as content with life as we are now.  Used sparingly of course, LSD more frequently than candy flips.  DMT also opened my mind.

I was addicted since i was 12 im now 20. Got up to taking 120mg a day. It ruined my life, lost my friends, got expelled in 7th grade for selling, went back to HS then dropped out. Ultimately is the reason for my severe anxiety which is the main reason for dropping out.\n\n Xanax- helped a lot with my severe general/social anxiety and panic attacks but due to the fact that i have no self control, every time id get some i would black out. So even tho i love the feeling and everything about it (besides blacking out) i havent taken a bar in a few months due to the fact that i fuck up n do something dumb everytime i black out, no matter how hard i try to take smaller doses, once i take to much n black out due to redosing i come out of it days later with bo more bars, so cant really enjoy it. Tbh i think it might be because most bars i get are pressed so what makes me black out could easily be flualp or clonazolam which i have no clue of dosing or strength so one time i fucked up and popped 2 bars of clam.\n\nHeroin- my new d.o.c, once my supply for oxy got cutt off i had to figure something out.

Downers are going to tend to be ranked higher because I just like to say fuck it and forget everything. \n\nWeed- 9.5/10. Substance you can use all the time, and nobody can really tell your high. This is when your tolernace is huge like mine. Only reason not a 10 is tolerance. \n\nOxycodone- 10/10. Most euphoric drug I\u2019ve tried, and the best opioid. Be careful, this can be hella addictive. 25mg catches me a nod. Amazing with weed \n\nHydrocodone- 7/10. Like oxy but I say 3 times weaker, and more sedating. Takes like 5 to even feel anything. Not really worth it but still a good drug . Addictive \n\nTramadol- 8/10. This one surprised me, it feels stronger than hydrocodone, and I\u2019m talking like 350mg tram imo would compare to 45mg hydro. Lasts all day and is energizing at the start then you might catch some nods toward the end. Mixes well with weed. Space the doses out, 50mg-100 every 20 minutes \n\nVyvanse- 4.5/10. Makes the day go by fast and the best stim I\u2019ve tried for productivity. Dry mouth is horrible and gives me nausea though. Comedown sucks \n\nFocalin- 6/10. Better than vyvanse, better euphoria but like no focus at all. Comedowns a little bit better \n\nXanax- 9/10. Best recreational benzo imo. Most sedating and best for anxiety I\u2019ve tried. Pop a xan then 25 minutes later go smoke a fat blunt and you are feeling good as fuck. Just doesn\u2019t last long \n\nK Pin- 8/10. Less sedating than Xanax, but around the same euphoria. Good with weed, and lasts a long time \n\nValium- 8/10. Good muscle relaxer and great for just chilling. Can\u2019t go wrong with diazepam. \n\nAtivan- 5/10. Never really got high off this just either put me to sleep if I took a high enough dose or completely wiped out anxiety. \n\nShrooms- 7.5/10. Tripped 3 times on these first time 2g and didn\u2019t really feel anything, next I took 3 grams and tripped pretty nice. Then a week later took 5 grams and didn\u2019t trip. The 3 gram trip was nice though and I wish to do more in the future as it might bump up the rankings. \n\nAcid- 8/10. I\u2019ve had really good times on this drug then really horrible. Set and setting. Euphoria is amazing. Please don\u2019t abuse this drug, major mental issues can happen \n\nDxm- 5/10. Really fucking weird. Made me trip harder than acid ever has, 500mg dxm will make you trip balls. Throwing up sucks though and that\u2019s what happens when you drink the syrup. Dirty high but a nice afterglow for the next couple of days. The only reason this isn\u2019t a 2 or 3 is because the afterglow. \n\nSynthetic weed- 3/10. Was on a bunch of Valium when I smoked this. I mean like a couple pinches of this stuff on some real gas in the gravity bong. Didn\u2019t really feel much but just really high. \n\nAlcohol- 6/10. Have had some fun ass times on this drug. Liquid confidence but tastes absolutely horrible. Rough on the stomach at times. Mixing with benzos can get really fun and crazy.\n\nCocaine- 5/10. Never really felt much. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever tried some good shit. Once I was with my friend and his co worker at subway doing lines but I was on xanax and I swear I couldn\u2019t feel the coke but my friend absolutely did. Wanna try again\n\nPhenibut- 6/10. Helped with anxiety, and made the day go by better. \n\nNicotine- 4/10. Makes me really nauseous and I feel it\u2019s a waste of money. But so is all drugs.

I'm probably the only person in the world who went through  this particular experience (or maybe not?). But I promise it's an interesting/bizzare experience report worth reading.\n\nQuick backstory. Over the past several years I have developed a MAJOR oxycodone  habit. We're talking 350 - 370mg per day, divided into 60-70mg doses  taken every three hours from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to  sleep.\n\nUnfortunately, after years I finally ran into supply issues mainly due  to corona. This meant that I had to cut back SIGNIFICANTLY over the past  week, reducing my daily dose by more than 75%. Obviously, it's been painful, but managable so far.\n\nThat all changed yesterday at night. I knew I had a bunch of Targin  pills (40mg oxy/20mg naloxone) in my posession, but in the past I could  never find a way to take them without giving myself precipitated withdrawal.  I get precipitated WD even if I take 1 uncrushed Targin pill orally! I  guess I'm just way more sensitive to oral naloxone than most people.\n\nBut being in a desparate situation, I decided to try to experiment with  them again. I read online that the melting point of naloxone (when it  turns from solid to liquid) is around 200C while for oxycodone  hydrochloride it's somewhere between 220-270C. So I got a brilliant  idea. What if I set my oven to 210C and put the targin pill inside to  get rid of the naloxone, leaving behind just oxycodone?\n\nI decided to use half of a pill, so around 20mg oxy/10mg naloxone. As  soon as I put the pill in the oven it started to release a liquid and  sizzle. I thought, hey it's actually working! However, after about 2  minutes in the oven the pill turned into this caramel-like stretchy  brown goo which quickly turned hard. It looked weird, but when I  re-weighed the leftover amount the mass of the pill dropped by how much I  would expect it to drop if the naloxone got removed from it.\n\nSo I proceeded to eat (chew into pieces) the resulting hard, brown  caramel-like substance. Some small pieces broke off when I was putting  it on the scale, so to get them into my mouth I pressed my thumb against  the digital scale a few times (this will turn to be significant later)  to get them to stick to my thumb and then I put them in my mouth.\n\nAt that point, I had no idea that I just bought a fast-lane ticket to  hell and had it stamped. At worst I thought I would get a bit of  precipitated withdrawal like before, or it wouldn't do anything. Boy, I  was SO, SO, SO incredibly wrong.\n\nAfter 20 minutes, my stomach begins to hurt and I immediately rush to  the bathroom. I sit down on the toilet and within minutes, something  weird is happening to me. The best way to describe it is as if my blood  was suddenly replaced by ice water. I felt the MOST INTENSE chills and I  started sweating profusely at the same time. I also felt nauseous. But  that was only the beginning of the ride. Next, I feel my mind start to  slip (anyone who has taken large doses of psychadelics knows the feeling  when you suddenly realize that it's starting to kick in).\n\nWithin minutes I'm laying down on my sofa and I am completely losing  touch with reality. I've taken a lot of psychadelics in my life, but  this was something else. I wasn't able to think straight. I would  completely zone out for a few seconds and then come back and wonder if  this was real life or a dream and keep praying for it to stop, asking  myself WTF was happening to me over and over again. There were no  hallucinations or visuals at all, but I was extremely confused and out  of it. It was much closer to a delirium/psychosis than a psychadelic trip. I would compare it to my MXE experience, but while MXE was fun, this was extremely unpleasant and dark.\n\nOn top of that mental terror, I was also experiencing the worst  withdrawal symptoms I have felt in my entire life. My whole body hurt  immensely and it was violently and involuntarily jerking and twisting  into weird and sometimes painful positions non-stop. There was a strange sensation in my mouth and throat as if I was about to throw up, but I  never did, I just kept burping all the time. Of course, all the other typical WD symptoms like sweating, uncontrollable yawning, chills were  present too. But the psychological aspect was by far the worst. It was  like a bad dissociative trip and I seriously thought that I was about to  die at one point.\n\nI couldn't understand what was happening and WHY it was happening - all I  took was some oxy and naloxone! I even contemplated calling the  ambulance at one point, but I could barely operate my phone. It took all  my tripping experience and willpower to remain as calm as possible  given the situation, remain grounded and to not do something stupid, but  I was scared shitless. I was GONE. If anyone walked into my apartment  and saw me they would have called an ambulance immediately (or an exorcist). I could also barely walk, my coordination was completely messed up.\n\nWhile this was happening I ingested 80mg of oxycodone hoping to put a  stop to the nightmare but that barely did anything. I also ate a bunch  of benzos  to try to stop the horrible jerking and body twisting and to calm myself down. These also only helped very little. For two hours I was in absolute agony, delirious, twisting and jerking on the couch, before the  effects finally started to subside and I was able to lay down in bed. I  don't know when I finally fell asleep, but it's been about 6 hours  since the whole experience started and I feel mostly back to normal.\n\nThis wasn't anything like any opiate  withdrawal that I have ever experienced. I have tried taking Targin before (even crushed) and at worst it made me feel shitty for an hour.  But this was literally 100x worse than any opiod withdrawal I have ever experienced. It was a trip. An awful, scary, painful trip that I  wouldn't wish on even the worst criminals. It was pure mental and  physical torture. It was my worst drug  related experience ever by a long shot and I'm an experienced  psychonaut who went through some challenging trips. I'm really  struggling to even put into words how horrifying, painful and scary it was.\n\nSo here is my question - what the fuck happened to me? Is it possible  that me burning the Targin (oxycodone/naloxone) pill in the oven caused  some kind of weird chemical reaction and created a different chemical, psychoactive compound? That seems pretty unlikely right?\n\nThe 2nd theory is that it was all just precipitated opiod withdrawal.  However, I don't think opiod withdrawal (even precipitated) is known to  cause extreme mental symptoms to the point that you are completely out of  touch with reality and unable to do even the most basic tasks? Also, the  body jerks were really intense, not too far off from convulsions. I  never experienced anything even remotely similar to this when WD-ing in  the past. And remember, I only ingested 10mg naloxone orally, which is  not even supposed to be active when taken this way due to very low oral  bioavalability, unless me burning it made it somehow more active?\n\nSo my most likely explanation for what happened is my scale. Remember  how I used my thumb to get small pieces of the burnt pill off of the  scale and into my mouth? I bought the scale a few months ago from some  guy selling it on my local version of Craigslist/Gumtree (he mailed it  to me). It looked completely new and unused in original packaging. But  my most logical explanation is that for whatever reason (maybe malicious, maybe just a mistake), he contaminated the scale with some  kind of a drug with psychadelic/delirious/dissociative effects. There are plenty of compounds out there nowdays that are active at incredibly small doses, so it's possible that I got enough of the drug on my thumb when I pressed against the scale multiple times and put it in my mouth.  But then again, why would someone do that?\n\nEither way, I feel lucky to be alive and I'm really shaken by the experience. Does anyone know what happened to me? Which of the  explanations sounds most likely to you? And if it's explanation 3 - any  ideas what substance it might have been? Keep in mind it must be very  potent in microscopic doses but pretty short acting since I'm back to  normal 6 hours later.", "author": "horriblexperience", "score": 13, "flair": "Long Post", "created": 1588343091.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/gbczyd/scariest_experiece_of_my_life_two_hours_in_hell/", "num_comments": 22, "title": "Scariest experiece of my life - two hours in hell", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fp559gf": {"score": 16, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/gbczyd/scariest_experiece_of_my_life_two_hours_in_hell/fp559gf/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1588345541.0, "body": "[removed]", "replies": {"fp55g0h": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/gbczyd/scariest_experiece_of_my_life_two_hours_in_hell/fp55g0h/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1588345721.0, "body": "I know, hindsight is 20/20.

I've experienced precipitated WD in the past (also when messing with Targin) but it was always pretty mild (involving symptoms that are usually associated with opiod WD) and over in 1 hour. I actually only figured out what happened to me that evening a few days after I wrote the story. I didn't mention this in the story, but after eating that burnt targin tablet and not getting any relief in 20 minutes (I was only getting worse) I decided to snort 20mg of oxy (I never snort my oxy but I was feeling terrible and wanted to get better fast). This was right before the point in the story when it all started to go terribly wrong. I thought that I snorted two 10mg pieces that I had left over from a 40mg oxycodone tablet. However, days later while going through my stash I realized that one of the pieces that I snorted was actually a piece of a Targin tablet, containing at least 5mg of naloxone. \n\nIntanasal naloxone BA is around 50%, so snorting 5mg of naloxone meant that around 2.5mg of naloxone made it into my brain. In addition to that, I must have absorbed another 0.2 - 0.3mg of naloxone from the burnt targin tablet that I ate. So in total, I basically narcan'ed myself with almost 3mg of naloxone on top of already being in pretty bad withdrawal.\n\nThis explains everything, including why this precipitated WD so was much worse than when I took Targin before (I only ever took targin orally). \n\nI'm fine now but I'll never forget that evening. I never thought that opiod WD could cause such incredibly strong mental effects. It was literally like I was tripping. When it was happening, I was 10000% sure that the scale was dirty and that the guy who sold it to me contaminated the scale with some crazy dissociative/deliriant drug on purpose. No other explanation made sense to me given how mentally fucked up I was. It was so intense. \n\nOne specific moment really stands out to me from that evening. I was laying on the couch and at this moment I suddenly realized that I actually exist and that what I'm experiencing is really happening and there is nothing I can do to change that (trapped in my body, like you said). It's so hard to describe, but it was like my consciousness switched off for a while and then switched back on (but I was awake the whole time). It was such a startling realization. Pure existential dread and feeling of helplessness. \n\nIt was a crazy evening for sure. Looking back, I actually find it fascinating that you can trigger such strong effects by simply quickly REMOVING a substance from your receptors, when you normally need to ADD a substance to achieve these types of effects.", "replies": {"fq3fq8j": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/gbczyd/scariest_experiece_of_my_life_two_hours_in_hell/fq3fq8j/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1589094791.0, "body": "Exactly, it\u2019s fascinating that just a little naloxone could cause something so extreme.

Psychadelics can take you so far from your usual mindstate that you start to think that there is no way you're coming back from that.

I had been interested in getting high on something for a month or so. I took one. I laid on their couch for about 30 minutes and i felt warm and cozy. I went over a week later and found oxycodone. I got greedy and grabbed 8 and popped 2. Cozy again. A day before my 16 birthday i smoked weed for the first time. From age 16-17 the only drug i did was smoke weed. It was an every day thing and i saw no problem with it. A few days before the end of 2019 i ran away. A friend picked me up and busts out some cocaine. I felt like the king of the world. New year\u2019s eve i drank half a bottle of jack daniels: tennessee honey. I lost my virginity that night. On the 25th of january i asked a girl to be my girlfriend. She said yes. She was jot into drugs whatsoever so i did everything i could to hide it from her. I tried acid before the month of january was over. I  I did acid 2-3 times before i found ketamine. I was at my other grandparents house and asked if i could have some money to go to a trampoline park. I used that money to buy half a gram of ketamine. I went into a large store similar to walmart and snorted ketamine off the sink. I had no idea how i was getting home. I called up my girlfriend to ask if she could take me back to my grandparents. She came and i felt like such a piece of shit for making her come get me. A few weeks later she saw that i had stolen alcohol from that store because my friend posted it in snapchat. I was on acid at the time she broke up with me. After a week of pleading with her we got back together. I had no intention of changing. I had found some of my dads ambien and took it. I felt like i was in a dream, everything felt good. When covid started to effect my city, i knew it would be harder to get drugs. I found myself looking for OTC medications i could get from a pharmacy. I got addicted to triple c\u2019s for 3-4 months. This is what finally made my girlfriend leave me for good. I was in a dark place for a few months after that. I then got xanax from my ketamine dealer. I took 5 and punched holes straight through my walls and my parents called the cops on me. I screamed at them and the cops. I thought i had hit rock bottom. A few weeks later i went to try shrooms with 3-4 of my friends. It was very intense and it felt like i had gotten possessed. Very silly, i know. I went a month just doing any drug i could get my hands on. I started to steal whipped cream cans to do nitrous from the same store in the beginning. I was doing 10 cans a day for a few weeks. I tried ecstacy and felt amazing. I went back to the grandparents house from the beginning and they had tramadol. Warm, cozy, etc. I got a prescription for hydroxyzine and quickly found out if i take 4-5 it resembles ambien. I tried imodium, warm and cozy again. Couldn\u2019t shit for 5 days after. I got a new prescription for trazodone and found out if i take 3 it feels like i hit a bong. During all of these, i was mixing drugs, doing at least 3 different drugs a day. Currently, i do acid almost every week. I have gotten back into ecstacy. I get drug tested by my parents and i needed to find drugs that wouldn\u2019t stay in my system for long or at all. I turn 18 in 5 days and i don\u2019t know if i can stop all of this. I keep telling myself, \u201cif you aren\u2019t doing the same drug all the time, you aren\u2019t addicted\u201d, but now i know i\u2019m just addicted to being high, on anything. I don\u2019t know why my brain is wired to love altered states of mind, but i can\u2019t seem to go a week without getting fucked up. All of my friends say (jokingly, i think) \u201chow are you not dead\u201d, and i can never give them a real answer. I don\u2019t know how or why i\u2019m still here. My therapist has diagnosed me with bipolar. I don\u2019t know what i would do with my time if i can\u2019t be fucked up. The only thing i look forward to when i turn 18 is i can get the harder drugs prescribed. I have done 17 drugs and i don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to be where my number stops growing. I don\u2019t want to OD. I want to be happy. I know my friends and family care about me and i wish i cared about me. I should\u2019ve died at least 10 times. I try to only do psychedelics now, with the occasional drink on the weekends with my friends. I think i\u2019m starting to get closer to normal. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that i\u2019ll always be known as \u201cthe drug kid\u201d. 17 drugs at age 17. Jesus. I wouldn\u2019t wish this shit on anyone. Drug addiction hurts me and those around me. Of course they make me feel good in the moment but they\u2019re only going to ruin me in the long run.

I plan on using methamphetamine once daily in a pill (00 capsule) weighed out between 30-50mg, depending on how taxing the day may be, to treat ADHD. I have severe ADHD, to the point I was prescribed 54mg of Concerta as a kid, the highest dose available for a child and second highest for an adult. I've also tried Adderall (10mg instant release tablet), partially by itself (about an hour of its effects were felt by themselves, no other substance besides possibly caffeine and nicotine) and partially in tandem with cannabis. I felt it easily, but its effects weren't very prominent. I could focus fairly well, much better than without a stimulant stronger than caffeine, nicotine, and high dose (120mg+) pseudoephedrine, but my mind was still racing, less than normal but not much less, however sitting still was incredibly easy. I didn't feel any forced stimulation, it just felt like my mind and body were behaving as they would on a very good day. Just wanted to get that out there to make it easier to understand the severity of my ADHD and how it reacts to even strong pharmaceutical stimulants.\n\nI'm fairly new to meth, and frankly never even wanted to touch the stuff but couldn't bear how bad my ADHD is getting and being unable to be present mentally for most of my days. However, I've done plenty of research, unfortunately limited to what's available to regular citizens, and will be practicing harm reduction to the fullest. I've only taken it orally once, at around 35 mg, but I didn't feel any sort of high, again just clean focus and plenty of energy. \n\nI do have a family history of addiction and having ADHD am more susceptible to addiction theoretically, but have tried a thienodiazepine (Etizolam), Oxycodone and Morphine (Oxycodone IR, twice at 20mg, Morphine Sulphate, IR, liquid solution, 6 times ranging between 10mg and 60mg), Amphetamine sold as a \"triple stacker\" pill of MDMA (I believe, wasn't tested but felt no entactogenic effects at all, which I figured would be similar to the entactogenic feelings that 2C-B-FLY at 10mg would provide, if not more intense and lovey) at an unknown dosage. None of these substances gave me the urge to redose, none of these substances had a bad comedown, and none of them were particularly enjoyable or gave me the feeling I was high. I also regularly vape 45-50mg nicotine salts daily but have had no withdrawal symptoms from cold turkeying the past couple times I felt like quitting.\n\nThat being said, what would the risk level for addiction be if I took 30-50mg of methamphetamine orally, and occasional vaporizing of 20-40mg of methamphetamine? I'm also roughly 280 pounds. Excuse me for the long post, I'm currently under the effects of about 60mg of vaporized meth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: What would the risk level for addiction to methamphetamine be for me, a roughly 280 pound person, if taken once daily in the morning at doses between 30-50 mg, with the occasional vaporizing of 20-40mg of methamphetamine?

I\u2019m literally always down to smoke some weed. It\u2019s a good, simple, trustworthy drug\n\n2. Fentanyl. I hate to say it, but yeah. Fentanyl was my true love for several years, and I\u2019m still struggling to break up with it. The high was out of this world amazing and euphoric and blissful, but it also damn near destroyed my entire life. Sigh\n\n3. Ambien. I know this is a weird one, but I fucking love ambien. I\u2019ve tripped on it more than a few times, and it\u2019s such a strange but FUN experience\n\n4. Lyrica. Again, I know this is probably not the most common on people\u2019s top five, but I have a lot of fun with Lyrica. It makes me feel dizzy and light when I walk around and I very much enjoy it. Mixing it with Gabapentin is fun too\n\n5. Crystal meth. I only tried crystal meth very recently and while it\u2019s not my favorite, I think it deserves an honorable mention. It\u2019s fun enough, and it\u2019s kinda fun being able to stay up all night \n\nI\u2019ve tried LSD and Shrooms both once, and while it was fun, I don\u2019t think I can adequately place them on this list 1. because it was only the one time and 2. because the psychiatric medication I\u2019m on blocks a lot of the effects of these drugs. I\u2019ve also tried benzos several times but I don\u2019t much like them. They literally just put me to sleep.

Eventually I needed a break from the pain so I took a couple. Was playing cards with friends and within twenty to thirty minutes I began to feel a deep inner peace, some euphoria, no pain, and happy. I left the card game early to lay down since I felt nauseous. What I also liked about tramadol was the duration. Four hours to the peak and four hours of the peak. I used to roll a backwoods and smoke that around two hours in. Worked for over a year and then felt nothing. Took a three month break, took a couple one time, and still felt nothing. Another two to three month break and felt nothing. Not sure why that is.\n\nTemazepam melted my anxiety away, felt euphoric and not sure how to explain the other feelings. And got me to bed quickly.\n\nSeroquel gave me the munchies as if I had smoked herb, took Xanax, drank booze, and had a certain calmness.\n\nClozapine made me sleep a lot and made me numb to emotions which was good for a while since I was going through a lot. That helped me think through things easier.\n\nValium gets rid of anxiety and is subtle and lasts all day. Also works on muscle tension from other meds I'm on and helps with muscle spasms.\n\nDXM is an incredible compound with the opportunity to Heal and Learn.\n\nGabapentin was good at reducing pain and anxiety and also came with some effects similar to smoking herb without the head high, no inhibitions, cognitive and body euphoria.\n\nLyrica helped a lot with pain, had really cool CEV, euphoria, no cares in the world, munchies, but when mixed with alcohol can lead to an OD, blackout, and/or loss of motor function", "replies": {"f9j6fog": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/e58qov/drugs_ive_tried_in_my_lifetime_and_top_5_drug/f9j6fog/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1575386991.0, "body": "I found Lyrica at doses higher than 300mg felt kinda MDMAish.

However I did get a crazy hypnagogia \"nod\"-like feeling whilst falling asleep (felt like my mind was totally disconnected from my body and I was imagining itching myself, then I'd wake up and actually itch myself, weirded out that it didn't actually happen and I dreamed it). \n\nOn top of this for cocaine background, I'm very sure I have undiagnosed ADD. I discovered this because whenever I've done cocaine by itself (no alcohol), I feel absolutely nothing aside from feeling calmed down. In fact, it reduced any anxiety I had, gave me zero paranoia and actually slowed down my rate of speech (I normally talk quite fast and switch from topic to topic fast too.) Practically opposite effects compared to my friends, who would start chatting and get carried away. I deduced this loosely to it's dopamine reuptake inhibitor method of action, just like methylphenidate used in the treatment of ADHD.\n\nSo say for example I snort a finely crushed 20mg oxycodone pill (not a prolonged release or anything), and rail around an 80mg line - would it be safe? For **me** at least?\n\nMy main question though is what **exactly** is so dangerous about the combination aside from taking too much oxycodone because of the cocaine masking it's sedative effects? What medical problems can it cause?\n\nthanks in advance guys", "author": "juststudyingchem", "score": 1, "flair": "Cocaine", "created": 1585464336.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/fquezk/snorting_cocaine_and_oxycodone/", "num_comments": 20, "title": "snorting cocaine and oxycodone", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fls7gdh": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/fquezk/snorting_cocaine_and_oxycodone/fls7gdh/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1585464776.0, "body": "Sounds like you\u2019ve already made up your mind.

Here is a list of (almost) all of the drugs I've done, how I would rate them on a scale of 1-10 and why. Also, just a fair warning before you proceed: a lot of my ratings for each of the following drugs will *most likely* differ from most other people's. Drugs affect everybody differently. These are how I rate all of the drugs I've tried based on how they affect *me.*\n\n# Alcohol\n\n* **Alcohol (5/10)** \\- I was never a fan of alcohol. I think it tastes absolutely terrible and that getting drunk is not worth the physical consequences of drinking. That's really all I have to say about it.\n\n# Cannabinoids\n\n* **Cannabis (2/10)** \\- I'm definitely in the minority with this one. I absolutely despise weed. Now, I have nothing against people who smoke weed, if this stuff floats your boat and is something you enjoy, then, by all means, go for it. But cannabis was never something I enjoyed and I plan to never smoke it again a day in my life. It doesn't even give me anxiety, I just don't like the lethargic feeling produced by a cannabis high. It does not make me happy nor feel good, and I want to stay as far away from this drug as I possibly can from now on. I love drugs, just not this one.\n\n# Stimulants\n\n* **Caffeine (8/10)** \\- I'm rating this drug based on the high it produces, which is a solid eight out of ten for me. Caffeine doesn't really *deserve* that high of a rating though for one simple reason: tolerance. You could never have drank a cup of coffee a day in your life, drink it for five days in a row, and by day six you don't feel a thing. I know caffeine is pretty much *the* most popular drug there is and as a result, gets (ab)used a lot making tolerance seemingly rise quickly, but I don't think that's the case. I think tolerance to caffeine really *does* raise quickly as quickly as it seems to. But the high is nothing short of amazing when it actually does work. *Never* underestimate the power of caffeine.\n* **Cocaine (1/10)** \\- Quite possibly the least psychoactive and worst drug I have ever tried in my life. Maybe I've only ever tried shitty coke, but I've done it about 7 or 8 times and have gotten shitty coke every single time. But even if I got the real deal, I would still imagine that it's not even worth it. Not worth the price, not worth the harm it does to your body, plus it pretty much doesn't mix with *anything.* I would not recommend this at all. Don't waste your money or time. If you're going to buy drugs, there are way better things to spend your money on. Please do yourself a favor and don't waste it on this.\n* **Adderall IR (10/10)** \\- Once again, I feel like I'm kind of in the minority with this one. A lot of people are probably looking at this and wondering what in the world I'm thinking, but hear me out. Adderall is my saving grace. While I live my life often chasing *some* sort of high, buzz or adrenaline, this is by far one of my favorite highs out of all the drugs on this list. It absolutely demolishes any anxiety I have and I barely get a comedown from it. Of all stimulants, this one's crash/comedown impacts me the least. I become productive, confident, get shit done and it makes me not feel worthless. Not to mention it doesn't \"fuck you up\", it just makes you feel even more sober than if you actually were, but in a good way; the type of sober you *wish* you could always be (if that makes sense). There's nothing else in the world that can do what this drug can for me.\n* **\u27a5 Adderall XR (7/10)** \\- Has all the same effects as immediate release, except despite having supposed to last about 12 hours or so, I notice the mental euphoria last *much* less than that but the physical stimulation last much *more* than that. It just feels like an unbalanced high, or like a drug that's \"incomplete\", for lack of a better word.\n* \u27a5 **Vyvanse (9/10)** \\- All the same things as Adderall, as well as balances out the *imbalances* of Adderall XR. I just rate it lower than Adderall because its comedowns are a little bit harsher on me.\n* \u27a5 **Ritalin (6/10)** \\- Think of it like Adderall IR, but *extremely* dumbed down. It's like Adderall's baby cousin in training. Not really worth it. If it's all you can get your hands on though, it'll still satisfy me.\n* \u27a5 **Concerta (7/10)** \\- Concerta has always treated me fairly well. Like Ritalin is a dumbed-down version of Adderall IR though, this is a dumbed-down version of Vyvanse. Only issue I have with it is that I actually experience minor symptoms of psychosis when I come down from it. Haven't touched it since.\n* \u27a5 **Focalin IR & XR (5/10)** \\- Same as the other methylphenidates (Ritalin and Concerta) except tolerance raises fairly quickly and the high is even less noticeable than that of Ritalin or Concerta's.\n* **MDMA (9/10)** \\- The only thing preventing this from being a ten is the [three-month rule](https://rollsafe.org/page/how-often-can-you-take-mdma-molly-ecstasy-and-roll/) and its neurotoxicity. When taken the right way and responsibly, MDMA is relatively harmless, but *can* have some lasting negative consequences when instructions aren't followed properly. I do love it just as much as Adderall though, for sure. I just can't take it as often, whereas I can take Adderall *much* more often, which gives me a high that makes me ecstatic and holds me over until I can take MDMA again, thus MDMA never loses its magic for me.\n\n# Benzodiazepines\n\n* **Xanax (4/10)** \\- Xanax doesn't really do anything to me besides make me woozy. I was never really a fan of it overall and the high is relatively short as well. It doesn't even aid my anxiety at all. I never understood what all the hype was about over this drug.\n* **Klonopin (8/10)** \\- Now *this* is where it's at as far as benzos go, both for recreational and medical use. This is a benzo that not only actually *works,* but when it does, it produces a high that not only reduces my anxiety but also makes me feel like myself again. It really puts into perspective how much my anxiety holds me back. To take this and not experience any anxiety again (like a did years ago) feels so amazing, it makes me feel like I did when I was in my mid-teens (I'm 20 now).\n\n# Opioids\n\n* **Hydrocodone (4/10)** \\- This one is kind of \"eh\". Not really impressed with it. Never made me too euphoric or anything, just made me super tired and just knocked me out for a few hours. Not seeing what the hype is about with this one (if there is any).\n* **Oxycodone (7/10)** \\- But *this one* makes up for it. Having restored my faith in getting a satisfying experience from painkillers, the high this one produces *does* make me a little bit tired, but not tired to the point where I just need to knock out. I'm able to stay awake, ride it out and feel damn good from this stuff. It's no Adderall in my book, but still nice for recreational use, kicking back for the day or treating yourself to a little something.\n\n# Psychedelics\n\n* **LSD (9/10)** \\- This is actually the only psychedelic I've ever tried, though I do want to try psilocybin (mushrooms) as well as DMT at some point in the future, but I will cross that bridge when I come to it. Anyway, LSD, in a nutshell, is essentially like getting a bird's eye view of your mind, thoughts, and inflates your conscience to the extreme. I once had a good trip (the first time I ever took it) and it was by far *the* most blissful, euphoric, positive and uplifting experience of my life. I don't think anything else in the world will ever top that experience except another good trip that's just as good if not better. As a result, having seen the potential this drug has, I give it a nine out of ten, which *would* be a ten out of ten, only I've personally experienced way too many bad, negative, anxiety-filled and traumatizing trips for me to give it that extra point. But then again, of course, I had bad trips for reasons that were *my* fault; not the drug itself's fault. I was taking it in the wrong set and setting and was not spacing out my trips.

I can't remember. anyway, if you're struggling to get sober or have questions, DM me. I have 7 year off the needle. Blessings all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wore the only thing in my room that wasn\u2019t plastered with excrement, a pair of pajama pants completely ripped from the crotch and down the leg, and no underwear. It was cold and the 10 blocks to Safeway were embarrassing while I tried to keep from exposing my private parts on the street. I waited two hours for the money, but when I returned to the Joyce management kicked me out for finding a syringe under my bed and the smell coming out of the trashcan. They seemed to think that I was defecating in it. \n\nThe front desk clerk, an inadequate type with thick-rimmed glasses, a skinny neck and a buzz cut, told me about finding an overdosed body in one of the rooms last week and gave me a pair of jeans that were too small. I bought some animal cookies in the vending machine. The pink and white frosting on them provoked my guts into gurgling while I listened. Perhaps the treat was a bit premature.\n\nFor the next three mornings, I walked to the MAX rail in the dark and took the red line to the Rose Quarter. Being new to Portland, it seemed an amazing place to live. It was progressive and of a size somewhere between a town and a city. It boasted one of the top public transit systems in the nation. Everyone bought their milk and eggs from the farmer\u2019s markets and rode retro fixed-gear bikes with skinny tires and smoked weed wearing hipster glasses. However, cool a place Portland was to live, I still slept outside, and it would never be that cool for me. But at least I was finally fulfilling my promise to my parents about trying to get into the detox.\n\nI slept in an asphalt parking lot with a jacket over my legs through the cold nights. Hooper took me in on the third morning, but the day before that, my arm turned into a thick piece of firewood, hard and swollen. It was excruciating. The ER at Good Samaritan Hospital on 23rd told me it was cellulitis. When I first got there the doctors and nurses sneered at the smell in the room. Fish scales of hardened dead skin covered the soles of my feet from the black and white Adidas I found in San Francisco and had worn for weeks without socks.\n\nThe medical detox at Hooper was easy for me, except that no amount of washing my feet helped. It became an unsettling stench that started light, but the longer I sat in any one place, everyone had to ask, \u201cWhat is that smell? Whoa! What is that?\u201d I watched movies, ate Graham crackers and drank milk, until they gave out the sleeping aid Trazodone at 8 p.m. They put me in a bed next to a guy with teeth like broken glass and ever-present earplugs in his ears, like people do in jails. It made me think he had a condition that caused his brains to leak out of his ears and that the piece of pink foam acted as the drain stop. After seven days I took my last two milligrams of  buprenorphine and left a few days later for a sober living facility called the 8x8.\n\nMen and women who had struggled with addiction or alcoholism lived in the tiny rooms of the 8x8. Each room had a kitchenette and toilet. The city paid our rent as long as we attended five AA meetings a week and stayed sober. I lived on the sixth floor, and all but one girl on the floor had already relapsed. In the lobby, another tenant told me about the Sunday night men\u2019s meeting in the conference room attached to the lobby. She said it was a place where men got real with themselves and serious healing took place. I never went, because I had been sick for so long I didn\u2019t know how or even want to be anything else. Healing scared me. \n\nMy first two weeks there something in my spine hurt like I never hurt before, and I took 24 IBPROFENS every six hours to sleep. My stomach bled inside from the pills, and everyone said that I should go to the ER. I refused to go but moaned and wailed loudly every night in the lobby of the 8x8. The black lady who worked the front desk at night couldn\u2019t stand it or me for that matter. It was easily the worst pain of my entire life, and when my mom came to visit me on Thanksgiving Day, she said,\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s face looks like yours does that doesn\u2019t need to go to the hospital.\u201d\n\nWe took a taxi to Good Samaritan to see what they said. It was my idea that after the CT scan I would go smoke a cigarette, but the doctor said,\n\n\u201cYou have at least two infected discs in your back, and it looks like some vertebral osteomyelitis. That\u2019s infected bone.  We\u2019ll get you up to a room as soon as we can and start a round of antibiotics now. I was going to give you some dilaudid, but  your  mother  says you\u2019re a recovering addict,  so we\u2019ll stick with  Percocet, 10 milligrams every six hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cUm. So, can I go smoke now?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d \n\nI needed a cigarette. Ten milligrams of Percocet every five minutes couldn\u2019t touch my tolerance for the pain. My back hurt, and I thought my mom should have minded her own business.\n\n\u201cWell, Mama, you know what I think, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. What do you think, Riley?\u201d\n\n\u201cF\\*ck this sh\\*t show is what the f\\*ck I think! Just a bunch of stupid mother f\\*ckers around here!\u201d I reminded myself of Turtle Tom. He lived in horrific pain. The doctor shrugged before she walked out of the room. \n\nOn the third floor of the hospital my mom brought me Thai food and several bottles of IBUPROFEN, but the doctors discovered the pills and took them from me. They said 4,800 milligrams every six hours was not good for me, even if it was the only thing that worked. Later that night I chased my mom out of the room, slammed the door and threw my dinner tray on the floor, so the doctors wrote me an order for three milligrams of liquid morphine. It didn\u2019t work, and they seemed surprised I wasn\u2019t more thankful.\n\nThe next afternoon I got an EKG to see if I had vegetative growths on my heart valves, otherwise known as endocarditis. If I did, things were worse than I could imagine, but while the tech and his helper ran a piece of cold metal through the slime on my chest, one of my friends from the 8x8 showed up with some heroin. I demanded to use the bathroom, and after a minute I pulled my friend into the bathroom in front of the technicians and locked the door. We took 15 minutes to fix, so the nurse knocked and made me \u201cCOME OUT OF THERE, NOW!\u201d\n\nAt 1 a.m. a few days later my legs tingled and quit working so well. I couldn\u2019t use the bathroom, so a middle-aged blond woman came in and gave me a catheter. The night doctor ordered another MRI. I could not move my feet an inch by the time they rolled me down the hall. My blood pressure skyrocketed, and in the morning my regular doctors came to see me. The Asian one asked me if I thought four milligrams of dilaudid would be enough, or if I wanted more. To make my point about not drug- seeking I asked for two milligrams, and I cried.\n\nI told the anesthesiologist in the OR that I had never had surgery before. Now they would remove an abscess crushing my spine. \n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ll be fine, sweetie. Can you count from 100 backward for me?\u201d\n\n\u201c100. . . 99 . . . 98 . . . 97. . . 96 . . . \u201d\n\nI woke up to feel the warmth of the fentanyl evaporating and sweaty desperation forming on my brow. There were new pains in my back from where the surgeon HAD laid open the meat and used power tools to cut into my vertebrae and sowed a seam of fishing line through the skin over my spine. A pretty X-ray tech slid a cold metal case behind me shortly after I woke up, and I screamed. Different nurses brought me dilaudid and morphine every few hours. After five days of sleepy agony, I slid out of bed and used my walker and arms to get my first shower, with my mom\u2019s help.\n\nBefore I left a lady used a sonogram to run a thin rubber tube called a PICC line through a vein in my arm into my heart. It was painless, and I was never supposed to mess with it for fear of infection or ITS affecting my heart. A mesh band held the capped nozzle against the skin of my upper arm.\n\nA week after the surgery my mother helped move me into an assisted living facility.\n\nI shuffled with my walker everywhere I went. It took me 15 days to walk unassisted while my toes only tripped me up occasionally. 23 days after surgery I had my first bowel movement and had not gone for several days before the operation. The resident doctor at the retirement home stopped in to see me. He asked me how I was coming off the dilaudid and when my last dose was.\n\n\u201cUm. I think yesterday morning. I think I feel okay. You know? I mean the doctor at the hospital told me that a lot of people think childbirth or kidney stones are the most painful things a person can go through, but she said that\u2019s because epidural abscesses are so rare.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what that\u2019s like, but you say you feel okay for now without the dilaudid?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, Doc. I\u2019m feeling okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Well I\u2019m going to get a drug test from you. Let the nurse know when you are ready to pee.\u201d\n\nThe surprise of a drug test made me paranoid, so I saved some pee in a bottle in case they ever gave me another one. It was more boring and comfortable in the retirement home than on the streets, but it was just as sad. The eerie stink and dread of leather-skinned shadows leaked into the hallway while they waited for death in their rooms. Straight-faced families stared at the floor and sat around the grey skeleton of their grandfather in bed, his mouth open, his eyes absent, a tangle of tubes and wires running from him to softly beeping machines. The swollen-eyed nurses lost two or three patients a week.\n\nThe retirement home wanted to send me home after six weeks of antibiotics, but I wasn\u2019t ready to give up my handy PICC line or hospital bed or cable TV or the morphine I got, so I demanded that they send me back to Good Samaritan for an MRI. The results showed that my spine had only deteriorated since I arrived at the facility, and the doctor wrote me orders for six milligrams of dilaudid every four hours, upped my morphine and added Ativan as needed.\n\nAn old, orange lady who I called Garfield and a young African immigrant took care of my meds, and I kept them under my tongue until I got back to my room, where I administered them to myself through my PICC line. Whenever I took a shower I used a plastic card to try scraping the crocodile skin on the bottoms of my feet from the pair of shoes that made them smell so bad at the detox. At night I snuck out of my window and walked down to a trailer park to buy meth or heroin.\n\nMy nurses all knew I was high but couldn\u2019t figure out how I got it, and the administrators gave me a drug test when the maid found blackened spoons in my bathroom. When they gave me the cup, I used the old urine I saved from before. One of the administrators came to see me the next day.\n\n\u201cSo, Mr. Chapman, when those results come back from the lab, you\u2019ll be out of here.\u201d Her tone conveyed disgust and rejoicing at the prospect of my expulsion. I was on my second round of antibiotics after the first ones didn\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cOkay. Well, aren\u2019t you sending the urine to a lab?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019ll know what\u2019s in my system, right? You\u2019ll be able to know if it was heroin or morphine, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly. We\u2019ll know you were doing heroin and you\u2019ll be gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I won\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you will, and then you\u2019ll probably die of the infection. Do you have anything to say for yourself, after throwing away your life like this?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I do. Get the f\\*ck out of my room and leave me the f\\*ck alone until you have those results! I\u2019m trying to watch my cartoons!\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t have a response, but she left. I got caught smoking cigarettes in my room at night by one of the nursing assistants, but got away with it. Joints were harder to smoke, but I smoked them in the room too. They knew I used my PICC line to inject my painkillers, because it ballooned out where I clogged it and had to be replaced. All but one of the nurses hated my guts and wanted to get rid of me. The one who didn\u2019t hate me spent extra time in my room watching Comedy Central and went to the store to buy me every flavor of Laffy Taffy. She talked to me about sex with her boyfriend and how he didn\u2019t love her like she loved him. When she lingered awkwardly to talk to me other nurses would make up reasons to come into the room and check my charts or IV pump.\n\nBack home my family expected me to die, so my father visited to boost my spirits and maybe spend some of our last time together. I didn\u2019t know that\u2019s what they thought, but my father had concluded from everything he heard that I would be lucky to live. He brought a carnival king cake from New Orleans for the nurses. At Buffalo Wild Wings we split a six-piece of wings and an appetizer of spinach dip, which was different. I always ate a lot of food and quickly, but the regimen of dilaudid and morphine and the hospital bed suppressed my appetite. My stomach had shrunk so that I could barely eat, and my dad attributed my lethargy and lightheadedness to anemia. He made me get my hair cut and beard shaved off. When I got back to the home, an older nurse said, \u201cBoy! You got me all turned on, and I\u2019m black!\u201d\n\nOnce he got back home, he told me over the phone what tests to make the doctors run and what numbers were good or acceptable and what was bad. We paid close attention to my erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which detects inflamation and felt relieved when it went down. My father saved my life for the umpteenth time, and after three months they let me go with an envelope of 12 dilaudid and a few prescriptions to be filled in New Orleans.\n\nI gave the nurses one last headache when I snuck out of the facility with my PICC line in. One nurse wanted to take it out, but I told her the next nurse on shift would. When the next nurse came on I told her the one before had already taken it out, and I left in a hurry. The muscles burned in my atrophied body, and I wheezed all the way to the bus stop. If there was ever an appropriate time to refrain from smoking cigarettes this was it, but I smoked at least three Camel 99s before I made it four blocks to the bus stop. In the airport bathroom, I mixed up 24 milligrams of dilaudid and pushed it down my PICC line, but my body only tingled for a second. Then I felt nothing but sober.\n\nBetween flights my dad called me.\n\n\u201cSeems they have a big brouhaha over at the old folks\u2019 home you were living in.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? How do you know that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, they called us, pretty frantic. Did you get out of there with your PICC line in?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. I still have it in.\u201d\n\n\u201cSh\\*t! Riley!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll take it out myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that. I think that\u2019s dangerous. Let\u2019s figure it out when you get here.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay. Sounds good. We\u2019re about to take off.\u201d I walked to the aircraft\u2019s bathroom, and it moved in my heart and through my chest as I pulled two feet of thin tubing out of my arm. It was probably a biohazard, and I thought about that before disposing of it in the waste bin.\n\nMy luggage got lost, but a man delivered it all by three a.m. There were a few morphine pills in my bags, so I took them as soon as my stuff showed up. In the morning my mom took me to get my dilaudid prescription filled, but since it was from Oregon they would only fill the morphine and Ativan, no dilaudid. I refused to get the morphine filled as some sort of self-destructive protest but insisted on the Ativan. An old roach from one of my parents\u2019 parties gave me a buzz before my sisters took me to eat lunch at Frankie and Johnny\u2019s.\n\nMy sisters kept looking down and putting their hands over their eyes when I talked to the waitress. They said, \u201cCome on, Riley! Stop!\u201d\n\nThey found my attitude and tone appalling. The younger one laughed at the effects of marijuana on my eyes mixed with the onset of severe opiate withdrawal on the rest of my body, slowly turning me into a broken slinky. At the house, my sisters tried to watch \u201cBridesmaids\u201d with me, but I passed out during the part where they got food poisoning.\n\nI woke up in the bed on the third floor, and I thought I must have showered with my clothes on and gotten right into bed at some point in the night and forgotten about it. My sheets were dripping wet. I dreamed of swimming. Streaks of brown lined the white tile in the bathroom by the toilet, but I didn\u2019t remember getting up. I snuck downstairs and stole $14 out of my mom\u2019s purse and her car keys. I guzzled half a bottle of red cough syrup even though I knew it wouldn\u2019t do anything for me.\n\nOver by the graveyards on Adams St. I found a crackhead lady who said she could help me get some heroin for $14. At the Chevron on Willow and Carrollton the crackhead jumped out to see if she could get me some brown for 14 bucks. The guys in the car had some but they wanted $40. She told me to drive to a few other places in \u201cPigeon Town\u201d and jumped out to check at different houses. I swerved to one last house by Leonidas, and while she was in the house my guts shook. My sphincter quivered. An untied leather boot turned itself around inside of me and tried to push itself through my throat before I puked up bile and red cough syrup all over the interior of my mother\u2019s Mercedes Benz. I opened the door and slid out of the vehicle into the street to pull down my pants. An aerosol of liquid sprayed the pavement and the backs of my shoes. A trickle ran down my legs, and before the sun came up my vomit gushed onto the pavement in the middle of the ghetto. This went on for a few minutes before I gave up on the woman coming back and left. She could have the 14 bucks.\n\nI continued to vomit on myself and let my bowels go on the drive home. \u201cI\u2019m going to die. I\u2019m going to die,\u201d I repeated to myself between retching and the expulsion of bile from my mouth. Warm liquid spread across the seat of my pants. \n\nMy father met me at the front door. He knew I had stolen the car and some money, but most of all he knew I was going to die from this sickness if I didn\u2019t get to the hospital. My mother drove, and my father sat with me in the back seat. They wheeled me to the ER, where I talked the doctor into giving me some water. My dad told her not to give me any, and I puked it up like he said I would. Soon I was on the gurney in convulsions, in and out of consciousness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m about to sh\\*t!\u201d I managed to gurgle to my dad and the orderly through the vomit. The orderly and my dad hooked the back of my knees with their arms and pulled me up to slide the bedpan under me.\n\nA doctor came in and belittled me for letting them put me on so much medicine in Portland. I would have cursed him out, but it was too hard to talk and puke and convulse at the same time. He wrote an order for some dilaudid to abate the vomiting and diarrhea until I could get enough fluids to not die. I had only been home for 36 hours, but I had already stolen my mom\u2019s car, 14 bucks from her purse, drunk a half-bottle of cough syrup, puked it up all over the interior of her Mercedes Benz, defecated on the seats, tried to score drugs in the ghetto and was currently puking and pooping to death on a gurney at seven in the morning. This was exactly why I had not been home for the last three years.\n\nWhen I was three years old, they took me off the bottle. My parents had a ceremony for it. They lit them all on fire and let them burn on the levee for me to see. No one ever asked me if I was ready to make that transition, and my time at the nursing home in Portland awoke a latent fantasy to return to that time. Instead of a nipple on my bottle and a liquid diet, I had thick mixtures of painkillers and the nozzle of my PICC line. \n\nI barely got out of bed for three months. Now the dream was over, and it almost killed me. My father kept offering to buy me gum. \n\n\u201cYour mouth is hanging open. Gum will help you keep it closed, strengthen your jaw. You look weak.\u201d And I was. \n\nThey let me out before I ever had a solid stool, which my dad said was wrong, and the following week I went up to Baton Rouge to visit my father\u2019s mother, and saw my mom's dad too, who I called Turkey. I had gotten a hold of some 30-milligram oxycodones. I needed money, so I set up a visit with Turkey. He took me to eat at Popeyes. It had been over three years since I had seen him, since I lived on Octavia and Fountainbleau. His bottom eyelids hung loose from his eyeballs, and he used a cane. He was much older than I had ever known him to be. I asked him for money, and he asked me why I needed it. We both knew I was lying, but he gave me a few bucks before he left.\n\nMy parents could only have me home for a few weeks before they insisted that I enter a year-long rehab called Bridge House. It was free and boasted an extremely high success rate among its graduates. I told my parents that I wasn\u2019t using, even though I would disappear for hours and get caught lying about where I was. My sister caught me bouncing (falling asleep while standing and waking up 40-50 times a minute) one night. Soon after that I shared a needle at one of the gas stations on Claiborne with a random while Seals and Croft played on the radio and beads of sweat rolled down my cheeks. Summer breeze makes me feel fine, blowing through the jasmine in my mind.\n\nI knew I contracted HIV from the needle and went into Bridge House a few days later. In one week I smoked my carton of Camel filters and got caught up in some commotion involving a guy called Long Beach who was threatening to stab another client with a pair of scissors. We took off together. A few days later my mom bought me a ticket back to Portland. I don\u2019t know what they thought I would do there, but at least I would be far away.", "author": "ASavageLost", "score": 35, "flair": null, "created": 1588305311.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/gb2xrv/bad_times_and_picc_lines_in_portland/", "num_comments": 19, "title": "Bad times and PICC lines in Portland.", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fp59o0f": {"score": 4, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/gb2xrv/bad_times_and_picc_lines_in_portland/fp59o0f/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1588350019.0, "body": "Fuck.

I'm considering quitting smoking all together since what happened in the past 2 weeks. \n\nI first fainted 2 weekends ago in my boyfriends bathroom after presumably smoking too much of his THC vape? I got up from bed to go wash my face and as I was standing in front of the mirror, my head started spinning and my ears were ringing, I got really nauseous and sat down for a minute. After I stood up again the same thing happened and I blacked out and fainted and hit my head on the floor - after this I woke up extremely confused and just went to bed still feeling sick and nauseous and fell asleep. \n\nNow this past Friday I had a foot surgery and was prescribed oxycodone for pain, and on Saturday night the pain was unbearable and I was already kinda fucked up from the 2 oxy's I had taken earlier that day. I ate 2 edibles (10mg thc, 30mg CBD each ) and also used a couple sprays of a thc/cdb oil. Then also woke up in the middle of the night and took 1/2 an oxy.  For reference I'm 5'4 123 LBS  so this was wayyy too much of anything  for me. At about 4am I woke up feeling extremely nauseous and hopped to the bathroom where I again passed out sitting on the toilet and woke up not remembering how I got there. It was honestly the worst feeling I had ever felt in my life and I thought I was going to die, I still feel a bit off ever since.\n\nNow I'm scared af to even smoke anything and have just been taking tylenol for pain relief. Has anyone ever experienced this? Does it sound like a panic attack or marijuana overdose maybe? Even though I smoke regularly I still have a very low tolerance for weed which is why I only stick to smoking joints as opposed to edibles/oils/ etc. One joint can last me a week probably.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Smoked too much vape, felt extremely sick and fainted.

It was an insane amount of smoking and over all a pretty good day but I did have a pretty scary experience. We were all in my friends living room passing around 7 2g+ backwoods and I was chillin on a recliner. I had to piss so I went to the bathroom. I was fine walking to the bathroom and what not but in the middle of what seemed to be an hour long piss I got extremely light headed. I could barely get the rest of the piss out before I fainted. Let\u2019s put this in perspective, I\u2019m 6\u20192 190 lbs. I was trying to buckle my pants and I fell, smacked my head against the sink, and was lying on the bathroom floor looking like I had just overdosed on meth. I got back up with my ears ringing and was still extremely fucked up and instead of just sitting on the toilet and chilling for a sec I thought I\u2019d go back out to the living room where I almost fell in the process lol. My friends said I looked pale and my other one gave me a bottle of water (bless their souls) and I continued the smoke sesh being careful and not hitting it too much. But I also have another story. One time when I was with the same friends in a hot box I decided to face my first blunt and by the end of it my heart beat was 120 and I was sitting almost passing out. I thought I was going to die and it was terrifying. Once we all finished which felt like forever I finally got a breath of fresh air and felt 1000 times better. Idk if this time relates to the time I had yesterday but who knows. Another factor that could play into it is that I just bought a dmt pen and finished it off last week. Dmt also made me very light headed.

Vyvanse did give me euphoria the first time I tried it and never again and the same with pressed painkillers and xanax there was literally one time I remember it working and then never again just a waste of money. \n\nI thought it was quality at first so I tried getting trusted ones from the dark web which came in today. I ate one oxycodone pill and snorted 4 and added 2 bars of xanax and some alcohol and nothing. Before you tell me it was stupid I took it slow at first and only when I knew it wasn't gonna work did it take a bunch because I was desperate to know if it was just my body or some kind of tolerance that made me super resistant but that amount should've put anyone in wonderland but I didn't feel so much as a buzz.\n\nI've also taken multiple of pills that I've seen my friend nod out on one without feeling anything so I don't think it's the quality. I've tried trusted dark web coke from multiple sources including one from Columbia and it felt like a caffeine high at most. Molly also doesn't work on me if seems like the only thing that does are psychedelics and dissociatives but my tolerance raises so fast I can only do every now and then. \n\nMaybe I'm lucky I don't feel anything but I just wanna know why. Even kratom gives a better buzz than fentanyl or whatever is in those pills.

I kept mine in for over an hour and felt nothing. \n\nA few other experiments led me to believe I was immune to opiates and I kept this belief for many many years.. I even tried smoking heroin once and didn't feel it (friend did)\n\nFast forward a few years. I'm hooked on meth and a friend has me pick him up some heroin and I tell him I'm immune to opiates. He says BS you just haven't had any good heroin... I tried it and IT WORKED...\n\nI wish I would have kept the belief I was immune and never tried to prove I wasn't..

It's called the safe supply program, and even I got drugs from it just to try the program out. \n\nWe already have some OAT clinics straight up giving addicts heroin injections, Pharm grade, but some addicts have a problem with that the drug needed to be given by nurse, twice daily, at 8 am, noon or 4 pm. Patients are typically authorized 2 doses daily, and the lining up at the clinic twice daily leads to complaints. Eg. How does one hold a job when they need to devote 2 sessions daily 4-8 hours apart inc. commuting and everything else? This limits participants and leads to program drop outs. It seems, some addicts will turn down free pharmacy grade heroin.\n\nIn Canada due to Covid they're doing this safe supply thing. Come positive with any drug in urine and say you're addicted to it. They script you the drug, so you don't have to see a dealer, which helps aid social distancing and spares unnecessary human contact. \n\nIf the drug isnt available in prescription form, they give them similar restricted Rx scheduled meds (what Americans call Controlled meds). Lots of heroin users get at request: hydromorphone, morphine, even fentanyl (patch form only) once blood work shows positive test for opioids and a witnessed test dose of an opioid doesn't induce sedation, extreme intoxication, etc. To indicate extensive tolerance is present. \n\nWished I copped some Demerol when I last saw it being sold on the street - $5 each, but they were selling only due to their fame - I knew l could get a Oxycodone pill for cheaper and feel indistinguishable effects. Imagine testing positive for it plus opioid tolerance, getting scripted ADDICT DOSES of Demerol. \n\nADDICT DOSES. Did I mention the doses are literally 14x 8 mg hydromorphone 3 times daily? Real pain patients take such amounts in a months time (376/mg monthly, or 42 tablets). The fentanyl in the dope has skyrocketed tolerances, so such scripts weren't uncommon. The price of hydromorphone dropped to $1.50 each 8 mg tablet, from a price of $10 each pre-covid. I bought 200x 4 mg hydromorphone from someone for $60 - the prior street price would have been $1000. $60. I popped like 10 at a time every few hours, for a week, which was nice... My methadone drives my tolerance thru the roof. Orally, 30% of the drug gets absorbed, that's the bioavailability. At 10 dollars a pill days, they were for injection or snorting for (60-100%} bioavailability. But at the price I paid I took a huge cut in how much drug worked in lieu of not wanting to spend time crushing and snorting hundreds of tablets\n\nstimulant addicts get Dextroamphetamine or methylphenidate prescriptions. NO pharmacy grade crack or meth yet.\n\nSedative lovers get their benzodiazepines of choice. Now, barbituates are also schedule 3 in Canada - but they are unused nowadays and though a script can be written, no pharmacy will stock your Tuinal or Nembutal the script is written for. You could get butalbital and phenobarbital - just needed to have a tolerance to it and a presence in your urine.\n\nI had phenobarbital on hand from my aunt's script. She got a phenobarbital 40 mg/.6 mg Ergotamine/ .2 mg belladonna alkaloids, script and gave it to me, 100 tablets for her menopausal morning sickness. I had a measurable benzo tolerance due to recent life events (just trying to stay off the meth...). I fuck around and take 10 tablets the day before my appt, and like the barbituate buzz. Hence why I've been saving them. I could stay awake and alert on such doses. PERFECT \n\nSo at my appointment, I told them I am a sedative addict and was trying to get off of temazepam, and was taking 10 tablets a day of this phenobarbital stuff. tried to taper. I produced the bottle, aunt shares my last name, bottle has 2 more refills and I say I've taken all if the first 4 fills. I am awake and fine on the 10 tablets (400 mg isn't much of a dose). The doctor at hospital orders me 3x 300 mg capsules (epilepsy doses) to confirm my GABAergic sedative tolerance. Still quite fine, perhaps my ADHD med (it's stimulant) plus the caffeine I took beforehand helped me. He is suspicious about my amphetamines in my system, but I tell him for the past 8 years I've taken the same med, same dose. Any effect it is having is likely negligible.\n\nI am scripted 8x 300 mg phenobarbital. I got a tapering script for 28 days which reduced by 2 capsules a week, week 1; 1 capsule a week weeks 2-4.  At the end I'm on 3x 300 mg daily.\n\nI get another month script after a urine screen showing no other benzos or sedatives. He switches it to 8x 100 mg capsules, week 1: reduce to 6, week 2: reduce to 4, week 3: reduce to 2. script ends and I haven't experienced withdrawals at all at only 200 mg daily.\n\nLast visit he writes 1x 100 mg for a week, 1x mg 60 mg for a week and 1x 30 mg for a week for the last week. After cessation I feel fine.\n\nFuck I love Canada\n\nIn the meantime the US is still trying to figure out if gabapentin is abusable or not.
