{"h8h30k": {"text": "I didn\u2019t really know where to post this story, but I felt like I had to, and was on drugs for it, so, here goes. \n\nLast night I was chilling with some of my buddies and mutual friends at one of my friends houses. We smoked a couple blunts, and me and one of my buddies split an 8th and smoked all of it with a bowl in &amp;amp;amp;lt;1 hour.  All of us being high as shit, we started a bonfire in the house owners pit and set up a bunch of camping chairs. Then the rest of the guys opened up a case of 30 bud lights. I don\u2019t fuck with alcohol, especially while high off weed, so I popped a bar to stay in a similar headspace to the rest of the guys. \n\nI planned on popping another later that night depending on how I felt and giving the other two I had away (to people who were not drinking of course) or saving them for another day. But of course, in true Xanax fashion, immediately after feeling the first bar I popped the other 3 like candy. \n\nImmediately after taking them the friend who had rolled the blunts previously asked the group if we wanted more. Of course my drooling bartard ass was THRILLED with that idea, so I enthusiastically let out a jumble of words resembling \u201cYES BRO YES DUDE ROLL A FUCKING BLUNT LETS SMOKE SOME FUCKIN WEEEEEEEEEEEED\u201d...\n\nAfter he had walked down to his car we waited by the fire. I was feeling fucking ecstatic and started to notice that my legs had just been made fucking useless, but I was warm as fuck from the fire and comfortable as shit, so I didn\u2019t give two shits. I had just started to nod off in the chair as I heard tires screech to a halt down by the road. The boys got a little started and confused. We then saw a flashlight shine out of the car and completely pin our friend who was rolling the blunt. Then we heard the signature boomer ass cop voice beam out \u201cWHAT ARE YOU BOYS DOIN?!\u201d To our friend. \n\nImmediately my mind started to race. It felt like I took a hit of Coke because I was completely sober out of nowhere. Somehow i was the first to jump out of my chair. One of my closest homies was completely out cold in his chair right next to me, and I knew this man was down for the count whether the cops were coming up or not. So in a wave of adrenaline and empathy I picked up my 200+lbs friend and USAIN BOLTED across my friends yard. I swear to god I have never run faster or more coordinated in my life. I hit the fence at the side of his yard just as a flashlight shined onto my back. I didn\u2019t look back or hesitate at all, and THREW my friend over the fence into the brush. Then I lept over it like a fuckin roo just as the voice yelled \u201cSTOP\u201d behind me. \n\nAs I got over the fence my shirt caught and was completely ripped in half off of my body. I\u2019m a fat fuck, so usually I would not be ok with that, but it was the least of my concerns at the time. I realized though that I couldn\u2019t fucking find my friend. It was pitch black dark and I was submerged in thick brush with thorns and branches restraining my whole body. After a moment of scrambling around feeling the ground in the dark I heard a muffled \u201cbruh\u201d on the ground to my left. I grabbed my friend by the shirt and with the insane adrenaline still pumping through my body I picked him up with one hand and forced my way into the open forest with the other. The tops of the trees were lit white behind me as I ran through the woods carrying my somewhat awake friend. The cop was hot on my ass as I ran past the fence, but upon noticing that the forest ended and I had hit a road, I knew I was safe. I jumped ~15 feet off a stone wall onto  a residential sidewalk and the moment my feet hit the ground I ran like the fucking wind. Still, somehow with my friend in my arms. \n\nAfter this, I have NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED. It was like the moment I had reached relative safety I completely blacked out. Next thing I remember is coming to to a very bright white light. I jumped awake and realized this light was a streetlight, positioned directly above me. I was sitting somewhere. I turned to my left, and there is my drunk ass fucking friend mouth breathing and snoring, completely out cold. We both are just sitting on a bench in the middle of nowhere under a streetlight in the otherwise pitch black darkness. I gotta tell ya, it was definitely one of the weirdest moments of my life. \n\nAs the confusion cleared and the memories came flooding back, I sighed and laid my head back. *was that fucking real?* am I just high as shit and kidnapped my friend? I prayed that was the case, but as I pulled out my phone I was sorely disappointed. I had about a hundred texts. \u201cDude where the fuck are you??!!\u201d \u201c*** got arrested for felony drug possession\u201d \u201cthey breathalyzed us dude, we all blew over and got busted\u201d.\n\nMy friends had all blown over .02 and because none of us were over 21, they were all charged for underage drinking. A lot of them had other drugs, though, and were at the police station as I read this. Probably in jail right now. My buddy next to me was slipping in and out of consciousness. As I started to process the situation he woke up and sloppily yelled directly into my ear \u201cHey dude can we go to Ashley\u2019s house??!!\u201d (Ashley is a girl he\u2019s been fucking) And then passed out immediately after. I couldn\u2019t help it, I just started dying. So there I was, 19 years old, shirtless, covered in blood and thorns sitting next to a completely passed out drunk guy on a bench at 4:48 in the morning, laughing hysterically alone in the dark. \n\nI found out shortly after that after the first car which pulled up that had two police men in it 4 more cars pulled up fully armed and running after us full speed were searching the whole neighborhood for me and my friend. \nI don\u2019t even know how, but apparently I evaded them all. According to my friends the police were extremely annoyed and super frustrated because apparently I wasn\u2019t even close to as coordinated as I thought and they could easily tell that I was fucked up on more than just alcohol AND had brought another completely passed out dude with me. The cop who was chasing me\u2019s partner apparently laughed hysterically when he saw my running, and my friend who saw me said I looked like one of those lizards that runs on top of water speeding the fuck away. The cop who was chasing me was so mad when he came back that he called a K-9 unit and was trying to get dispatch to send a helicopter to look for our dumbasses... Almost everyone else ran but we were the only people who got away, how exactly is a mystery to me. Honestly a big part of me hopes that the first officer had a chest cam because if that footage leaked... that shit would go crazy viral. \n\nThere isn\u2019t really a moral to this story, but I\u2019m literally so shocked and still in such disbelief that I felt like I had to share it and get it all down somewhere.

When you don't run and don't act paranoid, the police are usually willing to let things slide, and give you the benefit of the doubt as long as you can tell a good story. Unless it's super obvious that you have a large amount of course.\n\nGiven that I usually have my cane on me, unless it's a good day, it's a great way to turn their little brains to \"non threat\" I'm not suggesting you could talk your way out of a similar situation with this example, but the police are human beings and a little kindness and a lot of tweaking of the truth can and will get you out a lot of situations with them.\n\nThis is just a paraphrased version of events, I was very high and the cop did have a bit more back and forth with me, but for obvious reasons, I don't remember most of it, just that I didn't get in trouble. The tone was friendly banter rather than me being a suave talker and in retrospect, he probably just let me off because of the effort I put in to bullshitting my way out of it, or maybe he just figured if I can apply myself to not being arrested, I could apply myself to other things in life? I don't know, either way, it was one of the more surreal encounters I've had with the boys in blue  \n\n\ne: I've also been detained on acid and got let off because I had a full break from reality. Apparently I shouted something like \"I don't want to hurt anyone but I'm freaking out, you guys look like demons and I'm pretty sure you're not, but I can't take any chances, so if you're human make a cross sign with your fingers!\" They played along and I turned myself over, because I technically hadn't hurt anyone and was obviously distressed so they took me to hospital rather than jail and decided not to charge me or arrest me, luckily I didn't have anything on me other than what i'd taken, so they'd only have been able to charge me for minor property damage for the hedge I destroyed. Thankfully it was public property and their discretion,  so they let me off. I'd only really snapped a few branches trying to charge through it and squashed a bit of it when I'd fallen as they took me down.  \n\n\nI woke up covered in blood and cuts and bruises and was like \"Oh god I didn't hurt anyone did I\" And they were like \"No just yourself and an innocent hedge, but you've been really pleasant since\" They'd had to call an ambulance to sedate me and apparently I was apologizing to the officers carrying me on the way and to the ambulance staff for the trouble telling them they \"looked like angels now\" And that is why when you buy acid, even if the dealer tells you they're 120's you only take one from the batch first.", "replies": {"fusiz7k": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/h8h30k/ran_from_the_police_with_my_drunk_ass_friend_off/fusiz7k/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1592163089.0, "body": "Are you white?", "replies": {"fvsiglx": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/h8h30k/ran_from_the_police_with_my_drunk_ass_friend_off/fvsiglx/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1592980341.0, "body": "Even better, I'm british.

A few people hate immigrants here too but it's because of the stereotypes that they'll work for less cash, the poor and ignorant people seem to think that it's romanian workers who come to work the fields are the reason they can't get a job in the cities and not the tory suits doing cutbacks to the labour force.   \n\n\nWe have our fair share of problems nowhere's perfect, our police just aren't militarised like in the states so it fixes a lot of the problems with them.

I watched people also end up doing even more insane shit around me honestly. So back when i was just out of high school 05 Benzos were just starting to be a thing or rather folks i knew were just starting to take part. I went to this party that was starting off kind of late afternoon evening or whatever. I took a small handful of peaches and thought that \" i wasnt feeling shit\" so i popped at least 10 Valium tens, the blue joints. Well at this time in my life i held the opinion tha Valium was weak as fuck and that i had to really knock em down in order to compare to xanax. Well like the real genius that i am the only way to really  enjoy myself was to also drink a bunch of Jack before i got to this party. Oh i failed to mention that i was supposed to start a job with my friends family's Crane company. Not operating or anything but starting doing bitch work and what not. Well basically the last thing i remember was actually pulling into the house. \n\nFast-forward to the next morning when i am rudely awakened by some paramedics who were attempting to put me on a stretcher. Now i am confused as a mf because i have zero memory of anything that happed after pulling in. I startled them and they let me stand up. They said that they couldnt wake me up and i was passed out under a pine tree in the yard of my friends grandpa (owned the company). They thought i was dead and they called the ambulance. After i get in touch with the people i was with they tell me that i took a slug of jack then proceeded to throw the 3/4 bottle of jack through my drivers side window and start to mu mumbly talk shit to my other friend and then basically  walking dead after them for a few blocks where they just kind of swiftly walked away. Didnt take long for them to realize that i straight up vanished. Its still a mystery how i wound up across town in that yard. Im pretty fucking lucky. Needless to say that was the beginning of a long and one sided love affair.

He came out of the party and was cussing me out loudly in the street which is why the cops actually got called.\n\nThe cops arrive and I'm like oh shit I'm going to jail. One cop ran my information and he was saying how their computers were slow so I said how the coffee shop I worked at had slow computers too. I ended up not getting breathalyzed and told me if my car was ok to go home. It wasn't drivable because the entire undercarriage was fucked.

I'd love your support if you have anything to donate <3\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/itsyaboylofti/space-cadet\n\nI now have a business that pays me well, a beautiful girlfriend and have found my purpose. I wanted to share my story here to educate people about what can happen if you abuse drugs like I did.\n\nI'm a musician and it's my life's vision to educate young people about the dangers of drugs &amp; how to use them safely. I hate how the industry today glorifies the use of drugs and makes it look 'cool'. It's not fucking cool.\n\n*Anyway...*\n\nHere's my story:\n\nThroughout my life I've always struggled with addiction to alcohol & drugs, but xanax took a hold of me like no other & it destroyed everything in my life.\n\nI used to take 10/day and was pretty high functioning (from what I can remember lol)\n\nI'd wake up surprisingly early for a xanax user (8-10am), take a xanax with my coffee and continue throughout the day until I'd had 10 or more. I don't really remember much of that period of my life... the only thing I know is I took a fuck tonne of drugs, drank loads of alcohol, sipped lean & mixed all this shit with uppers like MDMA, cocaine etc.\n\nNow of course everyday wasn't like that, but I'd definitely do all that shit at least once a week.\n\nWhat did remain consistent, was the xanax & benzo use. I would take any sedative I could get my grubby little hands on. If it was gonna make me feel confident &amp; invincible, I'd have it.\n\nDuring that period of my life, I turned into a bit of a scumbag. I'd shoplift, say horrible things to those closest to me, gamble, sleep around & I'd be out most nights at bars, clubs getting fucked up.\n\nOne night, I came back obviously high as fuck and apparently broke down in front of 3 of my friends, saying I wanted to kill myself and shit like that.\n\nNow I could only ever remember the happy times I had with xanax, never the lows, but that shit me up a bit so I dived into to taking more and more.\n\nAnd weirdly...\n\nThis period of my life, I was functioning. I'd always be up doing stuff, I had a job etc.\n\nBut then the day came when I decided to go cold turkey and boy did the withdrawals commence.\n\n**That week still haunts me to this day.**\n\nI was scared to sleep because of how harrowing the night-time hallucinations were; I'd wake up in cold sweats from the most hyper-realistic dreams and question myself if they were real &amp; could have sworn I predicted situations happening in my dreams that then actually happened the next day.\n\nBasically, in reality, I had no fucking idea what was going on. I was coming to paranoid conclusions about everything and all while it was happening my skin would not stop fucking crawling. (idk if it was psychosis)\n\nIt was **2 4 / 7**\n\nIf anyone has seen trainspotting, the scene where [Renton is getting clean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgPgumQYxUs) & the room gets bigger is the most accurate description I could give of how this felt.\n\nTo cut this part short, it ended up in me having a seizure. I have no recollection of what happened here. My memory is made up from accounts by my friends who said that - my lips went blue, I had shit round my mouth and they thought I was gonna die.\n\nFor whatever reason, something saved me that day.\n\nWhen I came round in the hospital bed, my ex was sitting beside me on the bed and I just fucking broke. I started crying more than I had in years.\n\n(seriously I hadn't cried in about 2 years at this point)\n\nAnd I said to myself I'd never touch them again. I'd never even touch a drug again. I COULDN'T BELIEVE how stupid I had been.\n\nWell...\n\nThat was all bullshit scared talk. About a month later I had started taking benzos again, but it was fine in my head because they weren't xanax... they were weaker valium so ofc it was fine.\n\nThen I started drinking a lot more often and one night (my birthday), I thought \"fuck it, it's my birthday, I'm gonna have some xans\"\n\nThat night I mixed everything, MD, xans, alcohol, coke, pretty sure i drank some lean when I got home as well. We were supposed to meet my favourite DJ that night, but obviously that didn't happen because of the fucking state of me.\n\nI pretty much continued in my old ways for the next year. This time it was less heavy on the benzos, but I still did a FUCK LOAD of them & drank lean.\n\nI was now finding alternatives to xanax. I'd moved onto klonopin, etizolam & atvian. I was obsessed with finding new types of drugs that could make me feel that way, because I was suicidal. It would make me forget & I didn't want to remember how much I'd fucked up my life.\n\nMe and my friends were also running huge rave events at the time that sold out, so drugs started to become free, alcohol started to become free & I dived into all of it head first. The next year was probably one of the most fun & emotional parts of my life.\n\nWe got to play festivals, got booked abroad and all kinds of amazing shit.\n\nBut, there were points on nights out where I'd get black out angry, cry and one time I got kicked out of my own event and started punching shit, wanting to fight anyone and everyone.\n\nAfter absolutely destroying my right hand... (honestly the scab was so fucking big and I'm pretty sure I've done nerve damage) I came to the conclusion that I needed help.\n\nDrugs was an issue, but nowhere near the height of my mental health problems.\n\nOne night I called my parents and I opened up to them about it all. I said I needed help, I couldn't sleep anymore & that I was going to kill myself.\n\n(btw my parents are the nicest, most supportive people ever & I can't thank them enough for reacting how they did)\n\nThe next day I called my NHS GP for an appointment and they prescribed me some shitty anti-depressants and anxiety meds that just made me feel ill, so I pressed for therapy.\n\nLong story short, I was diagnosed with OCD, depression, anxiety and got therapy.\n\nI started attending bi-weekly sessions and did everything she told me.\n\n**AND HOLY FUCK IT WORKED**\n\nDuring this I was still working at my job, battling drug addiction & trying to run events based on a culture built on drugs.\n\nEventually I packed in the events, didn't go out and kept myself to myself.\n\nI started working on myself, replacing negative thoughts with positive thoughts, repeating positive affirmations over and over until I fucking believed them.\n\nAnd that's when I kicked drugs all-together.\n\nI haven't touch xanax in a year or any other benzo &I can fully say I don't get an itch for them anymore. I don't want to have them.\n\nI even recently got prescribed some diazepam for back pain and I haven't gobbed the lot, like I usually would. I used 2 to ease the back pain and didn't touch them again.\n\nI'm honestly the happiest I've ever been! I never would have seen a day where I'd be able to say no to drugs or alcohol and here I am.\n\nIf you asked me a year ago \"where do you think you'll be in a year\", I would have replied \"hopefully dead\". Well I can proudly say that, I'm no longer suicidal & I love life.\n\nI wanted to write this to raise awareness. Whoever is out there struggling with addiction, mental health issues... whatever it is - **you can get better**, you just gotta **ask for help** & really want change in your life.\n\nLife is amazing and it's supposed to be hard. It's the desire to push on through the tough times that makes the good times so beautiful.\n\nAnyway. Thank you for reading my story. I really do appreciate you. If you need help, please reach out to someone. It doesn't have to be family, it could be as simple as calling Samaritans, just do it.\n\nAlso, if you do have anything to spare this month, I urge you to help donate to Action on Addiction & help save someone's life.\n\nI wouldn't be here without it to tell you my story.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nAfter almost losing my life to drugs & alcohol & taking multiple trips to hospital I can now say that I haven't had an issue in a whole year, started my own business & I've got the most amazing girlfriend I could ever ask for.\n\nI've come out the other side and I'm so happy!\n\nTo celebrate I've released an immersive piece of audio to describe my journey & all donations given to this project will go towards Action on Addiction - a charity that helps save lives & people who are in a similar situation to me.\n\nYou can donate at the link here: \n\nhttps://itsyaboylofti.bandcamp.com/releases\n\nIf you need help, please reach out and get it!\n\nEveryone deserves a second chance at life.\n\nI love you.\n\nLofti x\n\nEDIT: Fuck me I never expected this level of upvotes &amp; support!! It really is touching to hear your stories as well. Benzos are no fucking joke and I believe it\u2019s our responsibility as past addicts to educate people who don\u2019t know about them - it could prevent so many bad times.

This is my fourth taper off of benzos, I've taken them on and off for the past 5 or 6 years. It's hard to keep going sometimes - I've been on antidepressants they don't help me at all, despite being recommended to use concurrent alongside a benzo taper. I have pregablin and that helps me sleep on the good days but nothing can on the bad days. Every time I drop my dose I go through the same hell storm of withdrawal symptoms, days without sleep, hearing things and seeing things while my brain creates elaborate paranoid delusions to back them up, I feel like I'm being followed when I'm out, by police or other vehicles or people on the street. Human and animal faces seem threatening and distorted, almost sinister, as if I'm constantly going through a bad mushroom trip. The few days following a dose drop I have an extremely hard time even speaking to people because of all the shit that's happening in the background of my mind. I constantly have suicidal thoughts.

I am currently trying to find a new doctor because the one I've been seeing for years is the one who got me started on benzos and when I first tapered off benzos and had a grand mal seizure he more or less refused to help with the taper. I asked for diazepam instead of the short acting benzos I was on ( clonazepam, lorazepam ) , citing the Ashton manual as my source to back this up. I was left to source my own diazepam and was only given gabapentin to help prevent more seizures. In his defense my medical record is permanently scarred with several substance use disorder diagnoses. I've also looked in to rehab and called a few places near me but it's hard to get a spot, I could only do outpatient since I need to keep working but I will definitely need someone to treat the underlying causes of addiction eventually or I'm just going to repeat this cycle. Of course I couldn't have asked for better timing on a global pandemic and it's much more difficult to see any sort of addiction specialist or psychiatrist to discuss these things now so I've effectively put it on hold and I'm just going to keep on tapering. 14 more agonizing dose drops to go!

Just one slight nitpick. You said that:\n\n> I hate how the industry today glorifies the use of drugs and makes it look 'cool'.

However in the last decade there has been a massive pushback against the sort of lifestyle that those artists pushed. Drugs and mindless sex and partying was THE music topic, but after 10 years of that in 2011 you started to see music push back in the opposite direction. In this decade artists like The Weeknd have risen to prominence, him and many others certainly talk a lot about drugs, but their music tells stories of regret and pain rather than good times. In this same decade Eminem released his album Recovery which again, discussed his drug use in the 2000s, but didn\u2019t glorify it.\n\nYou can draw a direct line between those trends and more recent artists like Juice Wrld and Lil Peep. Their music was all about drugs, but NOT in a positive way. Their music was about the pain of depression and drug addiction.\n\nTheres a huge difference between discussing drug use and glorifying it, and it annoys me how few people see the difference.", "replies": {"g0q849b": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/i5i913/today_i_am_1_year_free_from_xanax/g0q849b/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1596866754.0, "body": "Thank you man I appreciate the time you took to reply and read through. \n\nI agree with you.

Though she regularly used marijuana for medicinal and recreational purposes, her record was clean and most would concur that she was not a \u2018criminal.\u2019\n \nThis all changed on February 22, 2007, when police found 25g of marijuana in her car during a traffic stop and she was put on drug court supervision. A year later while hosting a small party with close friends, police raided her apartment and found a total of 151.7g of marijuana and four ecstasy pills. Because she was the owner of the apartment, all of the seized drugs (even the ones she didn't own) were labeled as her own and, as a result, she was facing significant jail time and criminal distribution charges.\n\nAfter her arrest, police asked her to reveal who she was getting her drugs from, to which she refused. Using her potential prison sentence as leverage, police then persuaded her to assist in a drug sting operation in exchange for reduced charges, to which she agreed. \n\nThis sting operation, organized entirely by the police, involved the purchase of 1,500 ecstasy pills, 2 oz. of cocaine, and two handguns (against department policy) with $13,000 in cash held by Rachel, posing as a street dealer. Not only had Rachel never purchased drugs in this quantity before, she had previously never involved herself with cocaine or firearms. Nevertheless, the operation was approved, and, with grossly insufficient security and very little training, Rachel went to meet the dealers. Due to a technical malfunction, the police lost contact with Rachel while she went to meet the dealers in their stolen car. Tragically, after entering the dealer\u2019s car, she was murdered with the very gun she was ordered to buy. \n\nThis story, while tragic on its own, is one just one of the countless examples of lives destroyed by the war on drugs. Rachel, a young woman with a loving family and friends, was suddenly pulled from her life and, under the threat of imprisonment, pushed into a world of violence and crime which she would likely have never otherwise seen. While this particularly tragic event sparked outrage in the media, it is an outlier in that regard as the vast majority of victims will never have their stories shared. From the desperate families destroyed by heroin and fentanyl because their pain medications were taken away, to the countless teenagers who will forever have their careers limited all because they got caught with a joint, the war on drugs has taken far too many victims.\n \nThrough the continued discussion of this story, I hope that more will realize the true consequences of the war on drugs. If history tells us anything it\u2019s that people are moved by tragedy and so, for those that are still reading, I ask that you not let this story fade into history; it shouldn\u2019t take another Rachel Hoffman for people to want change.\n\nIf you were moved by this story, I invite you to check out the Purple Hatter\u2019s Ball in Florida, an annual festival in her memory: http://www.purplehattersball.com/about/index.html?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app\n\n\nEdit: A friend of Rachel pointed out some errors in the story and I have since made corrections.\n\nEdit2: Thank you for the awards! Though I appreciate it, I ask that anyone else who is considering giving an award to please give that money to a charity of your choosing instead.

He offered to become an informant too and found her someone else to give to the cops and that's where they came up with \"Dre\", a black guy who worked at an auto-detailing shop near campus.  Yes, the cops  were HORRIBLE in how they used her.  But there is a little part of me that thinks if she wasn't more willing to put away an African-American car detailer than a fellow college student who was probably white (just cause white hippie kids usually buy from white hippie kids), then she probably would still be alive. This doesn't let the cops off the hook, but it is a little unsettling to think about these two college students getting together to rat out a working guy whose life they considered worth less than theirs.  Also, a major lack of common sense on her part.  But still, it sucks what happened and cops and drug laws are a major part of why she is dead.

But as we discuss in this thread the issue of how police mishandled this situation in the context of bad drug policy, it is also worth noting the other side of the decision making in the hope that people can not repeat those mistakes either.  Just as there comes a time to move from thoughts and prayers to constructive action after mass shootings, I think that 11 years after Rachel Hoffman's death it is appropriate for drug users to take from it lessons in how to avoid being a pawn in a drug war that includes a racial/class aspect. Just as we recognize that cops and the media value some lives more than others, we should avoid falling into that trap. Her first mistake was being willing to snitch rather than take her lumps. Her second was in not sticking to the script and offering to trade one person's life for another.

We live in a ridiculous outlier anomaly culture where drugs have been demonized.

The Ancient Greeks even ritualized entheogen use in the Eleusinian Mysteries (a psychedelic ritual that Aristophanes, Plato, Aristotle, some Roman emperors, and many other important figures took part in.)\n\nAnyone who supports drug prohibition today, in its current form, is indeed supporting oppression that is in many cases enacted through channels of justice that operate on racist assumptions.

I\u2019m taking a very very difficult AP World History class (that I was forced unfortunately to take) that has the hardest midterms of any class in my school.  Some of my classmates in that class literally studied for hundreds of hours for this test. They even did an all-day study group at one of my friends houses on the Saturday and Sunday before finals week.\n\nI didn\u2019t study for this test at all. I\u2019m super fucking lazy and my grades are pretty shit because of it. That\u2019s part of why this story is so crazy, is because to be honest I\u2019m pretty dumb. This is entirely out of character from me even while sober.\n\nI\u2019m also an amphetamine addict and I smoke hay bales worth of weed every week. \n\nThis week was particularly bad. I\u2019ve since detoxed off of this bender, (and yes, I know I have a problem) but basically I started doing amp on Monday by taking 200mg of Vyvanse. Did well on my exams that day, \nLater that night I was coming down and really jonesing and I had some amp paste that had just dried. So, I started doing lines at like midnight. And for those of you who do amp know, that basically means I\u2019m not going to sleep. I accepted this and just figured I\u2019d get a good night sleep tomorrow. The next morning I took another 200mg Vyvanse but this time I took it at around 11am cuz I had a study hall period in the morning and didn\u2019t have an exam. This is 5-6 hours later than usual. Basically, as you might suspect, I was up the whole night that night from the Vy. And got so bored that I picked up another 8th of amp. I was still high until around 3am and didn\u2019t fall asleep until like 5:30 and only really even was in my bed for 30 minutes of the whole night. \n\nShort story short, this happened two more times and before I knew it it was Friday morning and I had slept maybe 2 hours total the whole week. That morning I wasn\u2019t wired at all and pretty much anhedonic because I had just used so much I think my brain didn\u2019t have much dopamine left (been through this before) so I took the edge off of how shitty I felt by smoking a blunt before heading to school. At this point, my face was sunken, I looked pale, I had barely showered or changed my clothes the whole week, I just looked generally like shit. as I walked into the class I was stoned as shit and the whole class was pissed as they had literally all been waiting for my 5min late ass (only class of like 10-15 people) which was super embarassing in hindsight but in the moment my brain basically wasn\u2019t working so I didn\u2019t care. What happened next is kindof a blur, and the last thing I really remember after this before Monday morning was getting home smoking and passing out and then I slept basically until Monday morning, haha. Detox was fucking horrible and I just figured I must\u2019ve done terribly and got super pissed at myself for having a fucking bender my FINALS WEEK. I went to school feeling like a fucking idiot and realized I had done pretty terribly on most of my exams. When I got to this class though I was really worried cause I didn\u2019t really remember taking the test. Apparently, the test was an essay prompt; which I learned as she (without saying a word to preface) just started reading an essay aloud to us. About halfway through everyone was getting really impressed including myself because this essay sounded like it was written by a god damn poet lauriette. It was smooth, beautifully articulate, and FULL of info from the time period.\n\nAfter she finished the essay, she said \u201cand this essay was (my name)\u2019s.\u201d \n\nMy jaw fucking dropped to the floor, I honestly thought she was joking. \n\n\u201cThis is an amazing essay, I read it to the rest of the social studies board and they were all just amazed. Very good job.\u201d \n\nI was literally frozen in shock. She handed the essay back with a big bright purple 100% at the top. The handwriting was definitely mine but it was fucking HORRIBLE. So bad I\u2019m not really sure how she was even able to read it. \n\nI know this story sounds crazy and bullshit, and frankly, I\u2019m still in disbelief myself. But it\u2019s true.\n\nTL;DR went on a 5 day amph binge with no sleep and got super stoned before an AP World History rest and ended up writing one of the best essays my teacher had ever read from a student\n\nEdit: essay posted in comments", "author": "murules1", "score": 1304, "flair": "Long Post", "created": 1580261242.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ev8h56/wrote_one_of_the_best_exam_essays_my_teachers_had/", "num_comments": 150, "title": "Wrote one of the best exam essays my teachers had ever seen after 5 days of no sleep from an amph binge while super stoned (worth the read)", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"ffu9wvx": {"score": 388, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/ev8h56/wrote_one_of_the_best_exam_essays_my_teachers_had/ffu9wvx/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1580266346.0, "body": "Should post the essay", "replies": {"ffuaneu": {"score": 140, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/ev8h56/wrote_one_of_the_best_exam_essays_my_teachers_had/ffuaneu/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1580266781.0, "body": "I definitely want to read it after all the buildup!", "replies": {"ffukkg9": {"score": 388, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/ev8h56/wrote_one_of_the_best_exam_essays_my_teachers_had/ffukkg9/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1580272713.0, "body": "Preface: We had 10 minutes planning time and 30 minutes to write. I know it\u2019s no college thesis but I think for being a dumbass high schooler with a time constraint it\u2019s pretty good. We had no idea what each of our prompts would be about, only that it would be about something after the year change (0AD). Also sorry about the weird formatting I\u2019m on mobile and don\u2019t know how to change it\n\nThe prompt: Explain the relationship between the early imperial United States and Europe, and how the manifest destiny movements led to 20th century American imperialism. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n          The booming movement of American imperialism in the late 1800\u2019s pushed Americans into untouched lands for many reasons fundamental in the nations newfound stability and success. This movement was largely influenced by European colonial practices, as well, though. And the sequence of events which led to the genesis of this American attitude is surprisingly explicably comprehensible. \n       Americans had long been isolationists, and most of the time kept out of European affairs; for example, there was overwhelming diplomatic apathy from the US during the French Revolution. Public opinion was strongly against supporting the French movement, and subsequently the US Govt. acted only to preserve their commercial relationship with France, Spain, and Britain. \n        US commercial neutrality was soon threatened by Britain, who began to impress thousands of US merchants and sailors by the turn of the 20th century. This triggered the war of 1812, which only worsened the US\u2019s relationship with European powers (France and Spain due to declined levy requests). \n        As the US began to look less toward Europe for economic stability, it looked toward the frontier to supplement its growth. By this time, the US was experiencing the largest immigration boom of all time. Millions of immigrants from Europe, Africa, and Asia began to come through ports like Ellis and Angel island, willingly, or often otherwise, unfortunately. This not only kickstarted American industrialization and urbanization, but also led to booms in American agriculture, manufacturing, public transportation, arts, and science. This made Americans motivated, more than ever, to push the frontier west, searching for new economic, agricultural, and social opportunity. \n     As America moved west, it\u2019s identify formed adjacent to its process and means of expansion. Addressing the issue of the legality of slavery was procrastinated with the Missouri compromise. The Gadsden and Louisiana purchases, and other land grabs secured our isolation from European influence in North America and developed new territory for slave and business owners. Native Americans were slaughtered, often inadvertently, or forced to move west (Like the trail of tears). The perceived American prerogative of claiming new territory was known to its supporters and cultivators as Manifest Destiny. And their destiny was enacted as the frontier ended in 1890 and the entire present day contiguous United States had been claimed. Behind our fast moving border, left a legacy of tyranny, blood, and theft. \nAnd Native American populations subsequently dwindled. \n       The practices used by Americans during the time of Manifest Destiny continued into the following generation. A new, massive populous had unmatched political and economic demand. This, once again, pushed America into new territory. Alaska was purchased from Russia in 1867, for ~$7 million. This began a long and ongoing American legacy in the pacific. Hawaii, Guam, The Philippines, and American Samoa were the next to be claimed. In Hawaii, Queen Liluokalani was forced to abdicate by American sugar businesses. Americans also disrupted Japanese isolationist policy to force trade onto them. These events reflect the events of the previous movement, where American business, motivated by massive demand, practically stole territory from established civilizations. On the east, war was waged against Spain for control of Cuba. The catalyst being the supposed Spanish sinking of the USS Maine. \n       In all occupied territory, the people suffered. Suffered at the hand of an unaware tyrannical oligarchy.

Otherwise pretty good. You can outright remove a few \"And\"s from the start of sentences and shorten the origenal thesis inorder to structure the next 3 paragraphs to have more tact. You can expand on what's left in a compare/contrast way on how other nations did not see the same stability and success due to their lack of mercantilism. \n\nI wrote scientific papers mostly which are entirely different but the skill of distilling information helps considerably. \n\nA suggestion I can give would be to use your vyvanse better. Your having to give yourself brain damage to achieve an effective dose. Only take it during studying and to make it a ritual. My effective dose is around 70mg a day. If I double it to 140mg, my tolerance goes through the roof.\n\nMy ritual in university was to eat a dry bagel, black coffee and 50mg of vyvanse while organizing what I was going to do that day. Then I would do a light workout, shower and go to the library and study for 2 hours before class. I ended up getting Dean's list with a greater than 4.0 average for 2 years. \n\nI was a shithead in high school that barely got C's. My suggestion with pot is to only smoke on fridays, this will save you a ton of money because your tolerance will be low and the headfog is eliminated by monday. \n\nI'd also suggest maybe switching to ritalin for situations where you dont need to interact with people very much. I could visually imagine the works in my text much better in my thoughts. Amp has a choas effect like caffeine. Also my caffeine intake was around 300-400mg a day on vyvanse where on ritalin, anything over 100mg would be uncomfortable. \n\nJust dont end up like me where I compensate my grind with Dex, energy drinks, edibles every night with sleeping pills then drink myself to oblivion on weekends. When I hit the books every time I need upgrading I immediately get sick, it takes a couple weeks of readjustment and vivid nightmares from lack of THC and sleeping pills. \n\nI'm 27 and still a bit of a mess but have been quite successful, dont let your substances do you in and never think your unable to learn something. I actually enjoy the process of figuring out a problem or coming up with a weird way of memorizing information.\n\nGroup studying should be a max of 3 people.

As an example I let it complete a text with the first sentence of your essay:\n\n\nThe booming movement of American imperialism in the late 1800\u2019s pushed Americans into untouched lands for many reasons fundamental in the nations newfound stability and success.\u00a0The incursions were mostly undertaken to enhance US goods through the sale of mining and land concessions. As the two colonies became inseparable economic allies in the region, so too did they facilitate the maturation of their two forms of mass production. The Michigan economy depended upon cotton and tobacco cultivation to support it's farming industry and the area already had the infrastructure in place to produce this basic element. The fact that the territory would follow the same path of US industrialization as it's city-states outside the new republic helped to build a strong bond between the two.\n\n\nNow keep in mind, this is all newly written text by a computer program. It's not copy paste and it's not written by a human, so it should be save for any kind of homework.

This allows you to get a feel for how the substance is potentiated and reduces the possibility of overdose\n\nPOTENTIATION IS BEST USED ONLY OCCASIONALLY. Chronic potentiation can result in significant diminished returns and potentiators can alter other substances one takes as well. I do not advise chronic daily potentiation of substances aside from something like magnesium or similar substances.\n\nNote on agmatine: Agmatine is very finicky, I suggest only using occasionally as it effects a very wide range of receptors. Many report increased euphoria from many substances when using agmatine, while many report agmatine dulls the euphoria of some substances\n\nLSD/LSA potentiation:\n- Coluracetam: strong potentiator of lysergamides, coluracetam appears to have potentiation effects on psychs and dissos comparable to that of noopept, which suggests (along with the fact that coluracetam increases acetylcholine production) that coluracetam may be more similar to noopept than any racetams\n- Piracetam: potentiates LSD by about 1.5 times\n- Fasoracetam: minimal testing done on this combo but it appears to potentiate lsd by about 2 times\n- Huperzine A, CDP choline, Alpha GPC: make the experience feel more magical and enhances thought processing and visuals\n- note: Aniracetam appears to be the one racetam that significantly dulls psychedelics (possibly due to decreasing 5HT2a binding affinity)\u00a0\n\n\nAmphetamine potentiation:\n- 1/4 tsp baking soda or tums 0-30 minutes before dosing (acidity increases excretion of amphetamines and decreases length of high as well as worsens comedown)\n- Agmatine: potentiates the euphoria and overall experience; noticeably increases length of beneficial effects for me (*Dose low on the agmatine: 250-500 mg; more can dull euphoria)\n- low dose memantine (5-20 mg)\n- low dose dxm (30-60 mg; more is hard on the heart)\u00a0\n- Turmeric w black pepper/piperine: increase euphoria and smoothen out the experience; decreases comedown\n- Magnesium: Mild NMDA antagonist; helps lessen tolerance buildup as well as reduces bruxism\n- NAC (low dose only; 400-600 mg before and redose when comedown becomes uncomfortable): NAC aids in reducing dopamine depletion from amps and reduces the comedown significantly for me\n- Huperzine A: Increased euphoria and cognitive effects, brings back the magic for me. Very good to mix for a study session\n- Yerba mate: Mild MAOI; noticeably enhances effects and feels much better than other forms of caffeine on amp\n- Other sources of caffeine\n- Racetams: unpredictable potentiation, can cause anger or too much stimulation for some. Mixing racetams and amphetamines could also potentially cause glutamate excitoxicty, so i dont recommend mixing them (if you do mix them, take creatine and/or low dose memantine with it because both aid with glutamate excitoxicity. note: creatine is more effective for reducing glutamate excitoxicity). Fasoracetam and coluracetam enhance amphetamine the best ime\n\nOpiate potentiation:\n- Quercetin (250-500 mg 30-60 min before dosing. *Use caution when mixing quercetin with opis as there is evidence to suggest quercetin is effective at reversing opi tolerance\n- 30-60 mg DXM 30-60 minutes before dosing\n- 5-20 mg memantine 3-4 hrs before dosing\n- 25-50 mg DPH, hydroxyzine, or promethazine 30-60 minutes before dosing\n- Agmatine:\u00a0 potentiates the pain relieving qualities and increases length of substance (*Dose low on the agmatine: 250-500 mg; more can dull euphoria)\n- Tagamet/cimetidine 30-60 minutes before dosing, inhibits liver enzymes\n- Grapefruit juice or grapefruit seed extract for liver enzyme inhibition\n- Turmeric with black pepper: enzyme inhibition \n- Blackseed oil or extract: enhances euphoria, length, anxiolysis and analgesia\n- For fat soluble opis (kratom, hydrocodone, codeine, tramadol): fatty snack or drink 20-30 minutes after dosing\n*Tramadol: Start with either 50 or 100 mg, and redose 50 mg every 30 minutes after initial dose for maximum high, fatty snack 20-30 minutes after first tramadol dose here helps tremendously with the increase in absorption. Stagger 50 mg redoses every 30 minutes up to 300 mg tramadol total.\n\nDXM and possibly other NMDA antagonist potentiation:\n- Blackseed extract or oil: Strong potentiator of all aspects of DXM ime, enhanced anxiolysis as well\n- White grapefruit juice or grapefruit seed extract for liver enzyme inhibition\u00a0\n- Cannabis \n- Lysine (amino acid): appears to potentiate DXM anecdotally and subjectively; possibly due to lysine\u2019s 5HT4 antagonism. Lysine increases the dissociation and euphoria significantly for me, id highly suggest the combo due to how cheap lysine is in powder form. Its possible i experienced potentiation of memantine from lysine but i havent gotten to trial that again.\n- Turmeric with black pepper/piperine: increases euphoria and warmth a large amount\n- Noopept: increases DXM visuals and improves cognition while on DXM and allows for increased trip memory retainment (5-15 mg is sufficient)\n- Coluracetam: Increases DXM visuals a lot and enhances antidepressant effects as well as improving trip memory retainment (10-20 mg is a good dose)\n- 25-100 mg DPH for liver enzyme inhibition and visual potentiation (can make DXM feel too dirty for some)\u00a0\n- Yerba Mate\n\nCannabis potentiation:\n- Turmeric with black pepper/piperine: consume 30+ minutes before cannabis\n- External sources of terpenes from plants and herbs (lemongrass for myrcene, thyme for thymol)\n- Anandamide containing substances such as cacao\n- External sources of cannabinoids including nutmeg, kava, dark chocolate, and ceylon cinnamon\n\nBenzos:\n- Turmeric with black pepper/piperine: Enhances anxiolysis and\u00a0\n- Blackseed extract or oil: Increases overall effects and length. Enhances anxiolysis and provides some euphoria\n- Lemon balm or ashwagandha: GABAergic herbal adaptogens that improve the overall experience and increase euphoria and anxiolysis\n- Kava: Gabaergic\n\u00a0- Agmatine: Enhances anxiolysis and increases length (dose low: 250 mg should be enough, more may decrease desired effects)\n\nPhenibut and gabapentin (possibly pregablin/lyrica as well):\n- Agmatine: Enhances anxiety relief and euphoria (low dose only; 250-500 mg is all you need)\n- NAC (N-acetyl cysteine): Enhances anxiety relief and body high/warmth, strong potentiator for me (only use 400-600 mg for potentiation). NAC modulates glutamate and dopamine\n- Acidic substances consumed while dosing (coffee, lemon/lime jucie in water, etc)\n- Fatty snack consumed 15-30 minutes after dosing (only for gabap or pregab, not phenibut)\n- Staggering doses appears to increse the efffects of both of these substances; split phenibut dose in half and dose each half with on hour seperating the doses. Stagger gabapentin in 300-600 mg intervals each 30 minutes for best results (increases bioavailability)", "author": "Sohrey", "score": 160, "flair": "I :love: Drugs", "created": 1593738579.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hk0yiv/the_ultimate_drug_potentiation_guide_updated/", "num_comments": 83, "title": "The ultimate drug potentiation guide [Updated]", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fwq05fb": {"score": 59, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/hk0yiv/the_ultimate_drug_potentiation_guide_updated/fwq05fb/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1593742133.0, "body": "Mangos for weed (myrcine)", "replies": {"fwrdqv1": {"score": 4, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/hk0yiv/the_ultimate_drug_potentiation_guide_updated/fwrdqv1/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1593767927.0, "body": "I'm fairly certain that is mostly a myth.

Friend 2 is also the kinda guy that does shit for himself, with no real need to tell others what he\u2019s doing, a real go-getter. Anyway, at this point I\u2019m telling friend 1 to stop talking like that because he\u2019s ruining it for friend 2. He says something not mean but just kinda what you\u2019d say if you were tripping and muttered \u201caren\u2019t you just a cog in the machine\u201d or something along those lines. Anyway before he could apologize Friend 2 says he\u2019s gonna go to the bathroom. Mind you I\u2019m high but I\u2019m not tripping balls and I realize after talking about some shit in our lives with the rest of the guys that Friend Two hasn\u2019t come back from the bathroom. I told everyone to stay there and sure enough he wasn\u2019t in the bathroom and his car was gone. Buddy felt the need to drive home on his first trip because one person was putting out bad vibes. The rest of the boys were pretty happy and whatnot, so I tried to maintain that by not speaking about it, but I\u2019m my head I\u2019m thinking \u201choly fuck you just let him go he\u2019s gonna fuckin die\u201d. I stay up the night with them trying not to think about it, even tho his snapmaps never updated, and eventually we fall asleep around 7 and wake up at noon. Long story short I told them what happened and they said they couldn\u2019t remember because I told them he had to go and they all believed it, and so even tho they weren\u2019t tripping they were really worried. Finally this third guy who\u2019s pretty close to friend one calls him and gets an answer saying he just woke up, who is this. That\u2019s when we all lost the weight on our shoulders and were able to relax again. Once everyone got home I went straight the fuck back to bed, my parents didn\u2019t even question it oddly enough, and everything was normal the next day. Best thing I can say is don\u2019t let bad vibes get you in a bad situation while tripping, I\u2019d imagine I\u2019d rather drive home than sit there angry and scared. \n\nTLDR- Friend drives home during his first trip because other friend is hitting him with bad vibes, be careful who you trip with and have a good time!", "replies": {"fe6qf5b": {"score": 5, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/ensj0c/am_i_being_irrational/fe6qf5b/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1578929350.0, "body": "Driving while tripping is very dangerous and irresponsible.

After going through opiate addiction it\u2019s not the same. It induced anxiety for the longest time until recently. Now I use every day and it\u2019s nice but not on par with most of the drugs on this list. I do like that there is no physical dependency and no side effects. Definitely the safest drug on this list. \r\n\r\nOxycodone(8/10): I haven\u2019t used this one after developing opiate tolerance but it was nice and potent. I don\u2019t think it would do much for me nowadays. Also very expensive.\r\n\r\nCodeine(2/10): quite trash with any sliver of opiate tolerance. I tried taking 200mg recently and all it did was make my scalp extremely itchy and uncomfortable. I\u2019ve been dependent on Kratom for about two years though so I definitely have a tolerance. Kratom has much more effect.\r\n\r\nEtizolam(10/10 therapeutic 1/10 recreational): a phenomenal tool to have for anxiety, comedowns, bad trips etc. Not recreational in the slightest though. Higher doses just make me feel dull, depressed and disconnected.\r\n\r\nHydrocodone(5/10): with tolerance it takes A LOT and not cost effective at all. I prefer Kratom\r\n\r\nAmphetamine(4/10): Has me feeling good and motivated for about an hour, then I just become extremely irritable.\r\n\r\n4-fa(6/10): quite euphoric but not close to being on par with MDMA. Short acting though. Makes me quite irritable while also feeling good.\r\n\r\n2-fma(5/10): more useful than Amphetamine as a functional stim IMO. Smoother comeup/comedown and not much effect on mood.\r\n\r\n2cb(8/10): Very easy psychedelic. Great for beginners. Hardly any headspace and nice eye candy.\r\n\r\nMDMA(10/10): Pure unadulterated love on tap. High therapeutic and recreational value. Definitely an all time favorite. Any sort of \u2018frequent\u2019 use will fuck your state of being up majorly.\r\n\r\nMXE(9/10): Very high therapeutic and recreational value. Really wish I could\u2019ve experimented more with this one. Better than ketamine for sure. It has more depth to it.\r\n\r\nAlcohol(8/10): as an anxious person this is a great one to open me up although the hangovers are a nightmare. Very socially acceptable though, almost too much so.\r\n\r\nComputer Duster(1/10): it\u2019s basically dumpster nitrous. Extremely dirty \u2018wubwubwub\u2019 effect. I can feel the brain cells dying.\r\n\r\nDXM(7/10): this shit was magic when I was a teenager. Quite dirty though. I had an amazing experience on 300mg dxm and 30mg hydrocodone. It is quite unique compared to other dissos. I used this one very frequently for a period of time. It has very nice after glow but definitely causes some brain-fog. Don\u2019t have much desire to use again. I have fond memories of binging trailer park boys and hell on wheels on 300mg doses though. Also the song Dramamine by Modest mouse was my anthem at the time. That song sounded amazing on DXM. \r\n\r\nPropylhexedrine(4/10): dirty stim buzz with a ton of vasoconstriction. If you get it out of the inhalers then my god they taste HORRIFIC. It does have a bit of euphoria though and definitely has the potential to trigger a 6 hour masturbation session.\r\n\r\nClonazepam(6/10): my favorite benzodiazapine. Has a bit more of a livened mood than Etizolam/Xanax. Still sort of a low recreational value though.\r\n\r\n25c-NBOMe(2/10): took this one before I knew what psychedelics really did. No euphoria, just sort of a headfuck and very minimal visuals. The vasoconstriction was pretty bad. At one point I was afraid my dick was going to fall off.\r\n\r\nNitrous(6/10): if only it lasted longer. Quite expensive for a binge but it\u2019s definitely nice and pairs well with pretty much everything.\r\n\r\nBuspirone(1/10): terrible terrible terrible. Just a dirty anxiolytic. Benzos are much better. DON\u2019T INSUFFLATE THIS. It gave me nasty brain zaps. I was a stupid 16 year old.\r\n\r\nAmbien(2/10): sort of like a more wonky benzo. Not very recreational imo. \r\n\r\nSynthetic Cannabinoids(5/10): I\u2019m not sure the exact compounds. I used a blend back around 2015. I enjoyed it but it was pretty dirty. I never got the intense hallucinogenic effects that some describe. It was very similar to cannabis.\r\n\r\nPhenibut(9/10): Very nice mood booster, anxiety reducer and social lubricant. Also pair well with most everything. Super prone to dependency though and has quite a comedown for me even at low doses. I can count on being pretty depressed on the 2nd day after dosing.\r\n\r\nAlprazolam: about the same as Etizolam\r\n\r\nDMT: this one frightens me and I doesn\u2019t have much of a draw towards recreational use at all. This is strictly a tool imo.\r\n\r\nHeroin(10/10): Beautiful but I definitely had a problem with this one. It\u2019s the perfect escape. Numb to everything. I swear my whole family could\u2019ve died and all it would take is a shot and everything is just fine. Addiction has intense negative social impact. I isolated and ignored my issues for about 2 years. It leads you into a stagnant haze.\r\n\r\nLSD(5/10): I\u2019d have to try this one again. I had a bad first experience in which I smoked way too much pot on the comeup and lost most of my ability to comprehend/communicate. This was not good as an already socially anxious person in a social setting. I would like to try again though as I am more comfortable nowadays.\r\n\r\nKratom(9/10): saved me from heroin addiction but Kratom dependency is also a pain in the ass. I dose every 4 hours and interdose anxiety/depression is terrible. My mood is pretty much completely dependent on whether not I have dosed recently. Great mood boost and pro-social effects though. Reduces anxiety and calms but can also Amp you up a bit depending on strain/setting.\r\n\r\n3-Meo-PCP(6/10?): this one is very hard for me to recall. I think I used only about 100mg of this in total spread across different days. I would like to try it again. I did feel a bit of mania which I liked.\r\n\r\nFuranylFentanyl(4/10): the fentalogues have potent opiod effect but very low euphoria IME. Also very short acting. I couldn\u2019t imagine being dependent on them. Seems like a nightmare\r\n\r\nButyrFentanyl(4/10): same as FuranylFentanyl.\r\n\r\nU47700(6/10): more euphoric by quite a bit but also extremely short acting. Also very caustic.\r\n\r\nBuprenorphan(3/10): Good tool for addicts but hardly any recreational value. Takes away most of the physical withdrawals but I still have major cravings. Kratom does a much better job of keeping me clean.\r\n\r\nMethamphetamine(5/10): Used this one for quite a bit. I was mainly drawn to the pipe. Once I realized this was the case I smashed mine and never bought another. I had no issue quitting after that. If you can stick to oral dosing though it\u2019s basically Adderall on steroids. Much longer lasting and smoother come down. I never really experienced the intense euphoria people describe. Just got twacked and paranoid on many occasions.\r\n\r\nTianeptine(3/10): this shit is the devil. Do NOT IV. This is the crack of opiates. Pretty intense rush but less than 30 minutes later and you're mixing another shot. My tolerance rose 3x fold in one day. I used 500mg the first day then 1.5g the next before my 2g was gone. Never bought more because I realized just how dangerous this one could be. I believe this is literally this worst thing you could be dependent on. I hear it also destroys your opiate tolerance to the point where even methadone and fentanyl doesn\u2019t put a dent in WD. It's also extremely caustic and I highly regret putting this in my veins.\r\n\r\nButane(2/10): dirty nitrous like buzz\r\n\r\n2-Methyl-2-Butanol(2/10): extremely dirty benzo-like buzz. Purchased as a potential alcohol replacement while drug/alcohol testing. Tasted absolutely horrible and had some weird side effects such as frequent urination at night and sore/enlarged nipples. Here\u2019s is an in depth post on my experience: https://www.reddit.com/r/drugs/comments/amodap\r\n\r\n1,4-Butanediol(7/10): Very euphoric and has INSANE aphrodisiac properties. It\u2019s very recreational but frequent use lead to my first ever panic attack and fucked up my anxiety for months after. Do not use this one frequently. After a 3 day binge I was paranoid and extremely anxious. This one seems to induce benzo WD like symptoms after a very short period of use. Also fucked up my sleep majorly.\r\n\r\nTramadol(2/10): doesn\u2019t do much at all for opioid tolerant people\r\n\r\nGabapentin(8/10): this is a great tool. I used it mainly for easing heroin WD. The first time I used it in this manner it was a God send. I slept like a baby and felt no WD at all. The second time I had an emotional break down in which I came to the realization of what I was doing to myself with heroin. I had just started IV\u2019ing a week or two prior. I broke down on the floor crying. I was an emotional wreck. This seems to have sort of a psychedelic quality imo. I could see it being quite recreational when not going through WD.\r\n\r\nMethadone(8/10): pretty much pharma heroin. Less euphoria though. If you\u2019re actually trying to escape the life of opiate addiction I think suboxone is much better. Methadone still gets you high af. It\u2019s a full opioid agonist just like heroin and scratches the same itch. The main difference is it gets you away from the needle and you don\u2019t have to worry about where your next fix is coming from. \r\n\r\nKetamine(9/10): I love this one. Quite recreational with no physical dependency potential. Great positive effects on anxiety and depression. I find it hard to describe but it\u2019s sort of like a serene, disconnected alcohol like buzz. Very calming. I have yet to experience the 'hole'.\r\n\r\nKava(6/10): nice alcohol replacement. Has a sort of stoning quality to it. No hangover or WD. Eases anxiety and lifts mood quite nicely.\r\n\r\n4-aco-met(10/10): my favorite psychedelic. Nice euphoria. MDMA-like entactogenic effects. Eye candy visuals and hardly any mind fuck although my highest dose was only 15mg. Buddy took 20mg though and LOVED IT.\r\n\r\n2-fdck(8/10): Very very similar to ketamine but it lacks something.", "author": "Exa8yte", "score": 257, "flair": "Long Post", "created": 1596617066.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/i3viw4/44_drugs_ive_used_and_my_reviews_on_them/", "num_comments": 74, "title": "44 drugs I've used and my reviews on them", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"g0eakqg": {"score": 99, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/i3viw4/44_drugs_ive_used_and_my_reviews_on_them/g0eakqg/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1596618098.0, "body": "All this drugs and no psilocybin?", "replies": {"g0ec2f4": {"score": 40, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/i3viw4/44_drugs_ive_used_and_my_reviews_on_them/g0ec2f4/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1596618984.0, "body": "Yeah, I guess for the longest time RC tryptamines were easier to get and also far cheaper.

The trip in that case is also very different and follows principles of Monism in the direction it goes IMO.\n\nSolo DMT is like a gun is to your head after the second hit and taking the third anyway despite everything going fucking psychotic feels like the equivalent of shouting \"DO IT BITCH\" in the gun scenario.\n\nIt doesn't matter that you know you're on drugs or how much you pre-prepared telling yourself it's a mind trick. It won't seem that way when you get there trust me. You'll also forget you're on drugs after the breakthrough usually but it don't matter then because you already pulled the trigger on the metaphohorical gun to your head.\n\nIt is similar to Salvia but without the Windows XP glitch madness effect or sense of motion.\n\n...\n\nRegarding psychedelics in general, overuse makes you VERY detached from \"\"\"reality\"\"\" as reality is understood from the human subjective experience.

Soon you'll be able to write a novel lol.  But srsly, this is a pretty solid subjective general description of the drugs you've tried and I can find a lot of the experiences very relatable.  Otherwise, stay strong in this period of opioid addiction you're going through.  It's a good thing you didn't delve deeper into the tianeptine/fent experience.  That stuff is truly scary in regards to it's addictive and dependence forming potential.  I agree that fent is oddly non-euphoric, although still more sedating than most opes in the classic opioid fashion.  Some people however strongly disagree and get hooked, and when it comes time to quit, it can be a hell like no other.  Good you dodged that bullet.  As for tianeptine, if they're leaving it legal, they really may as well make hydro, tramadol, codeine, etc legal.  I'm all for the decriminalization and potential legalization of drugs, but it's hard to deny that tianeptine in such an odd-ball with regards to it's legal status in a lot of places.  If you are currently working on getting off kratom, whether you try to taper or go balls to the wall cold turkey, good luck.  Kratom withdrawals can be a real clusterfuck.  Personally, I actually used bupe to taper off and had much more success with that.  It unfortunately really isn't the walk in the park it's frequently made out to be once you get to the high doses it sounds like your on.  Regardless, don't shy away from recovery if you get to the point that you decide you're done with life on opes.\n\nOne more thing I'd like to add is that propylhexedrine can be a really interesting drug if you decide to do an acid base extraction with it.  It's kinda at a disadvantage when comparing it to other drugs if you're just putting the cotton in OJ or something or just eating it straight because of just how fucking nasty it can be.  Propylhexedrine HCl when taken routes other than orally (NOT IV!!!  IV PROPYLHEXEDRINE CAN KILL) imo seems to be absorbed much better and come with much more pleasant effects.  When smoked, it's actually an interestingly chill stim high you wouldn't expect from propylhexedrine considering how adrenergic and intense it feels taken orally.  There's definitely a lot less vasoconstriction, and you need very little to go a long way.  It also really made me really wanna redose smoked.  I did bing it for a while which was a bad idea because the cardiac effects became increasingly apparent with each consecutive dose and it's pleasant effects became less and less apparent very quickly.  Smoked, it personally kinda feels like a mix of Ritalin and a little bit of dxm.

I subconsciously started dosing more frequently simply in response to interdose withdrawal symptoms (anxiety, racing thoughts, fatigue, yawning, nausea, sweats, and sniffles) and making a concrete dosing schedule to stick to each day was difficult.  I was able to get bupe from an addiction specialist even though I was just taking kratom.  I may have gotten lucky, but it seems like more and more specialists are becoming aware of kratom addiction.  They waited for me first to go into withdrawals and gave me clonidine before letting me have sub even though it seems that people don't generally require a induction period during the switch from kratom to bupe.  I was with my mom at the time, and when she called and discussed my symptoms, they gave me 4mg and told me to take two mg every two hours until I felt comfortable.  It sounds like you already have some experience with sub so you probably have a vague idea how to dose.  For example, I took 8, and frankly that was quite high. I also had a pretty large habit compared to what you got going on at this point.  You could probably get away with 2mg or so at this point (try 1-1.5mg first).  \n\nThe interdose withdrawal with sub tapering is definitely noticeable, but not nearly as intense or sudden ime, and that frankly made a big difference along with the fact that I really didn't need to schedule doses (just took one in the morning and one in the evening).  Overall I had some crankiness, fatigue, mild hot flashes, sniffles, yawns, stretching, tummy troubles, etc but it was generally very mild.  Even though I would say the physical withdrawals from sub are definitely less severe that physical withdrawals from other opes, I would say they can be overall a little bit more prominent than with kratom, but it was definitely less intense psychologically.  I actually got overall pretty sleepy while tapering, although at the start of my taper I unsurprisingly had some sleeping troubles.  Regardless of what you're tapering with, you can expect that.  With tapering sub, you gotta go slow because of how long it takes for sub to leave your system.  I did a 25-33% dose reduction every 3 weeks to a month, which was definitely enough time to recover.\n\nSorry these are so damn long.  Good luck man.

You know the ass is real when it claps back when you hit it. \ud83c\udf51\ud83c\udf51\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udca6\n\nFuck me though dude I could get SO addicted to this shit. It makes you feel amazing and lasts like 6 fucking hours. Like all I wanna do is play guitar, blast loud music, drive really fast and FUCK. Like omg I could seriously please three fat chicks on their periods on this shit. \n\nLike I can really see why people get addicted to meth and shit. It makes you feel fucking INCREDIBLE. It's like opiates but in reverse. Fuck man opiates are my kryptonite but I come REALLY close to saying I like this shit better. Only thing is amp isn't really something you can use all the time. It makes you stay awake and staying awake for days at a time sucks, especially when you're on this shit. You see shadow people and rain falling from the sky (and ceiling) that doesn't exist and you get paranoid and anxious thinking the shadow demons are following you and trying to kill you or enslave you or something. Plus staying awake for that long just feels *wrong* like after the first couple days I can just *feel* the shit damaging my body. It almost makes me feel guilty for doing it. Like I feel guilty for harming my body and my brain. I feel guilty for being on drugs when my family is there, loving me and wanting what's best for me. \n\nBut opiates are so well-rounded. Like you can take them to perk you up in the morning, motivate you in the middle of the day, help you unwind from the workday AND help you sleep at night. Like you're not gonna stay up for says on opiates and start freaking out having psychosis and manic episodes n shit. You're just chill all the time with your pupils the size of molecules. \n\nThat's why I'm hella addicted to kratom lol. Ngl I take like 30g of the shit three times a day. It sucks cuz half the time it makes me puke and tastes like shit and just overall makes you feel like shit. I hate the kratom taste on my tongue after I take it and it last SOOO long. Like soda, food, milk, nothing helps it. But I'm a pussy and I'm afraid of withdrawals so ya know i just keep the cycle going. \n\nThat being said, kratom feels fucking LIT when you're on addy. Like it brings your \"up\" down to a more baseline level and enhances the euphoria by like 10. It's good after like four or five hours of addy. It almost feels like it brings back the high a little bit when you're coming down. Addy is like a fast-acting antidepressant. Fuck man it's so fucking good. Like if I could, I would make sweet tender LOVE to this molecule ALL NIGHT LONG. I bet addy would have a sexy fat ass that jiggles on your dick. MMMMM!!! FUCK MAN. Although I feel like addy would be a male if it was a person. But hey I swing both ways so idgaf \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f let's get down to BIDNESS. \n\nAnyway I been typing for like 8 years or something so I better post this.

I only take addy like once or twice a week. Which probably isn't great still but I'm not dependent on it physically. \n\nHowever I am also dependent on phenibut. I take around 3g a day on top of the kratom. Phenibut is my next challenge to tackle. I really do wanna get off this shit though dude. I hate shoving 90g of plant powder down my throat every day. I hate having to take phenibut in order to function properly as a human being. It really, really sucks. But I really am determined to get off this shit and start my life anew. I can't wait to be free of substances. \n\nWith some addy on the side, of course.", "replies": {"fgl5zpa": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/eyzj65/i_fucking_love_adderall_omg/fgl5zpa/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1580911972.0, "body": "You can start tapering now with pretty low impact on your ability to function.

Take breaks from it to keep it working well.", "replies": {}}}}, "glfk1t": {"text": "If you're from Northern VA area and get offered \"boot\" which they say is smokeable molly, in essence, you might wanna read this.\n\nBoot is a drug thats been on the streets in my hometown (In Northern Va*) for a couple years now and its on the rise.\nBoot gets sold by the gram or points and it comes as a pale, almost-white colored, nearly opaque soft crystalline rock that typically is served with somw excess white powder coating the surface of the rock. It breaks apart into smaller rocks and bits of powder when you apply a little pressure with your fingers.\nThe way myself and the people I know that buy it too almost exclusively smoke it. \n\nI mean its vaporizing really but people just say smoking for convenience, I guess, and although you can light it on fire, it's almost always wasted by then. Anyways, you do like what you would with crack (or coke, water, and baking soda mixed together) or meth and dont have a pipe: You sprinkle just a little bit on a little square piece of foil, then lightly run the lighter across the bottom and little wisps of what almost looks like white solid smoke that disintegrates when you touch it will come off of it first and the rock powder will start melting into the foil a bit and will be stuck to it. Then you pull the lighter away and blow very lightly to get the little wisps of what I've been told is excess baking soda off of your pile of half melted Boot.\n\nYou then put a straw or a hollowed out pen in your mouth and hold it over the boot while holding the lighter still on the bottom of the foil. The substance on the foil should almost immediately change colors to dark orange and melt while simultaneously sizzling and releasing smoke from the oil (superheated, melted boot) thats now boiling.\nYou pull the lighter away once it pops off like that but keep pulling vapor through the tube or pipe you're using to suck it up; the boot will keep boiling for a couple seconds even after the flame is removed from the foil. Keep breathing in until it stops boiling and smoking and by now your chest should feel about to burst.\nHold for about 10 seconds give or take a few depending on how big of a hit you took. \nThere should be a yellow/orange oil and/or black dried tar looking shit.\nYou can reheat and boil off the oil to get more hits especially when theres still unvaporized rock stuck on. You MIGHT be able to get a little hit out of the black residue depending on how much you milked the oil or rock that transformed into tar, but i wouldn't count on it.\n\nBy the way, the smoke smells and tastes like burnt/burning chemicals (best explanation i can give lol). It's not particularly strong in taste or smell, i actually have smoked it indoors many times and i never got caught using it by the people who i rent my place out from.\n\n* I promise I'm not sourcing moderators, im just giving my region of Va for the fellow Virginians who might have encountered the same drug *\n\nSo for all of my fellow drug users/psychonauts, I will answer the question you've been waiting for:\n\nH  o  w    D o e s    B  o  o  t    F  e  e  l ?\n\nBy the time you release the smoke you'll already feel it coming on, and VERY rapidly.\nIt's nothing too intense off of one rip, most people who know their way around stimulants will be able to handle one rip at the very least. \nOne hit is basically a threshold dose but it fills your lungs and you will feel a lil' somethin' creep in real quickly. \nRight away i was able to tell that a single hit of this is comparatively weak but on the same token i cpuld also tell right away that getting plastered with this \"boot\" stuff is more than possible with enough a few good hits considering how the first couple I took.\n\nAfter you breathe out your big lungful air, if you havent already, you should begin feeling a warm, pleasurable tingling feel begin to manifest in your body. The body high feels most prominent in your head and chest but it also can make your whole body feel heavenly and energized with power. The desire to move your body turns more and more into a perception of HAVING to move the more you smoke and if you don't do it voluntarily, you'll get very twitchy and shaky and clench your jaw alot but i dont really mind that stuff so i dont consider it a negative effect, but it might bother other people, so.\n\nFor the next 10-30 minutes or so after you initially exhale and feel your body high out you'll feel like talking and talking and talking and then doing some more when you're done. The euphoria (especially when taking consecutive hits in a short period of time to get a much stronger buzz that lasts longer too) can get quite intense. It feels like rolling on a little bit of molly with a LOT of adderall on lower doses. Doing large amounts of boot (that's mainly binging; I've only a couple of times seen someone take a big hit of boot and simply leave it at that).\n\nThe mind high is interesting because Boot is basically a freebased mixture of two stimulants: one is very MDMA-like and trippy and the other is more amphetamine-like and energizing. In lower doses you feel like you're almost exclusively on an amphetamine or a purely stimulating substance with a subtle hint of something different.\nEffects on the mind:\n -euphoria\n -distractedness\n -racing thoughts\n -emotional contentness\n -carefree attitude\n\nIn higher doses that subtle hint becomes more amd more obvious until you take enough Boot to where it feels like railing some Adderall IR while already rolling on MDMA; things start getting trippy and hard to keep up with mentally as well and the stimulation coincides and increases with the \"trippiness\" of your perception. It can also cause some minor anxiety.\nSome greater effects on the mind:\n -blank-mindedness\n -extreme talkativety\n -chaotic, racing thoughts\n -carefree attitude\n -can cause bouts of anxiety but is fairly easily conquerable\n -\"trippiness\": light visual distortions, awareness of warped perception and perception of inner comprehension processes\n\nDid i forget to mention compulsive redosing is just barely short of impossible of being prevented? \n--Because of the nature of the boot high and how it affects you hit-for-hit, it is essentially inevitable that if you hit the boot once and feel it you'll do it again as soon as you can after the first hit and you'll keep hitting it until you're rolling where you'd like to be.\nLike N2O or Crack**, Boot doesn't last very long; the initial head rush lasts anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes if you do a single dose or a couple consecutive dosages. It's more than possible to make the rush last hours if you're continually redosing every 10-20 mimutes every time you feel the rush starting to slow down until you want to go to sleep.\n\nMY body hasnt had an obvious tolerance to Boot before except im high usage but it seems to go away very rapidly (i.e., after a couple of days at most) which basically means that I don't develop a tolerance to this unless I redose and binge on this stuff for a night and then I just have to wait a day or two and then I'm be good to take it again and roll just as hard as I did the last time I dosed, if I wamted to go crazy. I'm sure it's not good for your brain though, i would treat this drug as about on the same level as molly and coke. Dont do it a lot if you do it, you'll have to moderate your usage very closely especially if you have a history of drug abuse/addiction.\n\n** I compared n2o and crack specifically because they're both short lasting but incredibly euphoric drugs that you inhale for best effects **\n\nW  h  a  t    i  s    B o o t ?\n\nSo here's the catch: I found out almost immediately after getting and doing some boot that Boot is NOT pure MOLLY/MDMA. I was told that \"its basically like molly you can smoke\".\nI ended up getting real molly again a couple of months after trying and using boot and i wanted to test to see if it WOULD boil and vaporize off tin foil because at the time my only knowledge of what was in boot is a little bit of mdma then some \"synthetic shit\" which makes me wonder if one of the dudes who sells it is referencing a research chemical.\nOddly enough, even though everybody i asked said it was a waste of mdma, I did successfully boil it off of the tin foil and i DID im fact feel something that was very reminiscent with but not identical with the boot high. Noted.\nSo, so far I knew that it wasn't MDMA but it feels like it, just mixed in with another upper, so it either has MDMA in it but its just such a minute amount it doesn't pop on the test, vaporizing mdma just doesn't show up on ur screening for some reason, OR it's just some sort of R.C. that somebody in the drug hotspot for my county is getting in bulk and it feels very similar to MDMA. Alas, I've found next to nothing on MDMA analogues existing on the RC market.\n\nInterestingly, I took a urine drug test one time not 12 hours after i had last done boot and i didn't pop for anything but amphetamines (not METH but the AMP test result) and i suspect that was because i had done adderall the day before as well. \nI didnt pop for anything but two things out of the 12 on the test and that's AMP and THC.\nI'd also like to draw attention to the fact that i pissed CLEAN of COC (cocaine), METH, and MDMA (molly or what molly is SUPPOSED to be).\nWhich is interesting because I've also heard more than one person say it wont pop on drug screens.\nSo, naturally I wouldn't believe that until i saw it for myself but i dont know if thats true or if it just pops for Amphetamines; I can't confirm or deny if it pops up on urine drug screenings.\n\nSo just the other day I finally got through to one of the people who makes boot in my area, and he claims that all Boot is is coke, baking soda, a littlee bit of water, and a little bit of powdered mdma all mixed together on a baking sheet on put in the oven where it hardens and becomes the rocks that everybody in the loop around here knows and loves (sorry for all the chem guys who r cringing at my lack of values or units for that synthesis lmao).\nI'm not sure how much i believe this because of the drug screening oddities but the way boot behaves when you're hitting it and when you're rolling on it would be explained well if it really is basically a solid freebase splution of cocaine and MDMA. Probably very dangerous too but luckily there isn't much of either in any given amount of boot im almost positive it's only a little bit of mdma and mostly  freebased coke.\n\nE v e r y b o d y   w h o   w a n t s   t o   c o m m e n t   \n\ns h o u l d  r e a d  t h e  t e x t  b e l o w  s o  w e  c a n   \n\nh a v e  a n  u n d e r s t a n d i n g  a n d  n o t  h a v e   \n\np o i n t l e s s  c o n f l i c t;  t h e r e' s  t o o  m u c h  \n\na s  i s  r i g h t  n o w.  \n\nIm testing the effects of drugs on my perception and what the \"best\" ways to go about using said drugs and documenting the results. And sometimes that can mean trying drugs i haven't and having to take a trusted friends word that its safe (enough) instead of sending it to a lab or however the hell else yall think I'd be able to do with the shit figure out all of whats in it bcuz normal tests would make it pop for two different things most likely. (Coke and mdma)\nPeople are gonna wanna hate on me or think im an idiot for trying shit i didn't test and i just wanna let you all know that im not a scientist, professional, or even \"safe\" (my definition of safe is: not unsafe enough to put you immediate danger by doing it [the mf drugs] correctly) person but i know my stuff when it comes to drugs; ive been around the block way TOO much for someone my age. I'm not claimimg to be an expert but I've tried and chased after so many different states of mind, including dangerous combinations or dangerous amounts of stuff in the hardest part of my poly-addiction (my drug hayday i guess you could say haha.. which was only a little over a year ago...yes im doing boot as an addict and im on it rn but yesterday was a day for celebrating and its been months). honestly, regardless of how reckless i was at the beginning with this drug i have done it so many times now that i feel that i have a very strong understanding of it now and im trying to not only increase that understanding and learn more from it, but im also trying to educate other people and keep the community informed on this seemingly new hard drug.\nI'll listen to whatever you people have to say to me or about my choices but my point is i know why and how my choices are stupid but im sure there are still gonna be plenty of people saying shit. Just know im not gonna engage with any rude or insulting people in the comments the point of this post is education for myself hopefully and anyone else who does this drug or is thinking about getting some and you should side with knowledge and reason not close-mindedness and biases. \n\nLet me know your thoughts on this or if you have any useful insights plz in the comments bcuz id LOVE a  second opinion", "author": "playing_with_death", "score": 68, "flair": null, "created": 1589751531.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/glfk1t/boot_the_mystery_hard_drug_thats_spreading_around/", "num_comments": 47, "title": "\"Boot\": The mystery hard drug that's spreading around my area and what it's like", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fqxthcy": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/glfk1t/boot_the_mystery_hard_drug_thats_spreading_around/fqxthcy/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1589766403.0, "body": "Option 1 \n\nGet a damn test kit.

No one is going to believe it, but fuck it. It's honestly one of the only achievements I'm proud of in my life so far.\n\nTo preface this, I want to mention that I believe cocaine to be an unnecessary drug, and that in my honest opinion isn't worth doing or even trying. My experience with this drug has been almost entirely negative, but I wanted to, in spite of this, highlight that this drug can bring positive experiences, albeit very rarely. \n\nWhen this took place, I was a 21 year old virgin, with a lot of insecurities. I'd been sexually frustrated for a while, and used a lot of porn for this reason. Before departing on the pilgrimage through Spain (Camino De Santiago) where these events took place, I'd decided that I wanted to be entirely celibate throughout the whole trip. I even started the celibacy beforehand. I was also on SSRI antidepressants before and during the whole pilgrimage. \n\nAs I was nearing the end of the journey through Spain, (I was 90 km away from finishing the whole 800 km) my friends who I was traveling with had to leave to go back to our home country. This meant that I was walking alone for many hours each day, which resulted in me becoming pretty lonely. During the trip id stumbled upon many interesting people, one of which was an older woman (in her 40's) who well call Lauren. Lauren had been friendly towards me, and had even bought me a drink at the bar where I met her, on the premise that I'd let her know if I happened to find some weed. Usually, pilgrims would not be many kms ahead of eachother, which meant that it was quite likely to run into the same people multiple times, if one were to walk at a consistent pace. I stumbled into her a few times after the event at the bar, and even supplied her a bit of weed one time as a friendly gesture. \n\nFast forward to the end of the trip. I was all alone I this coastal town, which is known for its hardpartying pilgrims, who want to celebrate their completion of the journey. Id heard word about a hippie/alt bar and meeting place, which was open 24/7, serving food during the day, and drinks at night. I went there to have lunch and kill time, but most off all to meet some people so that I wouldn't feel as lonely. As I went outside for a homerolled rizla, I saw Lauren. She was happy to see me, and suggested I should come back later that night and have a drink with her. She also mentioned the abundance of drugs that was available, from the various persons that frequented this place. \n\nAs I came back later that night, Lauren and I started drinking and talking to other pilgrims. At this point i didn't even for a second consider that she'd be interested in me. We got fairly loaded, and after our tenth drink, Lauren suggested we'd get some coke. At this point I'd been off the booger sugar for a few months, but in my inebriated state, I wasnt able to turn the idea down. We started railing line, going in and out of the bathroom together every 30 minutes or so. If there was a polar opposite word for incognito this would describe what we did pretty well. As the night progressed, people started to leave. Lauren and I kept doing coke and drinking until it was only the two of us and the two bartenders left. They offered us some more coke, so we started railing lines behind the bar. Eventually it was four am, and the bartenders told us that they had to close down for the night. At this point I was drunk, coked up, stoned but most of all incredibly horny. I'd been celibate for 60 days or so. As Lauren and I went out the door, she asked me a question. She inquired as to if I was even able to find my way home in my inebriated state. My first thought was to reply that yes, I knew exactly where my hostel was, but somehow I managed to lie and tell her I couldn't find my way home. She suggested we went back to her AirBnb so that I could get some WiFi and find my hostel at Google maps. Needless to say, I spent the night with her. Because of the coke, the SSRI I was taking and the alcohol combined is lasted for way longer than I ever imagined I would for my first time. And because of the celibacy I was more than able to get it up. I acted like a complete animal, talking dirty and taking charge during the sex. She even stuck a finger in my ass. Next morning she gave me a goodbye blowjob. I went out the door felt about as good as you can feel, feeling the Spanish morning sun on my face, still slightly amped, drunk but most of all happy.\n\nI doubt this would have happened, had I not done cocaine.\n\nEdit: Cocaine consumption didn't actually start until around midnight. I definitely did not do more than 1 gram during that whole night. Lauren and I split a gram, of which she did the most of it, and the bartenders offered us some, of which I did a few lines. As I previously stated, I'm not surprised that people are hesitant to believe this story.

Not long ago was Thursday evening started doing some fine Speed and without noticing 12 hours has passed already... Amphetamine can be real time machine sometimes lol. In 12 hours managed to snort only 6 lines. Still have some Speed left so maybe I gonna be trying to fix my health until evening.. Anyways, I'm sitting alone this early morning wanting to post something interesting, something great to read and try getting attention and lots of comments from people. Not sure how everything will work out or even will it be worth to spend time reading all of this at all... So I thought maybe I can try to write something about **why e.g. same white looking Speed powders one time can stimulate very euphoric and next time isn't as much euphoric even though it's look like the same white powder? What kind of magic it is? Amphetamine is a GIN who is folded in baking foil waiting for adventurer who will release hidden powder magic and will gain GIN'S super powers. Also if your drug dealer is richer then you can get these magic dusts into small drug bag which can be opened and closed. Anyway Amphetamines can surprise you every time you buy them. All information from one person researches and personal experience. Hopefully you'll be interested to read as I'm interested in writing all of this.  Read further for interesting and educational information.**\n\n....\n\n**Intro**\n\nLet's begin with introduction. Amphetamines is stimulant drugs and are used both medically to treat ADHD, narcolepsy and recreationally in a nutshell speaking to simply get high. Most popular administration methods is taking **orally**(*for teenagers, first timer, and girls*), **snorting**\\*(men's method, for constipated tweekers who knows what they doing\\*), **Injecting**(*for people who's not wasting any high and consuming their drug productively or in other words for people with deep problems \\*not recommending trying\\**). **Chasing euphoria, redosing every 30-60mins  although peak lasts 4-6 hours, craving or self-exhortation for getting \"a little bit\" more even though half of gram is still in the pocket knowing it's 2am already and for sure it will be enough till morning.** But you know how people say: better more than too little? Tweeking person is ready for anything, rock n rolling so to say, and once you come up with idea of getting more. Well... Don't even start comparing pros and cons because if there are Pros like still having money in my wallet then I'm sorry but Cons like \"It will be enough as far as I have\" won't change your deep tweeker beliefs. Yes everyone! I'm talking about good old Speed great high, not so great comedowns and of course let's not forget top phrase \"One more line and I stop\" while still having 3 grams and using all your willpower that's left with all might trying to stop and \"save some\" Speed for next time. But it's so hard and while deep in your heart you know there are low chances to win against yourself and flushing everything in toilet seems great idea you just can't make it. It would be a pity to throw away such goodness. Stalemate. Concluding I want to say that if you manage to stop doing Speed while still having of it, survived comedowns and when your mind is coming up with fun ideas every 10 mins why doing more Speed on day 3 with no sleep is still reasonable thing to do then bro congratulation you either not in love with Speed, you are not addicted or you just have Avenger balls. Worthy of being Avenger of psychotropic substances a.k.a Captain Speeder or Iron TheFastMan. You won't get gold medals or awards because our society still thinking substance abuse is incurable disease. So we learned about Amphetamine a little bit, we understood it's properties, how it's working, what should be expected and how it hacking persons brain but the most important thing to realize is no matter how much you'll done there always be a place with strong desire for one more line. This concludes the first paragraph.\n\n....\n\n**Levoamphetamine and Dextroamphetamine**\n\nNow I want to talk about something different. About science based information. About tweeker junkie drug abuser experience who was abusing Street Amphetamine for some time, who tasted all kinds of different powder stuff from a line of baking soda to the cleanest and purest stuff that rare who ever get his hands on. From stuff that is best of the best to worst out of worst YUCK. So shall we begin? Let's start with asking our self what makes Amphetamine being great, euphoric, energized and what makes it to be a complete piece of shit, a disaster, that gives no effects just causes insomnia and reluctance eating? Well first and best answer is it's purity of course. 50% pure amphetamine will hit you multiple times harder and stronger then e.g. 5% of powder. That's truth and most people only look into this one criterion when deciding if his Speed good or not. However there are some other things that dictate how your Speed gonna be stimulating. **First** let's say we get high purity stuff from our first hands dealer who's not putting any shitty impurities like caffeine, creatine, baking soda etc., not seeking to increase their profit. This stuff is all white, in big not crushed pieces and has strong smell. No way something is mixed in it. It's great stuff that stimulates amazing, euphoria is out of the roof, sense of well being, overwhelming feeling just great high. **Next time** you once again get 100% clean white powder not crushed all in big pieces just this time you bought this stuff from other dealer because your go to guy is empty this time. What the fuck is the difference you think to yourself? Speed is just speed and this stuff looks nice, definitely strong high purity one. However, you done some of it and your mood dropped. This time Amphetamine isn't feeling this great, euphoria is there but not as strong and intense, it's dull and soon high will become boring, feeling great but not that great like you got previous time... Good Speed tho but nothing too impressive compared with stuff from first dealer. Now the question is what's happened? Both products were very high purity from first hand dealers no other shitty stuff were mixed. Why effects not the same or even not closely similar? **Answer is because of Levoamphetamine and Dextroamphetamine % in powder.** **Levoamphetamine** is more about to increasing wakefulness and concentration. **Dextroamphetamine** is different and it causes other effects, recreational effects and is aphrodisiac and responsible for sex drive, libido and most importantly it responsible for recreational euphoria that we all keep seeking when using this drug. So not sure If I be right here because not remembering everything correctly but I think Street Speed is 50% Levo and 50% Dextro normally. Of course this 50/50 number not carved on stone and I guess it can vary depending who and how is manufacturing this drug. On the other hand, if I'm not fking up medication Adderall is 75% Levo and 25% Dextro. Numbers is different between Street amphetamine and pharmaceutical medication. Theoretically thinking Street amphetamine should be more for recreational use and should be a lot more euphoric compared with Adderall.\n\n.......\n\n**Yellow - Speed / White Amphetamine. 2 Slightly different highs. Lithuania**\n\nNow I know a lot of people gonna say that amphetamine powder colors don't matter and is just sign of impurities. I strongly dare to argue with all of you. 1/3 you don't know about Amphetamines that much or you just don't have like these amphetamines in your country or you not getting variety of amphetamines. From my personal experience and from my friends circle there are two types of Amphetamine who looks different, works a little bit different, effects also little bit different, appearance different. They names will be confusing but that's how we call them in our country. For now just remember or imagine that Amphetamine is Amphetamine and Speed is Speed. **They both are different drugs in this paragraph**.  I'm talking about well known **white dry powder, regular looking, Amphetamine.** It's dry so a gram of it is a lot and you can make lots of lines at least 10-15+. Normally people snort it or shoot it some drink it. Let's say we gonna snort it because it's the most popular way. When snorted if purity is high or medium level people experience \"the rush\" that lasts about 30-60 mins. During the rush you feel euphoric, sense of well being, overwhelmed.... Normally when snorted after experiencing the rush people can still feel drug peaking for next 3-4 hours but normally they not waiting 3-4 hours till peak ends and just make a next line and re-experience the rush once again. Because from a gram of this Amphetamine you can make a lot of lines people tend to snort every hour or so and feel just rush effects. Now about yellow one - Speed that his name. That's how we call it in Lithuania. It's pretty rare stuff to get. It's always yellow, dark yellow color and wet. Both of these are different drugs without similarities. Gram of Speed is always small amount. You can make like 4-6 Lines from whole gram of it. Seems not a lot but a line of this Speed, for me maybe two lines, I always need more makes me high from 4 to 6 hours. You won't feel any rush and the whole experience will be slightly different compared with white Amphetamine. I didn't done it a lot because like I said it's rare stuff to get but after snorting effects builds up slowly. P.S. There are sometimes similar amps with some similar high like this yellow Speed. Slowly sense of \"being well\" somewhere from deep inside your soul comes out. This sense keeps building and building until it peaks after like 20-30 mins. Then you'll be feeling very good, chill, in love with everything, on your heart you are feeling very lightweight or easy like feather would be fallen on your hearts and you now all drowning in this lovely calm, \"everything is perfect\", all worries disappeared and I have left with this satisfaction and deep euphoric feeling that is spreading from inside of me. Yellow Speed gives very different effects compare with regular white Amphetamine. Yellow Speed is more for satisfaction, chill, feeling lovely, sense of love who spreading somewhere from inside of your soul. Very pleasant high. Now white Amphetamine is like normal amphetamine. You snort a line and almost instantly rock n rolling, felling this rush that is going through your body, you get talkative, energetic, euphoric, ready for doing or going anywhere etc.\n\n\\-----------\n\n**Amphetamine strength / purity / usage and binging?**\n\nEdit 3pm:\n\nSo yeah I thought maybe I write here a little bit more about my thoughts what amphetamine purity works for me best. Does the stronger powder is the better? Or maybe very strong is even harmful? Well of course when talking about Amphetamine purity the stronger you get the better it is. People expect every time to get clean and pure product. However, using too strong of this drug is not always the best decision. It really depends how you like doing it. From my experience binging strong stuff is the worst thing you can do. You exhausts your body a lot and quite often lose some body weight due to lack of nutrition and high stimulation causing you to burn fat for the energy. Also your brain suffers not less then your body either. Stimulating your brain with such powerful and pure Speed for few days straight without sleep and low food consumption drains everything from you. Your neurotransmitters is drained and they will need multiple days to recover and if you binging with strong stuff every weekend your dopamine never recover fully for sure. So yeah not recommending binging strong stuff. Strong stuff can be used for let's say short - medium length experience. You shouldn't exceed 8-10 or max 12 hours mark. What you doing is hitting your dopamine hard for short - medium time duration and before it gets too much drainer you stopping. You'll be feeling great high and won't fuck up your dopamine that much. Of course you shouldn't be sniffing Speed every 30 mins and raving like there is no tomorrow. It won't make any good for your brain if you snort for 10 hours and blast ton of Speed. Keep drug usage in moderation. If you still feeling great why the fuck do even more? Moderation is the key for everything especially when using hard drugs like Stimulants. **Next let's talk what if I really want to stay up for couple of days and push away comedowns for a little bit more?** Let's face it **Amphetamine high can be true time machine and for example 10 hours of Speeding isn't that much of time. If you feel great, staying busy and having amazing time 10 hours can be felt like 2 hours or less. I posting on reddit for like 20 hours already** with smoke breaks or letting my eyes to rest every an hour or two. Time flew in no time and on Speed time is not your friend. Time speeds up on amphetamine and is the real BS when an hour feels like 10 minutes. The more you FUCKED UP or High the faster time will fly. One of the reason why keeping your intoxication levels at moderation and staying in touch with reality is a good thing. Anyways, you don't want to stop using after 8 or 10 or even 12 hours. You have few days off and want to be active for 1.5-2 days straight but don't want to fuck yourself up a lot. Then medium strength Speed should be your thing. Of course not always you can select what Speed you wanna be consuming so doing math and tracking how strong your stuff is and how much you can / are consuming is a key thing. It's not an easy task tracking and moderating your intoxication while feeling amazing and wanting to get high even more. So ,anyways let's say you start going fast in the eveningof Friday and planning to use till at least Saturday night. Let's say you have mediocre strength amphetamine. This all night should be amazing you should be euphoric, energized, stimulating nicely. Keep redosing but try stay in moderation. Remember the more you intoxicated, the more you disconnected from reality and the faster time will fly. There is no point get amphed till top ceiling and from there are no where to go anymore. You draining your precious dopamine and more sooner euphoria and other good things disappear. Be euphoric, feel amazing but control your high. Remember we want to save our dopamine for as long as possible so sniffing it like no tomorrow not smart idea at all. It's like having tasty food that you love. You can eat all of it in 30mins or you can eat it slowly and having fun for 2 hours. You should spend all night feeling nice. However, during early morning big chances you'll start feeling a little bit down. Or maybe not who the fuck knows lol. That's normal because you haven't slept and it's early morning affects your body somehow. Drink some coffee or smoke a cigarette or do anything you want to do e.g. post on reddit like I do and just stay busy. Amphetamine effects might start slowly began reduce, euphoria disappear, amazing feeling will be replaced with just feeling good  and high might become weaker. However, if you be into something like playing video game or posting on reddit or anything similar, keeping your mind away from surroundings you'll be feeling great. It's everything normal and that's how all works. Don't know why but mornings always raises negative feelings. Feeling dull and nostalgic that whole night already ended makes at least me feel annoyed.  When day goes on during noon you should start feeling better and when evening comes again you'll be great. Of course you won't be euphoric and feeling that great like on first day when your body is fresh and dopamine is untouched. But also you won't be coming down yet so all good. Now when 2nd days evening comes you have to decide do more Speed or not. Maybe you tired and bored from everything and you just plan go sleeping asap. Or maybe you having good time with your mates and want to stay awake so doing so more of Speed is the right thing. I personally on second days evening can do more Speed if I have alcohol because I fall a sleep anyways.  Spending evening drinking beer or smoking joint or doing both could make things different. Often alcohol and cannabis elevates your mood and you can enjoy and feel great even though you coming down.\n\n tldr : Binging strong Speed is never a good idea because you are depleting your body and your brain a lot. Strong stuff should be used for short - medium length experience 8-10 or max 12 hours trip. Binging Speed  is like an art with math elements and strong self discipline. Staying busy whole experience is best you can do. You won't crave more Speed that much. Moderation is a key. For binging it is better to use medium strength Speed because you want to keep your dopamine alive as long as possible and also you don't want to deplete your body and brain too much during this marathon. Binging strong Speed you need to be even more careful and self disciplined if you don't want to over drain your dopamine and body.  E.g. I stayed up for day 2 now and I was snorting very good and strong Speed every 3 or 4 hours a line. I've been busy whole time so I didn't get urge to do a little bit more after an hour. Experience was great I was very high and Euphoric, time flied 5x faster and that's sucks. **Maybe someone will think I'm just over careful  but I've been in very dark place when I abused strong and great Speed. When time comes and you no more feeling any euphoria even after 5 days break while using very pure and strong Speed at mega dosages then shit man you have big problems with your head.**\n\n\\----------------\n\n**Summing up....**\n\nIt's now 11:30 am. I spend 4 and a half hour writing all of this. Not even sure if anyone will read it at all lol. Just had desire to write about amphetamines from my personal experience. Some of amphetamines are different from each other and they can provide slightly different effects. I also didn't written about amphetamines that could be having similarities like with Yellow Speed effects. In few words they color can be from white to little yellowish, powder is dry, effects can have similarities with Yellow Speed just not as intense. They sharing effects similar to White Amphetamine and Yellow Speed. They seems somewhere in middle. Ah idk there are some things to speak about just no power left to write anymore. Maybe people won't read this at all lol... **I'm not scientist or anything everything that is written is almost from my personal experience and what I learned during my amphetamines abuse.**", "author": "Going_fast_blablabla", "score": 37, "flair": "Stimulants", "created": 1575655630.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/e6wvi1/amphetamines_stimulation_differences_why_same/", "num_comments": 31, "title": "Amphetamines stimulation difference's.

Drugs in general can be unpredictable in how they affect you. With alcohol, I can be euphoric and energetic at times, then with the same amount be depressed and tired. Going into these highs with a positive mindset will always make the high much better. The best way to keep the magic is to plan ahead. Take some time off and hit the gym. Eat a healthy diet.

After a recent scare with a drug test and alcohol, I\u2019ve decided to stop risking my freedom with potentially testing positive with standard drugs and stick to drugs that should generally be safe from testing on probation.

I just want to write. Please just tell me how to fall asleep once I\u2019m home, I don\u2019t have any other drugs to help aside from an edible or two which barely get me high. \n\n.\n\nI took E for the first time with some friends. I haven\u2019t taken any hard drugs in over six months since I last took amphetamine. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t what I expected it to be. I thought I\u2019d be jumping around, on cloud nine. But I spent the past four hours quite calm. When I took amphetamine it was to study but I never got the dosages right so I was over amped every time and never actually studied. This feels like a perfect study buzz. \n\nI\u2019m calm, quiet. I get hot and cold really fast for no reason, I was laying in my friend\u2019s garden getting riddled with mosquito bites but that was better than baking indoors. But then I started shivering so I had to go back inside. \n\nI\u2019m clenching my jaw but not as much as I thought I would. I messaged some people, apologising for things I\u2019d done to some and telling others I love them. My arms and legs aren\u2019t numb per se but if I don\u2019t move them I almost forget that they\u2019re a part of me. \n\nI was with my friend (M!! We\u2019re gonna call him M) on a couch at some point. He loves classical music, Rachmaninoff mostly. So he played a piece and we listened together while we held hands and he rubbed my head, it was really nice. The comforting presence of someone you know wouldn\u2019t hurt you for any reason; that\u2019s really nice to have. It\u2019s like a warm glow coming from someone\u2019s heart. I sound mad fucked but bear with me. \n\nI don\u2019t know what music to listen to right now. I don\u2019t have him with me, my friend. I felt a lot more \u201cstable\u201d with him around but now I\u2019m on a bus alone going home to a parent who\u2019s mad at me for getting back past midnight. \n\n\nThey made me have some water but I didn\u2019t like it. I had maybe five sips and every time I took one I just got queasy. Even thinking about it now makes me feel icky, I don\u2019t understand why. I\u2019m definitely thirsty, my lips are sticking to my teeth and my throat is dry. But the thought of having water is just gross. \n\nOne of my other friends (H? Let\u2019s call him H) with a higher tolerance took two rocks(?) (they were neon green and had no particular shape, so I have no idea how to describe them. Kinda cubical but the edges were rough like it had been poorly broken up). Anyways back to the friend. He threw up while we went on a walk. I hope I don\u2019t get to that point. My mom thinks I\u2019ve only been drinking and she\u2019d kill me if she found out I\u2019ve been taking drugs. \n\nI\u2019m more of a lurker here. I like to read all the harm reduction posts and bartard stories. I have no stories of my own, I don\u2019t usually get high. Yesterday and two days before I spent hotboxing weed with friends in a toolshed, but that\u2019s the most I\u2019ve done recently. The wildest drug story I have is actually from the first time I met M. My school was doing some joint work with the local church for this Christmas celebration, I took music so I had to be in the choir. While we were at rehearsals I got sick of being sober and I bombed some amp in the bathroom. I met M for the first time while I was amped as hell, feeling my heartbeat in my abdominal artery. A mutual friend introduced us but at the timehe just turned away because he didn\u2019t want to get involved with someone high hahaha. Which I can\u2019t really blame him for. But being high on amphetamine in a Church isn\u2019t a great first impression. \n\nI realise I\u2019m rambling here but I don\u2019t really know how to stop. I\u2019m walking home to my apartment and I wish I could stay out later and walk. But it\u2019s dangerous. I\u2019m in a skirt, my town is really sketchy at night. I\u2019m going home anyways. \n\nI realised a lot of my friends think I\u2019m some hardass edgelord druggie that doesn\u2019t care about anything. But I care about a lot. I\u2019m the class metalhead, I\u2019m walking around in my nowhere-near-complete battle jacket. I realise the image I have created for myself isn\u2019t accurate. I\u2019m reflecting on myself as a person and I realise I\u2019m not satisfied with who I am or what I\u2019ve done. I want to be a better person. I kinda wish people knew how much I love DnD and theatre, and baking and taking naps in the sun. I have a whole soft side that I almost never bring up for some reason. Also brb putting my phone in my pocket :D\n\nI\u2019m back I took off my makeup and changed into pajamas. It\u2019s really warm, my fan is all the way up. I\u2019m the kind of person that will sleep with a thick blanket no matter what, not because I\u2019m nuts but because I almost need to feel something holding me to fall asleep. I feel weird without having it over me but I\u2019ll be even warmer then. But I wish M were here. I have a crush on him for some reason. I wish we could listen to music and hold hands some more. Even though I\u2019m warm as hell I\u2019d make that sacrifice for him :) I\u2019m not *in love* but I love him yknow?? I\u2019m attached, I guess. He\u2019s a really fun guy. A good person. \n\nI love this sub so much. You guys are a really fun bunch. I really like reading the essays I see on occasion. Maybe you\u2019re like me. Whoever you are, who\u2019s reading this. I hope you\u2019re getting some level of enjoyment out of this :)\n\n\nI think I\u2019m gonna force myself to stop typing right about now. Theres a lot of things in my life that I\u2019d like to change. I wish I liked getting high more. I enjoy it but theres always a certain point where I start wishing it would just end and I could go back to being sober. I guess I take too much, or maybe shouldn\u2019t take any drugs at all. But right now, as good as I feel. I\u2019m getting sick of the high. I want to sleep, I\u2019m tired. \n\nI\u2019d say goodnight but I\u2019ll probably stay up longer. If you read this far, please let me know and comment. LeAvE A LiKE aNd SuBScRiBE.

Both of you are right and both of you are wrong.\n\nOP has made great progress, and *no one,* not on reddit or anywhere else for that matter, should diminish that. Don't ever let anyone take that away from you OP. Methamphetamine is one fucked up drug, and you should be proud that you threw that junk out of your life. Don't relapse.\n\nkungfusloth88 - I hear what you are saying, but let's be a bit more compassionate. We are all addicts and are susceptible to addiction. Addiction isn't something to be ashamed of. On the contrary, it's very human to be addicted. If a patient suffers from shame out of being an addict, then they will **never** seek help, thus never fully recover from the disease... So, let's not shame them for their choices. Addicts need to replace their chemical imbalance caused by drug abuse with human connection. Only then can they begin to realize what *does* make for a happy life and restructure their neural pathways to suit a life of sobriety with healthier choices. Please, let's not forget that.\n\nBut know this, what kungfusloth88 is trying to say is also correct. OP. You are definitely displaying signs of addiction and don't let the fact that you got the drug from a doctor fool you. A drug is a drug, no matter where you get it from. Vyvanse is still an amphetamine. So, although you may have conquered your meth addiction, Vyvanse isn't that dissimilar to it. Though it is a prescribed medication and has a lesser risk of abuse, it is still a highly controlled substance and (depending on the user) it **can** *still* be abused. Remember, with dopaminergic compounds, the brain will try to *trick and deceive* you at every buck and turn in order to accomplish in getting that high. It will trick you by saying things like, \"I'll get more productive after I dose\" or \"the ideas will start flowing after I dose\", when in reality - after you allow your neurochemistry to rebalance itself through detox - you can accomplish all those things sober.\n\nIt's totally human to be an addict, though. Dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, etc. etc. all these endogenous chemicals **feel fuckin' good**. If you *didn't* get addicted to them, I'd be more surprised at that. That is why it's best *not* to use any drugs, period. Every drug - even ones as seemingly innocuous as chocolate (theobromine) - can develop patterns of thought that alter your behaviour, whether positively or negatively.\n\nHaving said that, if you choose to use, then please research the fuck out of every drug you put into your body and *really* weigh out the pros and cons. With every mind-altering substance, there are **risks** and **gains.** You have to decide for yourself whether or not the gains are worth the risks.\n\n**BE SAFE** and **INVEST** in **TESTING BEFORE INGESTING\\~!**  \u2764", "replies": {"fc4xcka": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/efu6xq/how_to_geek_on_vyvanse/fc4xcka/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1577461232.0, "body": "Reddit isn\u2019t a place for logical / compassionate discussion it\u2019s a place for obese no lifers to shit on others because they hate their own life.

I typically find all amphetamines (even pharmaceutical grade, and even molly and meth) to feel underwhelming and clearheaded. They don\u2019t really \u2018fuck me up\u2019 like coke does. Coke feels more like a classic recreational drug to me and has way more headspace. All amps seem to have a wired tweaky feeling about them, they are *very* stimulating and they make sleeping near impossible and the idea of eating anything seems gross. If you\u2019re a stimulant person I could see why you would like amps more but I\u2019m not really a stim person and I think most people who aren\u2019t stimulant fans tend to prefer coke for this reason specifically. You don\u2019t really \u201ctweak\u201d on blow.\n\nCocaine is nice because it has a honeymoon phase where you can eat right after the high wears off or in some cases even during. And the high and euphoria of cocaine in general seems way better. More exciting and sensual but also more agreeable and smooth. Like a sybaritic high, it\u2019s like a \u201ctreat\u201d almost. You crave it when you\u2019re drunk. One doesn\u2019t crave amphetamines when drinking. If you bust out a pile of amphetamine or bottle full of addys it doesn\u2019t generate the same kind of excitement or lure as cocaine. Coke is just so much more attractive at the end of the day. The other pro is it\u2019s so much easier to get coke, getting quality coke can be a little harder but still easier than obtaining amphetamines ime, unless it\u2019s meth or molly. Coke is also seemingly less neurotoxic than amps.\n\nSome downsides to coke would be the duration of course. Fucked up nose. The crash is terrible at times and it\u2019s very cardiotoxic. You nearly always want more and it\u2019s so compulsive. It can be pricey but there are ways around that (buying in bulk, etc.). However cocaine can usually be fronted if you know the dealer well. Probably isn\u2019t often the case with amps but I could be wrong. Cocaine also seems way less functional, at times it can feel somewhat cognitively psychotic or manic and coming down can make any tedious activity seem infuriating or uncomfortable. Coke is not really a good stimulant for \u201cgoing out\u201d imo despite contrary popular beliefs. Unless of course you\u2019re out at a bar or on the town and you\u2019re already drunk or tipsy on booze. Because coke by itself (which I still prefer) is honestly a fairly isolating drug (in a hedonistic sense) as far as I can tell and I almost always want to be alone on it and half the time I just want to watch fetish porn and jerk off or just chill and watch a movie. It can also make me quiet and feel antisocial in the wrong doses.\n\nAmphetamines wouldn\u2019t do any of this to me. They motivate me to get up and go do things, to be out. They don\u2019t really make me horny either like people say not even molly and meth. I can see how they make being around attractive people fun but overall they make me feel \u201ctoo good\u201d for sex in a sense and make it seem like a waste of time. Amphetamines turn me into what society wants and coke essentially does the opposite. The downside to this is that amphetamines also have this dehumanizing effect where you can feel less human, more numb I guess. Hard to explain but basically like Christian Bale in American Psycho. Most violent porn and sadism on the internet and dark web I feel is probably connected to meth or amphetamines in some way. Because at a certain point normal sex, even hardcore sex isn\u2019t enough. I\u2019ve never been down that road with amps but I\u2019m just highlighting the dehumanizing quality.\n\nI find coke makes people way nicer than amps, at least during the initial rush, then it diverges into almost the opposite where you feel more manic and annoyed at things. Coke though at the end of the day (if it\u2019s good quality) seems fairly appetizing for a drug, not overly stimulating and has this unparalleled \u2018rockstar\u2019 feeling or excitement about it that\u2019s very unique. That\u2019s essentially what I\u2019m paying for. Also coke can have somewhat pleasant afterglows I\u2019ve noticed. Mostly another honeymoon phase thing however. Coke has a groovy feeling that you don\u2019t really get with other stims basically. Never been a stim fan but always enjoyed coke.", "replies": {"g65tcoc": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/irnpwj/coke_vs_amphetamine_make_your_case_here/g65tcoc/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1600759414.0, "body": "Ton of great points you made.

Or maybe i'm just a dumbass. At noon on thursday, I snorted the first line, burnt like hell, the burn pissed me off so I snorted another out of spite. I subsequently forgot that i read it took a few minutes to kick in snorting, so 30 minutes later I was about to explode. It wasn't very euphoric, though, just kinda felt like I was having a panic attack without the emotional breakdown. I felt hyper energized but my mind couldn't catch up with my thought patterns. There was probably 20% enjoyment, 80% \"woah this is unpleasant.\" So much anxiety.  This state of unpleasant stimulation lasted about 10 hours. I did not redose, because I naively thought i'd be able to sleep that night (like I can on adderall, etc). Tweakers are probably laughing at me. I laid in bed, sweating, heart blasting, staring at the ceiling, then the walls, then the ceiling. again. for about 4 hours. It was obvious that sleep was quite out of the question.\n\n Then i began to feel the crippling emotional distress of the comedown. Depression, apathy, shame, sickness. I, being addicted to instant gratification, thought:  \"well, i'm starting to crash hard, so I guess i could level it out with a little crystal so I can be productive today.\" I think this is meth's quintessential pitfall: you need more meth to get over how shitty meth makes you feel, and the nature of stimulants makes it absurdly easy to justify redosing. \n\nSo I did another line. Instead of getting a hint of euphoria (which was all i was hoping for), I just got super amped up, anxious, twichy, sweaty, and actually kinda felt worse.  I will say, it would make me a productive worker, but I'd feel miserable doing it. Anyway that was yesterday around 10 AM. Did that line, went out and did stuff more or less functionally, then did another key bump around 1 PM yesterday. that was my last dose.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, as I've monitored this unpleasant comedown, I was stuck by a few realizations:\n\n* **My penis seems to have inverted itself.** I swear, it looks like most of it has retracted into my body. It's so unnerving that I really want to post a picture, but I'm afraid someone will report me for child pornography. SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO FIX MY DICK. One of the biggest things I was hyped for meth was jacking off. With this minuscule protuberance, I would be able to jack off with two fingers. Holding my dick looks kind of like if you were holding an acorn between your thumb and forefinger. please help me fix my dick. I am woefully average sized normally and I just want it back!\n\n* **How the fuck do any of you tweakers sleep**? Seriously? No sleep for 24-48 hours after one dose? I can always knock myself out after mdma, adderall, and coke, but this was insomnia on a level I've never comprehended. It is the opposite of sleep. I love sleeping because i'm depressed, so I can't  fathom why people would do this regularly. \n\n* along the same lines,  **how the fuck do any tweakers nourish themselves**? I have not been able to eat anything in 48 hours. nothing. I can drink water  but it sucks. I can feel my body struggling against empty hunger but the thought of food revolts me. I have never wanted food less in my life. Who the fuck lives like this, and how? This is not even on the same planet as adderall's \"well, I don't have much of an appetite, but I take care of my body so I gotta eat\". This is a complete and fundamental rejection of all food and nourishment. \n\n*  Oh my god my fucking jaw and my teeth hurt like hell.\n\n* At one point I thought: \"it feels like I snorted drain cleaner\". then I realized I probably did.\n\nOverall, it's been 24 hours since my last dose and I feel predictably like shit. My body is still sweating madly. I haven't slept. I'm starving but I can't eat anything. My vision feels blurred, my circulation is quite poor. Did I mention I'm sweating like a priest at a playground? \n\nI feel my body fighting against the consequences of the amphetamines and I'm ready for it to stop. \n\nBut here's the weirdest thing: I still have a pretty significant part of me that wants to redose. It's bizarre, because I know objectively that I really didn't enjoy myself, but there is a dopamine receptor in my brain that was obvious activated and my brain wants to feed the monkey. This shit is insidious! I get why people become addicted, even though again I did **not** enjoy myself.  Maybe it would be different if I had been able to masturbate. I think it probably would have, actually. \n\nAnyone have an idea when I'll start feeling normal? I'm definitely coming down hard, but I'm still super amped up and stimulated. Fuuuuck this shit.

well, it would be. however...\n\ni cannot seem to get local pharmacies to take my request (even when signed by prescriber) to not substitute different generics at all seriously. this has been a major problem in the past, as i\u2019ve once been given a goddawful version that i guess is packed w sugar for unethical parents to foist on their kids, and also struggled for a few months fairly recently when rite-aid abruptly swapped from aurobindo to montuklast, the latter of which did not work literally at all, and also gave me some severe gastric pain! yay. so i got my prescriber to request what i had been most recently taking, got told they had an exclusive contract now, and subsequently switched pharmacies... only to have them not fill it as requested either by the second month. but hey! it wasn\u2019t as bad. so whatever right? \n\nyeah, maybe not. \n\nsee, the thing is, for the last almost a year or even more, i\u2019ve been in and out of some of the worst depressive episodes of my life. the last few months (incidentally, this timeline of decline overlaps p much exactly w the montuklast debacle!) have been particularly bad, and - with a notable exception i\u2019ll get to shortly - just keep getting worse. all of this i\u2019ve chalked up to societal unheavals, a major friend betrayal, and some digging back up of a serious personal trauma though, which would all be enough to trigger a bad state for anyone, especially someone with bipolar. \n\nand then four days ago, i misplaced my currently bottle of adderall, and, failing to locate it, opted to dig into my little apothecary box o\u2019 forgotten &amp; unused pills, and take some (corepharma) from back in march 2018 that showed up behind a bookshelf in a recent housecleaning effort. i figured it might not be as effective, given its age, but also that my refill date was only a few days off, and i would vastly prefer to have something to tide me over. \n\nwhat i did not expect was for it to work way, way better. \n\nlike, two weeks ago i went full 2007 britney level of mental breakdown, and for, wow whaddya know, basically the last two years or so, i have been deeply unmotivated, unstable, and depressed. so much so that my identity had begun to crumble due to not being able to produce any art hardly at all for a period longer than i have ever experienced literally for my entire life. so much so that i\u2019ve lost friends due to my inaction and just general not-fun-to-be-around-ness. not even major positive changes or events have budged me much, and i\u2019ve found it extremely difficult to have any hope for the future whatsoever. oh yeah, and i\u2019ve gained like, 40 pounds, which has super been great for my self esteem also!\n\nso, with that backdrop, cut to three days ago, and i not only cleaned a bunch, and made dinner, just, like a normal goddamn person, but i also filled three pages in my sketchbook, and went to bed that morning (yeah, yeah, i know, whatever though, time\u2019s fake and i\u2019m a night person) feeling for the first time in fucking months like i didn\u2019t want to sleep - and if i had to, like i was happy to know i would wake up again. \n\nthe day after, i had a date at home w my partner, mailed a package that i shit you not i have had sitting in my house for at least six months, drew more, and swept the house, all of my own volition. and i felt fucking great! wow! finally, mania\u2019s back babey!! \n\ncut to waking up the next day (yesterday), taking my adderall, immediately hopping up, having another pretty good day. i went on a walk w my partner, worked on a project together, and then, when he went to lay down \u201cjust for a little while\u201d, i decided to surprise him by going out into the garden w a headlamp and gardening the shit outta that thing until he came back out to join me. \n\ni wound up gardening for about seven and a half hours straight, bc he, of course, fell asleep. i only stopped by my fingernails literally started shredding, and once i did, i finally realised how much searing, throbbing pain i was in, and also how hungry i was. but also? i felt genuinely proud, happy, and not even upset that he hadn\u2019t gotten up when he\u2019d said he would. suffice it to say these feelings are pretty unfamiliar to me at this point. \n\nso i went inside, took a bath, and finally passed tf out. \n\nit\u2019s been more than 12 hours since, and despite the minor gardening injuries, i still feel great. even physically i\u2019m in less pain than i have been in ages. \n\nso... what the fuck! i\u2019ve done the research enough to know just how different various generics and formulations can be, and how much it can mess people up. i thought i knew the extent of that, bc of how much clearly worse the montuklast was for me. now though, i\u2019m just mad. i don\u2019t get how this can be legal, when it can have such an obvious and profound difference from one formulation to another. \n\nif they didn\u2019t come in the same marked prescription bottles, i honestly don\u2019t think i would even identify them as the same drug at all, even if they looked identical (they\u2019re similar, but they do not). \n\neverything feels different. everything feels /better/. \n\nso just... what the fuck. and has anyone else had a similar experience? specifically someone with bipolar - as i have read similar anecdotes about depression from people w just, well, depression - but all experiences welcome. \n\ni\u2019m getting my therapist on board to advocate for me, to help make sure i stop getting bad generics, bc i\u2019m definitely convinced by now that they\u2019re the problem, so i guess i\u2019m probably good in the long run. just... fuck, right? i almost fucking killed myself! more than once! i ran multiple relationships into the ground and wasted more than a year of my damn life! and now i\u2019m finding out it may well be bc some asshole somewhere made a new pharma contract deal to line some other assholes\u2019 goddamn pockets, leading to my goddamn prescription being suddenly and silently filled w garbage? i feel so fucked over, it\u2019s just, unreal. four days ago, i seriously thought suicide was becoming a when and not an if, because i no longer remembered what it felt like to be internally motivated or consistent in my own thoughts or actions. if i had never had to use an old bottle \u201cto tide my self over\u201d, or never had it, that \u201cwhen\u201d might have been soon. i\u2019m just... blown away. even having sore muscles feels good again! \n\nanyway. it feels good, to vent, and in general. but gd, what a sick fucking joke.\n\nbig pharma can go to hell. these formulas & their distribution shouldn\u2019t be beholden to private shareholders and whoever can scam their way into a patent, and the products shouldn\u2019t be walled off behind egregious costs. for all the hell this has caused me, at least i\u2019ve had the coverage for any meds in the first place! burn it the hell down, tbh.", "author": "greensighted", "score": 1, "flair": "Stimulants", "created": 1592843130.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hdocaa/a_generic_horror_story_adderall_bipolar/", "num_comments": 18, "title": "a generic horror story: adderall, (bipolar) depression, and how my pharmacy may have nearly ruined my life", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fvmtuxt": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/hdocaa/a_generic_horror_story_adderall_bipolar/fvmtuxt/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1592860208.0, "body": "Not bipolar but my friend swears that different generics of adderall suck.

And you know what. Nothing happened.\n\nI did normal dose at home with friends.\n\nNot saying mdma is safe or anything. But just so you know.\n\nCocaine, speed, amps, meth and adhd meds effect on the heart is definitely lot lot lot more than mdma. Tho lots of mdma pills contain speed, even pma. Thus making it deadly.

But no i am not addicted\nLast time i took my medication was a year ago. When i didn't know about my heart issue (which isn't very serious btw, the operation actually caused issues whatever).\n\nI really had to take my med to finish my project. Because iam unemployed for so long and i didn't want to fuck this up. Yeah i risked my life on it knowing. But that's the decision making on adhd. Also the peer pressure of being unemployed. Plus the lock down.\n\nI accept it.\n\nWhatever nothing happened. Also my rhythm didn't get fucked too thanks god. Just mild tachycardia (130 bpm for 3.5 hours).\n\nI won't do adhd meds again. Actually i don't even drink coffee.\n\nI am not addicted. But yes, i changes 3 high-schools. Graduating from engineering in 4 years was a miracle, comparing i almost didn't study at all(couldn't). I know i sound like an average Joe stupid Jack ass. But i realised i wasn't when i did my medication. I never knew my capacity.\n\nSo i am kind of a waste, shame of the family. Full of potential but can't initiate. If you study severe adhd, you will understand why. Studying learning is like a friend asking me to let's climb a skyscraper with bare hands. I won't go into details but simply the brain is hard wired to sense less dopamine levels, not stimulated networks, it won't give you the green light. Because your own brain thinks its impossible to complete, achieve. So you are extremely unmotivated, and with force after 5 minutes of trying you realise you can't even read the sentence.\n\nIt's actually pretty neuroscience, neurotransmitter bined issue.\n\nI am a dumb shit. But when i am medicated i am a genius. That's the dramatic difference. Its very hard to accept the limiting factor, its like a disability.\n\nMy own brain won't give access to short term memory, oh yeah go study physics math programming. You can't.\n\nI struggled too much already. But i am no addicted. I used 2 bottles only for finals etc, on my senior year else wise i wouldn't be graduating...

I\u2019m very experienced with MDMA last summer I was doing it at least once every 2 weeks usually dosing at 0.2 but occasionally would redose an hour later. \n\nI got the psychological symptoms for sure from my 3 month long binge so I decided to cut back to once every month at the most but I usually spread it out by 2 or 3 months. Since I was doing molly this time only for a few months &amp;amp;amp; since I haven\u2019t done it in 3 months I decided it would be smart to take a 0.2 and then redose the rest of the 0.3 about 2 hours into my roll. It didn\u2019t feel as magical as last time I did it and I only took a 0.2 last time. \n\nStarting literally right when I was coming down from my peak I started to get these feelings in my head and neck (I\u2019m assuming from what I\u2019ve read people describe they\u2019re brain zaps) but also felt kind of like my body is on the verge of jerking. Kind of like when you have a dream you\u2019re falling and you jerk up that\u2019s how it feels. I\u2019ve also had no appetite since then but I have forced myself to eat something for replenishment.\n\nI also have difficulty typing correctly on my phone I am relying heavily on autocorrect and I still am getting super frustrated how weird it feels. When I\u2019m smoking weed I keep feeling like I\u2019m gonna fall backwards and sometimes I almost do and right at the last second my brain decides to work and catch myself. I\u2019m not having warping visuals but my vision is not 20/20 I am definitely still in a very trippy state. My muscles are also ACHING I was almost at the point of screaming earlier because it hurts whether I lay down or stand up because my neck, legs, abdomen and back are so sore and tight. My feet tingle but it\u2019s kind of a burning tingle like they\u2019re cold but they aren\u2019t. \n\nWell guys, I think this is my body telling me to stop doing MDMA. I know it was dumb to redose the other 0.3 and I probably should have just taken the 0.3 first, but I figured 0.2 would make me feel at least comparable to 3 months ago so I was trying to intensify my roll. I am going to wait 6 months and see if the magic is back and the lasting effects are gone. Before I thought  MDMA was a medicine (which it is in a way) that you could abuse and take as often as you want and you would only get the mental side effects, I never thought I would be in this much pain and discomfort from a drug.

Never liked psychedelics as I almost always had bad trips. Im also a very occasional weed smoker, so my tolerance is low \n\nLast night I had a really weird experience that I'm still struggling to comprehend. Nothing bad happened, and it wasn't even THAT scary while it was going on, just very weird. I'm hoping someone can shed some insight.\n\nLast night I had a digital happy hour with a friend of mine where we had some drinks, did a few bumps of coke, and shot the shit. A little later in the night a couple other friends joined. I probably had 6 drinks, and 5-6 bumps of coke (no lines), all in all not a whole lot. My roommate is a big pot smoker and at some point in the call he came into the room and offered me a hit from his weed pen. I'd never smoked weed from a pen, he warned me it was pretty strong and to only take one hit, which I did. Then I went back to the call. Was on the call for another hour or so, feeling solidly drunk and lightly energetic from the coke, but couldn't really feel any effects of weed. \n\nWhen the call ended I wanted to go to sleep, but was still feeling a bit too amped up. I went back out to the living room where my roommate was still smoking. Told him I wasn't really feeling high. He says to take one more big hit from the pen and hold it in my lungs for a few seconds. Did that.\n\nThe second hit INSTANTLY FLOORED me. I felt higher than id been in a long time. I carried on a conversation for a minute or two with my roommate, but quickly started realizing that I had NO idea what he was saying. I went to sit down on the couch. He was still talking, but it was like words had lost all meaning. He was saying absolute nonsense that I couldn't believe he was actually saying. Now here's where it gets even weirder... I was RESPONDING verbally, and the words I said made NO sense either. It was like words were leaving my mouth that my brain didn't come up with. From his body language, laughter, etc I could tell that my verbal communication was still normal. Nothing I was saying was confusing or alarming him. I just had NO idea what was going on.\n\nEventually I started saying to my roommate that I was too high and couldn't understand what he was saying. I (think?) I told him that I was starting to get freaked out. Now here's where it gets even weirder - he responds, and I have NO idea what the words he said mean..like literally can't understand them at all...but the message he was getting across was the I was going to be okay, it's just weed, it would go away in 30 mins.. somehow I understood the message perfectly without understanding any of the words. In order to calm my anxiety, I decided to take a .5 mg dose of Xanax. I know, not the best combination with alcohol and coke, but it was a very small dose and I was having what I'd describe as a mild panic attack.\n\nI decided to go for a walk around the block to kill some time and calm my thoughts. I HAVE NO RECOLLECTION WHATSOEVER of that walk. I remember getting up to walk, putting on my shoes...then nothing. I came back inside and sat back on the couch and my roommate was talking to me again about some random shit. Suddenly I think to myself...did I actually just go outside for a walk? Or did I imagine that? I asked my roommate that question and he says that yes, I really did go for a walk and was gone for about 30 mins. \n\nAt this point I realized that I'm starting to be able to understand words again (though they still seem really strange) and the Xanax is probably starting to kick in, so I decided to go to bed. Don't remember much after that. \n\nThe next morning I asked my roommate what the hell happened... He said I was carrying on a perfectly normal conversation. Then I started to say I was too high, didn't know what was going on, was kinda starting to freak out. Apparently, to convince me I was fine, he actually started QUIZZING me on the definitions of words. For instance, he asked me what a banana was, and I responded its a yellow fruit. Then he'd be like... See, you DO understand words. But in the moment it was happening, I had no idea what was being said or that I was being quizzed. \n\nI've never had a reaction like that from weed, unless psychedelics have also been involved. I really don't like psychedelics because I hate losing control of my own senses and perceptions, which is kind of what happened last night. I don't want something like that to happen again... Like I said I'm a pretty moderate weed smoker but I've definitely smoked more weed than last night on other occasions (multiple bong rips, full joints, etc). I know the pen is supposed to be very concentrated but I only took TWO hits of it. \n\nStill not really sure what to make of this experience..again it wasn't that terrible (I've had much worse freakouts on bad trips), but it was unpleasant to say the least. I'm wondering if I should stay away from weed for a while...\n\nTl;dr I got drunk and did a few bumps of coke, then took two hits of a weed pen and had a really weird, slightly scary psychedelic experience.

In a way it sounds like Pree-Sisters Swallowing a Donkey - Neutral Milk Hotel but less sinister. Sometimes things will gradually get louder and louder/quieter and quieter, and it happens in intervals. It can feel like dying in a way, but I've learned to accept it. Also happens with light, darker or lighter. \n\n**Perspective shifts and Visuals**, I can see the world more 3D like in a way, and how I did when I was younger. With that I start seeing eyes and or things become more fuzzy looking, as if it is made out of energy. It can be overwhelming especially with the eyes, if I am in a good mind set then the eyes usually overlay on top of things, especially in shadows. I become more creative if the trip is good, I usually feel like I am in different places, such as a war or going off to fight a dragon. There's the common perception that everything looks laggy and sometimes for me, things look extremely fluid and fast. Sometimes people look like there skin is separating from them and this dark underlay is holding them together. Things can take on a very cartoonish look while I am high, which is really fun. I also ALWAYS get the mental visual that I am a running emoji man travelling across an infinitely long field, running and becoming apart of the air around it and opening (the opening is a feeling). A lot of the times things become ultra HD (like jumping from 1080 to 4k) typically in the middle of the peak then go back down as the peak rises (idk why). Same thing happened on LSD for me too. Sometimes it can be enlightening. In my mind everything looks strangely opaque and ugly in color, it's very strange because on LSD everything in my mind is pastel and beautiful, with weed I get perspective inside my perspective, idk how to explain that other than that. If I analyze things my mind wanders into strange looking places and the colors aren't bothersome, I just don't understand why they always look so ugly (maybe it's the strain). \n\n**I feel sounds** when I am very high, rarely do I see sounds but it has happened before. Taste hasn't been effected once. My body feels very far away from my mind. I get mind visuals, usually of idk traveling through stars, and it can get very dark (as in color) or light it's very strange to me, it's like running through a star system. Sometimes I get a euphoric body high but that is occasionally, I think the strain has more to do with why I don't. \n\n**Lights take on a whole new meaning**, like they can be aliens or look like stars, etc, idk whatever my brain thinks. Branches of trees stick out a lot more and feel like they're poking into my vision (in a way), they can look like universal webs but also be very overwhelming at times. I can get delusional at times, thinking that I am seeing things vividly but usually that's due to shadows, and I calm down.\n\n**My thoughts race super fast**, so fast that I can't catch up, it's like my mind is having a conversation with itself, the longest conversation EVER, and I become either very talkative of nonsense, or quiet. Most times I switch in between depending on the setting. I say random things that I call names like Amp (that is the name given to my sober by the rest of my brain on weed), names such as Dabwabwa, Amb, and Hamp and many more weird names come out. Idk what they mean but they are interesting and usually appear on a good trip. Sometimes I see actual things, like all the time I get this map in my head, it looks like a pixelated board floating in a sea of nothingness. Usually I feel like I have a quest when I am high so that may be why. It's very visual in my mind. On occasion my mind goes flat, and calm but usually I feel more energized!\n\n**Touch has a whole new meaning**, I rub my hands over my legs/surrounding a lot, things feel very hard  ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) pinny even and more defined, it's not very comfortable at all actually, like I wanted to cuddle up with my cover but it felt like cloth made of stones!! Cold and hot becomes meaningless. Once I felt like my chest and throat were made completely out of jelly, and jiggling and I could see it in my head, it was blue and looked like a quantum tunnel. \n\n**I have met  one entity while high**, he was really cool, and for some reason I knew this guy, it was like we were friends forever and I was just so happy to meet him again, even though that was the first time it'd ever happened. He looks weird,  like a man with a carton for a head, he wore a casual suit and blinked back and forth from me and back. Note that I could not see him physically, he was a mental thing. I tried to introduce my friend to him but he went away, I wish I could talk to that guy again, but I would have to be in a great relaxed mood I believe. I call it an entity because it reacted with my in such a way that I'd have to be delusion to talk to it, Idk. \n\nI've learned, usually if I am having a challenging high, it's because I am not moving, when I move it clears my mind from the chaos that ensues, and it becomes more calm and happy. Setting really matters tho! Like I hate getting high in cars in places where I find fishy. I like getting high in the woods around a fire in spring weather. That's where I've had the best highs. Also I love it with people, I don't like being alone high, I find it boring and all the energy needs to go somewhere.

I began raiding the cupboards until I found a white box containing some gravol (75 mg) and 400mg of Benadryl (16 pills) I grabbed a large bottle of water as from previous experiences I recognised they were hard to swallow and tasted horrendous I began poppin' and swallowing after 10 minutes I began feeling extremely paranoid to the point I was thinking telling my parents but I overcame it and decided just to stay calm.\n\n20 minutes passed my heart rate has increased and as Benadryl also work as sleeping pills I began to get really tired a tiredness that's unexplainable I didn't own the energy to talk or to even move whenever my parents talked to me I made groaning noises when my parents asked \"what is wrong with you\" I simply replied with \"I'm tired\" a straight lie.\n\n30 minutes passed and the hallucinations began to kick in 475 mg is a relatively high dose so I expected vivid hallucinations. It began with bugs which is very common when taking dramines (I speak from personal experiences) it started with flys buzzing around a light I tried to shoo them but they simply vanished into thin air the next bit (and the worst part of the trip) were fat black spiders EVERYWHERE a huge one was on my leg but lacking the energy needed to rid the spider it just stayed there and as mentioned previously It's delirious so I strongly believed that they were real eventually I managed to make them dissappear.\n\nAfter the bug trip I thought it would be best to go to bed (it's around 11) \nAs soon as I stood up I just feel as if my knee cap disintegrated it was horrifying I managed to make it up the stairs but while brushing my teeth I looked in the mirror and my face was just distorted like looking in one of those funky mirrors and again I believed it was real so I had to touch my face to finally azure my self.\n\nNow this is the worst bit about Benadryl if you exceed the limit sleeping pills have the opposite effect they keep you up for the entire night so I just started to play on my phone but this was the fucking scary bit it just melted in my hands and each minute as the drug causes memory loss I would again hallucinate it was there and again it would melt into my hands I wanted to jump out my skin I was so uncomfortable. I was having rapid twitching\n\nAt about 1:00 am (this is when the major hallucinations began) I was looking out my window when two space ships appeared but I could only see them in my paripheal vision as soon as I directly look at them they disappear. Then a mothership appeared that dwarfed everything I tried to take a photo but again my phone melted. This is the part where I almost got caught looking down at my patio from my window there was a chair but I envisioned as a deer I immediately got my dad and said to him as horses used to break into our garden so too me it was believable my dad was awake and I said to my dad but I pulled it off as tiredness.\n\nJust as I start drifting off to sleep my jumper that was resting on my guitar amp started personifying itself, It started developing a face and stared straight at me I was terrified. My bag that was hanging on my door handle also developed hands and made a motion with its hands trying to get me to go towards it I was done at that point I simply wanted it all to go away I shut my eyes but even then flashes of blinding light stopped me from sleeping.\n\nIt must of been 5 o clock before I slept the next day was one of the worst days of my life I was depressed I was having dependence issues and I started getting restless leg syndromes where I had random spasms.\n\nIn conclusion if you should never ever try this drug.

At this point despite it being roughly 2:30 I was still getting very minimal visuals, a substantial bit of symmetrical vision but not so much any classic lsd visuals I typically have. Then we decided we could go for a walk up a hill that we had walked up the day prior, the walk was roughly 25 mins each way to where there was a spot we rested at at the end each time. While the walk probably did take 25 while tripping it definitely felt a lot longer than the first time going up and the physical aspect of walking definitely amped up the trippy-ness. \n\nSo we get to the top of where we were aiming which was where suddenly in the middle of forest on either side for ages there was a huge clearing with a big sloping field. We got to a point where there was a big log that was above all of the tall grass, we sat there and looked down on an absolutely awesome view of rolling hills, little farm houses and just a generally perfect day. \n\nAt this point we decided we could do a few nangs (NOS, Whippets), before we started he walk back down. Keep in mind by now this was around 3 and a bit hours into the trip so it definitely was ramping up but I still wasn\u2019t having any majorly apparent visuals so I thought it might kick things up a notch.\n\nThis is the point where if went south. I was the first to have a nang and as it started all was good but as I started coming around and regaining awareness I could feel an intense feeling of dread. Due to the minimal nature of the visuals I really couldn\u2019t tell that I was tripping and at this point had forgot I took a nang as well. As a result I looked back over to my other friends and they were all frozen. \n\nThe best way I have been able to remember it in my own head was by describing it like this:\n\nYou know when you are looking at one spot for a long time and you sort of fill in the area in your peripheral (for example you may see a clock in your peripheral vision but you can\u2019t actually read anything on it, it\u2019s just your brain filling in gaps with information it knows.) this was kind of the case with the nang. As I was regaining consciousness I looked over and it was if my peripheral vision was locked into place so I could see them all sitting there with balloons inflating randomly in their mouths constantly while they were talking. And then they started looking at me and laughing and snickering amongst themselves which to me seemed like these were the entities that were trapping me in this virtual world. \n\n( I ALSO WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THEY WERE DOING NOTHING MEAN OR INSIDIOUS TOWARDS ME IN REAL LIFE THIS WAS ALL IN MY HEAD ) \n\nAt this point I have figured out that something is not right and that what I\u2019m experiencing isn\u2019t real but I didn\u2019t know why because I didn\u2019t know I was tripping and had had a nang. I started yelling at them and moving over to them and like grabbing them (again all in my head) and screaming at them but they just laughed and inflated more balloons.  I also had an experience of walking right up to them and them sounding like they were trapped behind a painting, I could smear and touch them but they wouldn\u2019t react and I could still hear them talking and laughing.\n\nAt this point I somehow remembered I was tripping, probably because the nang was running out of time being effective in the real world even though it had felt like hours. So I tried reaching into my bum bag that I took on the walk that I had kept a Xanax in just in case anyone was having a bad time. \n\nBut when I tried to open it the zipper just wouldn\u2019t open no matter how hard I tried (realistically in hindsight it was because I was tripping really hard and In the tail end of a nang). Finally I managed to get it open but then I couldn\u2019t pull the baggie out of my bum bag, so at this point I fully freaked out because I thought I was hallucinating all of that as well and that he reason I couldn\u2019t access it was because this was a fake world and the Xanax, my bum bag and everything else didn\u2019t really exist. All of the things that occurred during the nang felt infinite and like I was the joke at the centre of some evil simulation.\n\nI then stood up again and started yelling at my friends \u201cis this real is this real\u201d and at this point the nang had finally worn off and they were really stunned because I had just been sitting there chilling out and then suddenly jumped up and was freaking out. \n\nAfter this point it took me around an hour to begin to be able to distinguish what was real and fake. I was very close to taking a Xanax at many points throughout this experience but am glad I saved it until right when I wanted to sleep as I feel like a confronted one of the most interesting experiences of my life.\n\nI had many other very interesting visuals on the comedown but nothing came close to the vidid and surreal nature of that experience\n\nThanks for long read. \n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/3CD2Sio", "author": "Yeni_", "score": 8, "flair": "Psychedelics", "created": 1580985131.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ezlahq/the_worst_and_most_interesting_trip_of_my_life/", "num_comments": 11, "title": "The worst and most interesting trip of my life", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fgoj4ri": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/ezlahq/the_worst_and_most_interesting_trip_of_my_life/fgoj4ri/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1581000691.0, "body": "yeah man nitrous while on other stuff is wild haha.

But as I was walking through my living room I literally blacked out. I was walking, and then I was sitting on a chair. I was almost going in and out of consciousness ?? Or forgetting the last few seconds so it felt like I had anyway?? This happened for a while , and I was completely gone - my mind was just gone. I then zoned back in again and words and thoughts came back and I was like oh i\u2018m high .  It\u2019s like I died and came back to life, and had to make sense of the world again. My surroundings were flashing like strobe lighting. Everything was drifting aswell, like when you spin in a circle for ages and stop and the world keeps moving around you . I was unbelievably dizzy, and felt like I was about to seize up. My friend was sitting next to me and I was hugging her \u201cim so scared I don\u2019t like this\u201d (must\u2019ve looked like a bit of a pussy tbh). I was completely out of control. Anyway this extreme reaction went on for about 5 mins before I took a little control over it. I got up and tried to dance , but a wave of this strobe lighting and dizziness and drifting hit me again, and I had to sit down again. \nI finally decided to go on a walk, but while getting ready I seemed to be stuck in time for some moments . Time was distorted, and I\u2019d often forget what was happening & then realise what was happening again? Like I\u2019d be having a conversation and I\u2019d zone out into nothingness before zoning back in.  I also felt very sick..This lasted for a few hours. Was horrible.\n\n\nNORmAL WEEe\nAnyway, I tried some weed again a few weeks later. It was good for the first 5 mins, but then suddenly it hit me. I needed to sit down. And then I blacked out, and came back. Everything was flashing black, everything was spinning . Was awful. Had to sit down and watch pepper pig for a good hour before being able to stand back up lol.

And yes, I know, very stupid and I\u2019m lucky to not only still be alive despite everything I did that night but also have no long-term damage either afaik, but it was a pretty shitty time in my life back then for a variety of very unpleasant reasons so I guess I just really didn\u2019t care at the time since my mental health was going downhill fast and I was making some pretty bad lifestyle choices fairly consistently.\n\nAnyway, while the comedown was god awful and I looked like I\u2019d been dead for at least a couple days by the time I was completely sober and was still high hours and hours later, the come-up and peak were both still fucking AMAZING. I didn\u2019t realize at the time that you don\u2019t really get a seemingly infinite amount of energy as well as that euphoric feeling of \u201cI\u2019m the best person in the whole universe and if you disagree with me then fuck you, I don\u2019t care\u201d on just molly alone, which would explain why I was the only person on the entire dance floor practically jumping two fucking feet off the goddamn ground and nearly bumping into people, dancing somewhat longer than most of everyone there and not being able to stop talking even when I wanted to all because of how much shit I still had active in my system.\n\nNow, my question is this: is there ANY safe way to do this sort of thing again or will the comedown be horrible once more no matter what I do, and if it is in fact safe, how would I go about doing this and what drug specifically would give me these results? Obviously, not with NEARLY that ridiculously high of an amount but still with something on the stronger side in terms of dosage and effects. For reference, the comedown effects I experienced that night were: severe dehydration to the point where I couldn\u2019t even piss anymore, chewing my lips so much that the first layer of skin on them was completely gone and took about a whole week to heal, increasingly worse anxiety/paranoia, couldn\u2019t shut the fuck up even when I tried, couldn\u2019t sleep all night and was hungry af but I don\u2019t think I actually ate almost anything because I just didn\u2019t care enough to do so. Can\u2019t remember if my balls were shrunken or not since I\u2019ve read that that\u2019s a sign you have legit amps but they probably were.\n\nIf I can get a roll that energetic with MDMA, I assume it\u2019d have to be at least 150 mg. with a 50 or even 75 mg. redose since I just did 150 mg. tonight without a redose and while it was great for three hours, that was about all it lasted before I started coming down, so would either a redose or just doing something heavy like 200 mg. all at once give me another hour or so of a solid peak?\n\nIf it\u2019s really only safely possible through amps, I have a shitload of Vyvanse and I could try out like 100 mg. or so of that at first, unless Vyvanse isn\u2019t strong enough and I\u2019d need like Adderall or something more potent instead? I\u2019ve done 70 mg. of Vyvanse a couple times but it was more moderate than I expected as opposed to heavy and something I could see myself dancing on.\n\nHowever, if the level of euphoria and energy I had that night sounds like it was closer to meth than either molly or amps then I\u2019m not even going to bother trying another \u201chigh energy roll\u201d like that one again since I don\u2019t want to go down that particular road with meth.\n\nIf you made it all the way to the end here then thank you very much for reading this whole thing and please, let me know what you think in your replies if you have any solid advice either way. The more details, the better. :)\n\nEDIT: Just realized I forgot an important detail: tonight, I hit my wax pen only like 45 minutes into the roll because I read that it supposedly makes it better so maybe I should\u2019ve waited until the comedown to do that instead and that was actually the reason why the roll didn\u2019t last as long?", "author": "schlockhat", "score": 8, "flair": "Stimulants", "created": 1601824853.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/j4uxh6/is_there_any_way_to_safely_get_another_very/", "num_comments": 10, "title": "Is there any way to SAFELY get another very energetic roll/high like the one I had almost a year ago?

While I admittedly do have a desire to get that same energy back for one hell of a night and know where to look for good meth if I really wanted it, I\u2019d probably end up getting hooked on it because of how highly addictive it is and even if I don\u2019t, the side effects and comedown are the worst I\u2019ve ever had compared to any other drug, even worse than the worst hangover I ever had after drinking so much hard liquor that I blacked out the night before and felt like complete shit the next day.\n\nThanks for the recommendation though, never heard of 3-MMC before but then again, I\u2019m not really a RC kind of guy nor a stim guy either so idk as much about them compared to other drugs like weed and hallucinogens since those tend to be more my thing. I\u2019ve seen some people say 4-MMC (mephedrone) is pretty similar to 3-MMC but better overall and just generally harder to find. If I could get my hands on some, how do you think that that would compare to meth in terms of chances of addiction and side effects/comedowns?\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve found, although the comedowns could definitely suck, I feel like as long as I prepare for it days in advance by eating healthier, stopping certain meds/supplements and replacing them with other ones temporarily (e.g. 5-HTP, EGCg, etc.) and stay hydrated during the high itself then the comedown should be fine because I\u2019ve been having nothing but a great comedown on the molly I did last night even though I\u2019ve seen plenty of reports here of people who\u2019ve had the exact opposite experience, and that was a fairly moderate dose of VERY pure stuff too so would it be possible to have a good time on like a mild-to-moderate dose of mephedrone without a shitty comedown like on MDMA or is it the kind of stim where that\u2019s unfortunately not really possible for almost anyone like it is just about universally for meth?", "replies": {"g7ooo3o": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/j4uxh6/is_there_any_way_to_safely_get_another_very/g7ooo3o/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1601852251.0, "body": "Yeah definitely don't do meth again, it'll feel great but the risk of addiction just isn't worth it imo. \n\nI recommended 3-MMC over 4-MMC because it's easier to find (for me at least) and feels less damaging than 4-MMC, although it's true 4-MMC feels a lot stronger. \n4-MMC is probably not gonna be as bad as meth regarding addiction and comedowns, but it's still a dangerous substance and should be taken with caution. Compulsive redosing is a known issue because every redose can have you peaking again, so plan out your doses beforehand. \n\nAnd yes, you can definitely reduce the comedown with supplements and proper hydration, I would always advise to do so. \nAnd one more thing: you say you're not a stim guy, but have you actually tried more stims?

Obviously, I just did molly past night and also did that meth on New Year\u2019s only because I was scammed into thinking it was molly in the first place so you already know about that experience, and I think I mentioned taking like 70 mg. or so of my Vyvanse a couple times before as opposed to my regular dose too so there\u2019s that one as well.\n\nIn terms of other stims I\u2019ve done, alcohol is technically a stimulant/depressant but I almost never drink alone anymore because it\u2019s much more fun socially and even when I drink around friends, I never do it enough to black out or even throw up anymore like I did once or twice by accident when I was younger. I did do a small bump of coke at a Halloween party last year because it was offered to me and I\u2019d never done it before but while I loved it for the 15-minute long peak, I did NOT like how paranoid I was for the next couple hours, how fast my heart was beating for so long and especially how irritated and even angry I felt the next day so it\u2019s the kind of thing that I\u2019d be completely ok with either never doing ever again or only if a line or two is offered to me for free in a social setting like it was for my first and so far only time.\n\nOther than that though, I honestly can\u2019t think of any other stims I\u2019ve ever done so I\u2019m pretty sure that that\u2019s it.", "replies": {"g7owhdo": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/j4uxh6/is_there_any_way_to_safely_get_another_very/g7owhdo/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1601856521.0, "body": "Well, I hope you find something you like!", "replies": {"g7p3wsl": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/j4uxh6/is_there_any_way_to_safely_get_another_very/g7p3wsl/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1601860292.0, "body": "Thanks, I\u2019m sure I will :)", "replies": {}}}}}}}}}}}}, "g7o0agd": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/j4uxh6/is_there_any_way_to_safely_get_another_very/g7o0agd/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1601840525.0, "body": "Kind of seem like you are looking for meth, but wouldn't recommend it.", "replies": {"g7ojf27": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/j4uxh6/is_there_any_way_to_safely_get_another_very/g7ojf27/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1601849278.0, "body": "Yeah, that\u2019s what the only other commenter on this post said too so I\u2019ll just err on the side of caution by assuming you\u2019re both correct and that I DID in fact end up doing a shitload of meth possibly mixed with only a little bit of molly that night, since I\u2019ll unfortunately never know for sure because I obviously didn\u2019t test anything before doing it that night because I bought it all at the rave itself.\n\nI have little to no real desire to do meth again really at any point in the future considering how completely awful I felt for the entire next week or so after that experience, so I can\u2019t see myself ever touching it again.

I got the 4.0 + destroyed my brain, likely permanently. The day I found out that I was unintentionally abusing vyvanse happened to also be the day it stopped working, permanently. I became scared. Dosed 2-3x my prescription amount in order to feel the high again; my personal reassurance everything would be okay. The only sympathetic effects I noticed were elevated heart rate, dry mouth, and instead of the usual mental/body rush, I felt extremely fatigued. Has anyone ever heard of or witnessed this? (Please comment, I\u2019m looking for someone who I can talk to about this) One day it works. The next it doesn\u2019t.\n\nSuffered many symptoms. Constant fatigue. Inability to concentrate. Couldn\u2019t get up in the morning. Caffeine literally gave me the worst fucking migraines in my life, for the first time ever. I was late to class. I couldn\u2019t prioritize. I could not multi-task for the life of me. My memory was impaired. I couldn\u2019t carry a conversation without stuttering. The list goes on. Life was terrible. \n\nEdit: At this point, I tried Caffeine-NALT mixture &amp; also dexedrine, both caused severe severe headaches. Extremely irritable.\n\nFast forward a few months, I take a genetic test from a psychiatrist. Sampled by saliva. Turns out I somehow became a poor metabolizer due to lack of CYP2D6 (and a few others) (this specific enzyme happens to be concentrated in the substantial nigra which is where stimulants primarily do their job, so it makes sense), which is responsible for metabolizing most drugs, including stimulants. I was started on bupropion (an atypical anti-depressant) and it worked. It gave me energy (at least at first) and concentration, but very mildly impaired my working memory.\n\nFast forward a year, I attempt to try vyvanse again, after so long, because maybe my brain magically healed. It had a delayed-onset with half the rush it used to provide for me. After 2 days (once / day), I was in the same exact position I was in before. Literally zero.\n\nFast forward a few months, I learn I\u2019m severely Vitamin D deficient (&amp;lt;12ng/ug) and have anemia. I get a prescription for 50K D3 IU per week, and my god. The burst of ENERGY I received on my first dose did everything for me. Extreme levels of ENERGY, cognition, verbal fluidity. I no longer had trouble waking up in the morning the next day. My acne cleared. It seemed like a cure to all my ailments. Tolerance developed after 3 weeks. And by the 4th week, it did exactly zero for me. Baseline again, all my symptoms returned. I stopped taking it for a few weeks, then tried again, it worked but it wasn\u2019t the same as the first time. Tolerance had reset and i understood that I had to maintain a level of tolerance to the D3 in order for it to work (including sunlight, i can\u2019t receive sunlight everyday, otherwise I\u2019ll grow tolerant; after a few days of constant sunlight, I could sit for hours and I\u2019ll still feel fatigued). Note: based on reading/studying everywhere, I am confident this is an atypical reaction from D3, even for someone who is deficient)\n\nFast forward a year, I get an infection &amp;amp; was temporarily prescribed glucocorticoids, specifically prednisone. Guess what? ENERGY. Explosive energy. At HALF THE DOSE. Verbal fluidity. Cognition. Working memory. My mouth became dry, and my \u201crestless leg syndrome\u201d returned from out of the blue. I was firing on all cylinders. It felt like vyvanse, I swear to God. It was more powerful than the first dose of Vitamin D3. Again, atypical response to prednisone.\n\nCan you guess what\u2019s in common between Vitamin D & Prednisone?\n\nFast forward one more year, 2 days ago. I tried armodafinil 30mg (split a 250mg tab into 8 pieces), and it worked like a charm. The energy came back. The focus. The concentration. A feeling which I hadn\u2019t felt in a long time, &amp;amp; I missed it so much. I took it again today, and the effect seemed significantly less. It\u2019s very likely that if I take it again tomorrow, the effect will be even more diminished.\n\nI\u2019m actually sad. On the verge of crying. I want this to work. My potential is hindered by not using these substances. (Sorry, venting)\n\nAfter some surface level research, it seems as though the CYP450 enzyme system is partially responsible for modulating Vitamin D levels. Also, this enzymatic system (specifically CYP3A4, others as well) is induced by glucocorticoids. In addition, Vitamin D and prednisone both act as hormones, influencing gene transcription inside the nuclei of our cells. (Bupropion also does this, maybe that\u2019s why it worked for me?)\n\nI want to fix my chronic fatigue/lack of concentration. I want to be able to live with stable energy levels, and be able to get up out of my bed every morning, and be a productive member of society.\n\nI\u2019m trying to piece together this puzzle but I don\u2019t know where to go beyond this. All I fundamentally know right now is I likely over exhausted my substantia nigra. I\u2019m considering seeing a neuropsychiatrist.

I've had a few weeks clean here and there, and then a notable 3 months... But as soon as life got tough, the cravings hit hard. (Around day 90 clean) I was consumed. I was haunted with manifestations od vivid imagery of a crack pipe. The taste. The smell. The excitement, the rush, there's fucking nothing like it! There is NOTHING LIKE SUFFOCATING IN fucking  CRACK SMOKE.\n\nWent 100 days clean. Binged over the weekend and spent$2,000. $1,000 of which I stole fromcmy own father. Fortunately he forgave me and still has faith in me! Flash forward to today, I just got out of rehab about 2 weeks ago and have been smoking crack ever since. I've spent another couple thousand. Lost interest in getting clean. Recently mustered up some motivation, so here comes another 180 days!\n\nDon't get me wrong, I would be elated to say \"I know for a fact I'll never smoke crack again. Nope, I'm done getting high forever.\"\n\nBut it wouldn't be very realistic. I have said this time and time again. I accept that I will struggle with this for the rest of my life. I've got a few more relapses coming per my current mentality. I am in the extreme high risk category of recovering-addict cases, but I know many, many people who were much worse & now have years of clean time under their belt. The best thing I can do is implement and hammer in the concept of balance, and put as many things in between me and drugs as possible.\n\nSo yes, I understand that I have reservations and I am setting myself up to use in the future- but at least I'm being honest about it. Before, I tried to convince everyone else I was really about living the rest of my life clean and sober in hopes that I could convince myself. I've tried to commit to getting clean and quitting 5 or 6 times now. I am able to succeed for some amount of time, but then I get bored and drop the ball.\n\nAnyhow, well I'm taking a rather unconventional stance. I am not concerned with sobriety. Living sober is not really a goal of mine. Living a successful life is my goal.   One takes precedent. I will do what it takes to be successful as long as I have that knowledge, but swearing off drugs for good hasn't helped me thus far. \n\nAnyhow thanks for the motivartion, HERE COMES 120 DAYS CLEAN BABY.\n\nInvoles:\n\nWeight-training: 6 days per week\nCardio: 3-5 days per week\nReading: 30 minutes per day\nMeditation: 20 minutes (AM), 20 minutes (PM)", "replies": {"flq4ndw": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/fpsui4/this_is_the_truth_doing_drugs_and_not_getting/flq4ndw/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1585407757.0, "body": "Hell ya bro congrats.

Maybe someone will think more than I did before taking drugs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I was a drug abuser, mostly MDMA, I abused it for like 1 year or maybe 1.5 years. Taking ridiciulous amounts, not sticking to 3 months rule, classical shit. I stopped 5 months ago, there were no problems, well, maybe except a few HPPD like vision symptoms, but overall feeling in my head was 100% good, no depression, no brain fog, nothing wrong. I was really clean, only weed and alcohol, and during COVID-19 basically only some alcohol, not in big amounts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd on 24.05 I stupidly decided to do a nexus flip (MDMA + 2CB). First of all I just wanted to make a small celebration of my birthday with one quarter of 160mg pill, but in my dumbness I finished at taking about 200mg MDMA (I weight 56kg so it's one of the bigger doses) and 10mg 2CB. I puked once on redosing but it was not a big deal at it has happened to my on my previous binges so it didn't worry me. Effects were as they were supossed to be, nothing different than before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I started at 00:00 and finished on 9.00 am on Monday. Took 0.5mg of alprazolam and went to sleep, everything was fine TBH, maybe slight problems with moving around, but hey, it is possible as I was on drugs. I woke up at 14.00, went to the shop, still a bit trippy but not so much, pupils were normal. Took another 0.5mg of alprazolam and went to sleep again, I woke up at 17.00 and maaaaan, everything was spinning, I guess it's called vertigo in english. Loss of balance, the world is spinning, it's the first time in my life I have something like this, never had such thing on a comedown. Even when sitting on a chair the world was spinning and making me sick, so I vomited twice (I ate a yoghurt and a sandwich after waking up). I went to sleep at like 00:00 and woke up at 5:00 AM (Tuesday), everything was still spining so I figured out it would be best to take another 0.5mg of alprazolam and just sleep it out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up on 11-12:00 AM, ate some yoghurt and vomited once more, then I drank some water and guess what, vomited again. \"That's not normal\" I thought, especially if I had nothing to vomit with anymore. As it was even hard for me to move around and I was vomiting more and more I called my friend, went to ER. I was really honest to the doctor and he was a real professional, treated me like a human beeing, not a drug addicted idiot. At 8.00 PM he gave me a shot of something and told me if it helps for the night but in the morning I will feel worse than in the night then I need to see my GP because it's something with my labirynth maze (that thing in ear). It helped and on the next day (Wednesday) I was pretty much back to normal, well, almost, I still had some troubles walking but it was much better, so I thought \"it's just a really rough comedown, everything will be fine\". I started taking 5-htp along with vitamin C and magnesium.\n\nAh, and in the ER I was told that they don't have techniques to diagnose me properly in the hospital, that's why I have to visit my GP. GG polish health service.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo that's what the past week looked like:\n\n25.05 (Monday) - world started spinning, definitely not a good day\n\n26.05 - worst day ever, believe me, but I acutally started to feel better when I was in the ER\n\n27.05 - actually a best day in last week, not so much spinning, just some troubles walking, pretty optimistic\n\n28.05 - pretty much like a day before, with a little brain fog \n\n29.05 - started to get worse \n\n30.05 - it started spinning again like 30mins after taking 5-htp in the evening, I felt like the MDMA is kicking once more, big troubles with walking but no vomiting, I decided to lay off 5-htp\n\n31.05 - same as a previous day, just without eating 5-htp\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now we have first of June and it's not better. I'm seeing my GP tommorow, sadly it's just a videocall, because hey, it's covid time, but I think he'll sent me to psychiatrist or laryngologist and they'll have to meet me in person to properly diagnose me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I'm holding my head still it's not that bad, I can focus on browsing the web on the computer, play some games normally but when I move my head world spins like crazy. I have problems with walking straight, not mentioning turning around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou know what's the worst? It was not a big amount for me, I had worse benders where I took 500mg of MDMA or even sometimes more in one night. And these didn't destroy me as much as this one did. After these binges I was even able to go out with my friends on a next day and be pretty much normal, just a little tired, now I can't even go to the shop or pickup a parcel that's waiting for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore abusing so badly I once had a stress induced brain fog and derealization but it went away after a few months. I would gladly exchange that vertigo I have for these few months of derealization. At least I was able to move and go out with my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo watch out kids, drugs are bad, okayyyyy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut maybe it's not the drugs, who knows, maybe it's just an inner ear infection? I just realized I have more problems when turning head to the right than to the left, my right ear is feeling a bit weird, and I sometimes lose a hearing on that ear for a short while (happened maybe twice). It would just be a really big coincidence that this infection happened in this time period.\n\nJust hope it's not a permanent damage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTime will tell. And I will update, because maybe someone will find my case useful and similar to his one.  \nHave a nice day guys. Hope your is better than mine.\n\nEdit: So as I said here\u2019s update:\n\nOn monday (01.06) I tried Epley maneuver, it helped me a lot! I was like 95% recovered on 02.06, just with some minor loss of balance while looking down or turning my head to the right while walking.\n\nOn 03.06 I saw a laryngologist who ordered me to do some diagnostic test for my labirynth and to see a neurologist. She also prescribed me betahistini dihydrochloridum twice a day, but in the evening of that day I was like 98% normal. I believe I\u2019ll be back to my normal state in several days.\n\nSo yeah, I can walk, do what I want in my house and outside, yesterday I\u2019ve seen my friends and I had no problems with anything.\n\nIt\u2019s good to be back.\n\nEdit2:\nSo, a lot happened since last week.\n\nOn 5.06 I felt some pain on the right side of my head, and I got a little bit stressed\n\nOn 6.06 I had some troubles walking, sitting on chair was okay. I believe it was connected to stress from previous day but I'm not sure\n\nOn 8.06 I was in a restaurant and I got a little bit stressed and well, I had some troubles with turning my head and walking straight but nothing big.\n\nOn 9.06 I drunk like one 0.5l beer and when walking to home at 10.30 PM I had like a panic attack, my heart was beating very fast, over 100 BPM I believe. I had trobule with walking straight and I thought I would pass out in public. Then I got a bit of vertigo and I couldn't sleep well in the night, but I was better in the morning, went to shop and now at 10 PM I'm much better. I'm worried that this is Meniere's diesease attack, and as there is no cure for this illness I'm a bit fucked.\n\nEdit3: It's 16.06 today, last week was okay, I'm still having problems with balance and slight spinning of objects but that's all. I saw a neurologist and she said my brain is 100% okay.\n\nI'm still very stressed and I think this is contributing to the spinning.\n\nOn 13.06 I attended a bbq party with my friends, no alcohol for me, and I was feeling normal, with one weird derealization/brain fog period which lasted for like 4 hours, but then it went away. 100% normal me, just with slight balance problems.\n\nAnd I have some tinnitus but I also had it before...\n\nMaybe it's just vestibular toxicity exaggerated by me freaking out? I don't know.\n\nOne thing is sure, no more drugs. Stay safe guys.\n\nEdit4: Doing normal things, walking, driving car, only with minor balance issues and I have to turn around a bit slower. Ah, and while I'm lying on my back the world is a bit spinning but when I close my eyes it's okay and unnoticable.\n\nI also spotted that my vision in right eye was blurry, and I don't think it was that big before I used drugs last time. So I went to an oculist, had my eyes checked and I'll have to wear glasses. I was worried that I damaged my eye nerve but thank God I guess it's not that case.\n\nShit happens but I think I'll walk out from this with relative low price to pay.\n\nEdit5:\nI had a videonystagmography (VNG) done, and some audio tests, my hearing is fine, a bit worse in right ear but that's in the norm, max -15dB, except for -35 dB on 6000 Hz frequency (in both ears, and that's weird). I had a nystagmus on right sight during dix-hallpike maneuver and I was diagnosed with BPPV.\n\nThe only thing that worries me and I don't know why is happening is that I sometimes suddenly go deaf in one ear for like 5-10s and I start to hear ringing in that ear. It happened twice just after first attack of vertigo in the beginning, and after that on 17th, 21st and 25th of June. In both ears but one at a time, last three times were in left ear, previous two in right ear. Hope it's not meniere's related.\n\nEdit6: So it went off, on 15th of July I was fully recovered. And on ~15th of September it came back without taking any drugs. At first it was just sensation of losing balance for a half of second while sitting or walking, now it's 23rd of September and it's getting worse, without vertigo thankfully, 'just' troubles with focusing eyes, troubles with balance while walking and sitting (but I'm able to walk on my own), brain fog and derealization. It was very mild, just some troubles with balance up to 18th but that day I drunk like three beers and one energy drink with my friends and on 19th shit hit the fan.\n\nGoing to visit laryngologist and neurologist, let's see what they will say.\n\nThe worst thing is that I was 100% normal and it went down without any reasonable cause, I was drinking alcohol since I recovered and also drinking energy drinks so it wasn't anything new.

Then I get rescued by my legendary, god-sent friends.**\n\nI've been meaning to write a report of an 8 gram experience I had years ago. This peculiar trip could have ended badly and I think about how lucky I was very often. During this experience some pretty weird stuff went down. I'm talking about an encounter with the police that left me very confused. I want to make it clear from the beginning that I didn't hallucinate this encounter, experienced shroomers know that one doesn't hallucinate or see ordinary objects that aren't really there, unless the dose is stupid brutal and you're just seeing the inside of your head at that point.\n\nI'm 24, male. This trip happened when I was 19 years old. Before that day I had had just a handful of low dose trips and considered myself well prepared. I was very wrong. I acquired the shrooms, and went to ask my best friend to look after me while I tripped. We'll call her \"R\". R at the time was also 19 and I was very infatuated with her, which I didn't know was going to affect my trip.\n\nSo I eat the shrooms and we put on a movie. I smoke a bowl while I'm coming up. About 30 minutes in I start to notice a little drifting/whirlpool effect and I am content. I wasn't thinking about R and I didn't want to. I just wanted to enjoy the movie. But just another half hour in, my head makes this sudden connection and I realize I have no future with this girl, who I'm pretty much in love with. It was one of those epiphany type moments or at least felt like it. It wasn't a big deal just shit that happens to people but the situation got completely overblown by my high ass brain at the time. I ended up having a panic attack and storming out of my own apartment at like 3 am without saying a word. It wasn't anything she said, it was my own head.\n\nSo I leave the apartment building and start sprinting hard. Heartbroken and in pure panic, I run some 4 miles north through suburbs and main roads, without catching a break, totally freaked out and amped up. During this time I also had the feeling that I was being chased by someone or something.\n\nIn the middle of my running I realize I have my phone on me and I don't know how, I could barely make sense of the screen, but I manage to call my very friend \"T\". T also has some experience with shrooms and knew I was taking 8 grams that night. I explain to him I've ran away, I don't know where I am, and it would mean the world to me if he could come get me. I tell him I think I'm near a walmart, the only one in our area. He says \"I'm on my way\". What a fuckin' legend. I keep running and lose my phone somewhere.\n\nI didn't know how long it had been since speaking with T but I was still on the move. I had taken my shirt off while I ran and was in my shorts and sneakers. I remember trying to run in a straight line and when I encountered a fence I just jumped over it it. I ran through people's backyards. At the time I felt that my life was in danger. People definitely heard the racket and called the cops, just what any normal person would do.\n\nSo the mushroom is running its course, and I start to shift to a different state of mind. While I ran I didn't really have any major hallucinations, just your usual drifting and shifting. However, I was starting to feel more and more powerful. I felt very powerful, glorious, invincible and perfect. I no longer felt in one place, I felt  impossibly tied, knotted through to everything inside my perception. \n\nI started having the cognitive hallucination that I was God himself, or itself, or whatever it is. At this point I'm yelling shit like \"death is nothing to me\", \"I am god\", \"I am invincible\", \"I love R\", embarrasing bs like that.\n\nThis is when the police encounter happens. My running has slowed down to jogging, though I'm still yelling incoherencies real loud. I find myself at a 4 way intersection of lonely, secondary roads. It is at this time that I see the SUV cop cars moving in my direction. In total I encounter three clearly marked police SUV's. The first one comes at me from the road on my right and as it approaches my location the cop turns on the siren and lights. I see it and feel no fear, I start screaming very aggressively at the approaching car, things like \"I'm not afraid to die\", and \"come at me motherfucker\", etc. The lit up SUV comes closer and closer, but suddently it accelerates and drives straight past me, past the red stop light, and away. Then I spot two other marked SUV's coming from the road on my left (opposite direction) with their sirens already on, they're coming at me paired up and I'm doing the same, screaming in anger at them. I am literally shirtless on the darn road making a racket. As they reach my location, they accelerate and drive away. I'm not making this up. They were definitely aware of my presence.\n\nSo basically three cop cars rode past a shirtless, yelling, crazed freak, running about at 3 am, and they didn't do a damn thing about it.\n\nDisappointed I didn't get to fight any cops, I  left the scene. It was only after the trip that I realized how impossibly lucky I was. It was a miracle I wasn't in jail, or even shot dead. But the story doesn't end there. I keep moving until I see this random one story building and decide to climb up on its roof. This building was some sort of private storage and its perimeter was protected by a high metal fence and spikes. I climb the fence and the spikes scratch me up but I can't even feel it. I proceed to climb up on the roof. There were some piled up tires that I use to get up there. Now on the roof I start to scream and bang on my chest like a freakin' animal. I do this for I don't know how long, and at some point, to my surprise, both my friends T and R pull up in the car. They said they found me because of all the screaming.  I'm not coming down so they get up there with me and force me down. Then, we go home.\n\nThank you T and R. I don't know how the police let me go the first time but I'm sure a second encounter would have been catastrophic.", "author": "InfoCrave999", "score": 67, "flair": "Long Post", "created": 1577577508.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/egsblc/8_gram_trip_report_heroic_dose_divine_intervention/", "num_comments": 7, "title": "8 gram trip report - heroic dose - divine intervention", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fc9aiz2": {"score": 19, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/egsblc/8_gram_trip_report_heroic_dose_divine_intervention/fc9aiz2/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1577578473.0, "body": "> Welcome to lesson one: Set and Setting.\n\nI once heared a ted talk about a recovering alcoholic just sticking to three rules.

I haven't done every drug in the world, but I *have* done every *type* of drug there is. Psychedelics, MDMA, stimulants, benzos, opioids, cannabis, alcohol, you name it. I just wanted to shed some light on amphetamines (as well as compare them to psychedelics) for a second\u2014I know that amphetamine kind of has a lowkey bad reputation as far as addiction, dependence, tolerance and withdrawals go, but despite all of the negative aspects and risks that may come with taking them, I just want to share how I believe that they literally, mentally, take you to another world.\n\nMost people would probably argue that psychedelics or LSD are the drugs responsible for doing this and that when compared to amphetamine, amp doesn't even come close, but I beg to differ. I believe psychedelics don't take you to another world, they just **enhance** the world you are already in, changing your perception of it to view it from a bird's eye view if not just an entirely different angle.\n\nAmphetamine, however, takes you out of this reality entirely and brings you to a completely different one, full of love, bliss, confidence, happiness and more. You *could* say it's just changing your perception of *this* reality as well, just like psychs (though of course to a lesser extent and simply to a more positive one), and while I that may be true, to **me, personally,** I just feel like it takes you to a different reality man.\n\nA reality where everyhthing is just \"right\".

Made this account specifically to ask for some knowledgeable opinions about what I've personally been struggling with. i had been doing cocaine for about 4 months pretty much everyday maybe taking a 1 day break here and there. Was never doing a ridiculous amount maybe 1-1.5 G max in a day and that was a lot in a day for me. ( Would like to say that before I started doing coke I was doing MDMA on and off all summer pretty frequently but not nearly to the extent I did coke ) I was having a great time but then I started noticing I would get really anxious and start focusing on my heart rate and would think I'm about to pass out. I would stop doing cocaine for the day but the feeling would always stay until I was finally able to sleep. Would wake up with brutal morning anxiety and seem to always need someone with me to keep me calm \n\n\n\n( haven't done cocaine for about a month and I still get anxiety here and there and can feel my heart rate but it fades away eventually ) did MDMA for 3 days at the end of all this and the day after i started getting this electric kind of pulse feeling through my whole body and whenever I would smoke weed it would amp right up. That was at the point when I had stopped everything coke, mdma and weed.\n\n\n\n The weird electric type pulse feeling I would get In my whole body finally went away slowly over the course of a week. But now I can't smoke weed without feeling my heart beat and getting bad anxiety don't have that electric pulse feeling anymore tho. ( take into account i was a HARDCORE pothead for years before could smoke insane amounts and not be insanely high ) however last time I smoked I thought my appendix was rupturing cause I was getting a very odd uncomfortable feeling in my side. Dr says it's just inflamation which I have no idea if that's truely what it is. and I nearly fainted at work from it started sweating profusely and got dizzy as all hell i literally thought I was about to die.\n\n\n\n So here I am wondering if I will ever be able to smoke weed again and also wondering what I could do to fix the situation with any supplements or therapy or anything really I'm open to ideas that's why I'm here. I'm really trying to get on the right path I don't want to do Coke/MDMA ever again and I know that I screwed up big time but i do want to be able to enjoy weed eventually because that was always a thing that would calm me down.\n\n\n\n Only thing I seem to be able to do is drink here and there but the next day I have brutal anxiety and NEED someone with me to reassure me that Im fine and to pretty much make sure I don't die cause I just Get really worried about my heart cause I can really feel it and my odd side pain that's about 3/10 on scale of pain it's mostly just very uncomfortable and it just seems to stick around when I'm fucked up and then is there all day on/off.\n\n\n\n Have had my friends smart watch check my heartbeat in the middle of one of these episodes and they were all saying how my heart beat is just a little bit high nothing crazy I believe it was in the 100-110 BPM range. But  regardless of what i was told I would still really feel this  uncomfortable feeling in my right shoulder / chest area wasn't painful  just very uncomfortable pretty much the same way I'd feel of coke without the coke high it would get me really worked up and scared which never happened to me with anything prior to all this.\n\n\n\n sorry for such a long dragged out post but I could really use some advice or answers. Please ask any questions you have if you want more info I will answer everyone.

When they arrived, we confirmed the patient was slumped over in the back seat with inadequate snoring respiration. \n\nHe was extracted from the car. Pulse was bounding, pupils were grossly dilated with minimal but equal reactivity, patient withdrew from painful stimuli but had no verbal or eye opening response. Signs of IV drug use were present and the friends stated he typically used opiates. Oxygen saturation was initially 82% on room air. \n\nChin-lift technique resolved snoring respiration but respiration was still slow in rate and air movement was inadequate. Bag-valve ventilation began and an 18g IV in the dorsum was established. 3mg naloxone was given via push over 5 minutes, which was ineffective. The patient was moved inside for further evaluation & treatment. \n\nHe was switched to 4L oxygen via non-rebreather. Another 20g IV was started in the opposite anticubidal - bloods were drawn off. Among the tests we ran were glucose and drug screen. Glucose was found to be 34mg/dl (*very* low) - drug screen was positive for amphetamines + cocaine. An odor of alcoholic beverage was also apparent from the patient, so a saliva was taken which came to 0.28BAC. We noticed he felt hot to touch - a temperature of 103.6F was present. \n\nA 4 minute seizure occured, which stopped after 1 amp of D25 was given. 1mg lorazepam was given for good measure. Another 2 minute seizure occured soon thereafter, which was stopped with 2mg lorazepam. We started ice-pack cooling. A 12 lead ECG was obtained which was sinus tachycardia at 120bpm. \n\nOver 30 minutes, he became increasingly agitated, making verbal threats towards us and other patients.  6mg Haldol was given - his nap was roughly as many hours as MGs of Haldol. \n\nAt the point he woke up he was still obviously intoxicated, though compliant. His friends picked him up, that was that.", "author": "Microfagit99", "score": 6, "flair": "Stimulants", "created": 1588153819.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ga0iv5/case_report_adverse_reaction_to_speedball_alcohol/", "num_comments": 6, "title": "Case Report = Adverse reaction to speedball + alcohol", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fox8kbx": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/ga0iv5/case_report_adverse_reaction_to_speedball_alcohol/fox8kbx/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1588165592.0, "body": "Interesting.

I have opened up businesses, spent a bunch of money on them and then closed them in a week because I got bored of it. Yeah, it's bad. I also have severe OCD and PTSD, and get horrible intrusive thoughts constantly. I also have physical tics that destroy my body because of how raw I make it from repetitive movements I can't control. These tics have almost gotten me into a car accident before. And lastly I also have extremely unstable moods, I'll go from peak ego to severely depressed within 15 minutes. These mental health issues make my life unbearable normally. I don't know the exact terms, I'm not a mental health professional obviously but I believe this personality cluster is a pretty common one hence why I wanted to make this post. See I spent 19 years of my life going unmedicated as I was stupid and thought that ***medication was for weak people.*** On a daily basis I am so neurotic, uncontrolled and frankly psychotic that I just want to die. However, this all changed a few days ago.\n\n2 weeks ago I went to a doctor for the first time in my life to describe my mental health issues. I was first prescribed Adderall XR and it was fucking awful. I was even more neurotic and crazy however this time I was 10 times more amped up and couldn't sleep. So, after weaning off of it my doctor then convinced me to try 50 Mg of Zoloft. And oh my god I couldn't be happier with it. No anxiety, literally none. Normally there's a million thoughts flowing through my head every second however with this medication, I focus on one singular thing at a time. No more random spells of aggression and mood swings that make me go from on top of the world to wanting to die every 15 minutes. It's incredible. Even when faced with daunting/unfun tasks I still get them out of the way without feeling bad about it.\n\nThis medication is INCREDIBLE. And while I know everybody reacts differently to it, I know my mental health conditions are so common that if you haven't tried this I can't help but recommend it. It's also very cheap, for 40 bucks a month I get to feel relief from mental hell. Oh yeah and I should also mention that weed isn't a good way to cope with these disorders if you relate to me and happen to self medicate that way. It only makes you feel good for a few hours and then it's straight back to hell. I should also mention that normally I am ADDICTED to weed and smoke it all day and night and eat a lot of edibles. Though on this medication? I haven't even had the urge to smoke once.\n\nI WILL SAY THERE are some cons with this medication:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. The first 2 days you take it you'll be met with adjustment symptoms, like diarrhea, motion sickness, drowsiness. But I heavily recommend sticking it out because if you do there's a massive light at the end of the tunnel.\n2. I wouldn't recommend smoking weed or drinking alcohol on it. You can do whatever you want obviously but I tried smoking one day and drinking the next and I was really sick feeling and had to lay down.\n3. It can limit your creativity because it seemingly blocks the train of thought required to be creatively ambitious in my experience.\n\nYou are ***NOT*** weak for needing medication, and there is ***ZERO*** reason to feel embarrassed about it. Most people in my experience suffer from stuff like this and they go unmedicated because there's a (RIDICULOUS) stigma surrounding medication.

I used to snort and switched to smoking a year ago. My question is if anyone has ever slept for about 17 hours, woke up feeling \u201coff\u201d and disconnected from themselves? I have been using so long that I can smoke bubble after bubble and still somehow pass out and sleep forever even if I still have the pipe in my hand. Sometimes I don\u2019t remember exactly how I got to my bed or stuff from the night before. I\u2019ve always felt a lack of care for myself but this feels like flat out disassociation or depersonalization? And it\u2019s never been this severe until I woke up earlier today. Even my vision feels different/slightly off. I have never been a paranoid or tweak the fuck out kind of user, and even now am still sitting and chilling, smoking a bub to see if that kinda snaps everything back to normal.

Most of my life I've been escaping into drugs and the internet, when I decided to get my shit together I knew I had to cut many of these drugs out of my life if I wanted to live past my 20s. I was taking drugs from nearly every class on a daily basis, alcohol being my ultimate vice. I decided to quit in order of how likely each drug would be to kill me if I kept going (maximizing chance of survival?) I'll make a list of each.\n\nQUITTING:\n\nI Started by getting rid of my oxys, after an injury I had healed up I was out of percs. Then my boi ODd (rip Eric) cutting off my only source for opiates. I've been off them for 12 weeks now with very slight cravings\n\nThen I started tapering alcohol, this is ongoing as I was consuming a retarded amount of alcohol. I'm down to occasional drinks at my moms house. Stopped blacking out but I have cravings every second of every day.\n\nOnce I was off the painkillers I stopped abusing amps (although I have taken a few Dexedrine since then but that's nothing compared to what I was doing). Quit doing coke at the same time. I've been off them for 8 weeks with the literal opposite of cravings\n\nNext on the list is quitting benzos. My taper was over a few weeks ago, unfortunately I don't know how long it's been since I took them but the withdrawals are over and my cravings are surprisingly minimal.  I will miss these the most\n\nLSD, I think I may be one of the only people who have ever had an addiction to acid but I was taking over 1000ug a month I literally HAD to drop acid if I was to spend anytime outside. Otherwise I wasn't going. mild dependence is how I'd classify it I guess\n\nCigarettes, well I'm on the patch hoping to get off these bad boys soon, had half a cig today and that's my best so far. Literally the hardest drug to quit so far. \n\n\nKEEPING:\n\nDissos such as nitrous and ketamine. I never had a problem with these drugs and ketamine actually saved me and my brother from ourselves more than once, also I use like once a year so its not damaging me much\n\nPsychedelics other than LSD. I have exploration to finish in the realms of Dimitri and the mushroom, mescaline too :)\n\nCannabis is my problem child.

Plus I use a game pad with auto aim much better. We are doing missions with my friends and voice chat.\n\nI played many games : witcher 3(3 times maybe), far cry 5(twice), new dawn, TR 2013, csgo, spiderman marvel ps4, Wolfstein 2, rdr2, age of empires, hitman etc.\n\n\nI always avoided LOL, wow etc. Especially games like wow where people buy items and level up.

It's so amazing blowing choppers with rockets like movies omg....\n\nThanks god I avoided all those wow like games. I understand why people get hooked. Those games must have anti addiction prevention systems\n\nWhat is the difference between gta 5 and cocaine?
