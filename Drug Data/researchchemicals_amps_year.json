{"espqa3": {"text": "* **Disclaimer:** *I was quite high when I wrote this. I do not recommend IVing this chemical as I believe it could do some devastating damage in a very short period of time compared to something like meth. The first shot I injected into my hand, I felt a burn go all the way up left arm. I have had multiple people DM me asking this same question that were using different sources for their 3-MMC; along with a comment on this post from a Redditor that had collapsed veins just from sporadic use.*\n\n*I just have not seen any posts documenting high dose usage. Do not ever IV anything like Meth or 3-MMC unless you want a crippling addiction (meth is the one that got me). I don\u2019t promote the use of this intravenously as I could see prolong usage exponentially causing much more damage than meth to your veins and your heart as well.*\n\n# Report: High Dosage use of IV 3-MMC\n\n* First IV\u2019d 200mg, felt a taste at the back of my throat. 15 minutes later I did a 300mg shot. Blew my fucking mind. A 15 minute INTENSE  Meth/MDMA/Coke rush followed by an intense euphoria MDMA-esque body high that peaks around an hour in or so, and then slowly tapers down for a total duration of 4 to 6 hours.\n\n1. Every re-dose would get me as high as the last. you aren\u2019t chasing that first shot, you are experiencing it at the same dosages. Fucking unbelievable compound. **(EDIT:** *I wrote this in the context that consecutive re-dosing in a day with IV Meth does not feel as good as first shot IN MY EXPERIENCE. Using this compound on a daily basis will surely result in bath-salt esque hallucinations/psychoses and will definitely lead to chasing the dragon. But a 3 gram binge in under 48 hours seemed to produce the exact same rush at the same dosages FOR ME personally*.)\n2. 300mg IV is what I recommend if you want that extreme guaranteed 15min+ intense rush; much more intense than meth in my opinion. I most likely prefer it because l like SRAs more in general; whereas as meth releases little serotonin in my experience compared to 3-MMC (*I DO NOT promote or CONDONE this; only recommend this if you are already doing it or are going to anyways)*\n3. It just leaves you so relaxed too. Like cocaine and MDMA combined without the negatives and a much milder comedown. I binged about \\~2grams in the past 34 hours; did my last shot about 2 hours ago. Was surprised I got the same rush every time from the same dosages, no diminishing returns (in terms of the rush).\n\n\n\n# Highest Dose: 360mg+ IV 3-MMC\n\n* Highest dose took at once was 360mg+; fucking intense. Crazy nystagmus and sweating like crazy with incredible euphoria.\n\n1. My doses were on average between 200mg to 300mg with no  dopaminergic stimulant or MDMA tolerance.\n2. Currently going to go to sleep; this stuff is quite fiendish ESPECIALLY IV\u2019D. But it\u2019s the best rush I ever experienced that\u2019s followed up by an MDMA-like body high and a positive empathetic headspace.\n\n* I\u2019ll definitely follow up on how I feel tomorrow after I get some sleep. 2 grams IV\u2019d is a fucking lot with no tolerance. I\u2019ll be sure to post the negative side effects and any depressive or anxiety related symptoms.\n* Will update how I\u2019m doing tomorrow considering I slammed \\~2 grams of 3-MMC in less than 36 hours.\n\n\n\n# UPDATE:\n\n* IV\u2019d between 300 and 500mg. Still rushing hard to type crazy  nystagmus . Heart rate at 120. Still less than my usual 130 from meth insufflated (less than .2 total spread out).\n\n# UPDATE 2:\n\n* Intense rush lasted 20 minutes. don\u2019t feel too hot and not sweaty like crazy. gnarly nystagmus; jaw clenching was alleviated by some Magnesium Glycinate, hands just as shaky as if so drank a cup of coffee.\n* *Note: Missed shots seem to still absorb, unlike meth. Takes a little but it definitely works. Had 3 missed shots (one big, rest very small since I pulled the syringe out), Rubbing the missed shots seem to make me a start to roll.*\n\n# UPDATE 3:\n\n* Rush is ending and I\u2019m able to see typos due to the nystagmus dissipating.\n* Would also like to add, the first time I shot up I felt it burn up my arm. Do not regularly IV this. Oral dosing is amazing too but if you were addicted to IVing 3-MMC your veins will be FUCKED.\n* *I do not recommend IVing personally for safety reasons; only do so if you have extensive experience with intravenous use and an extreme amount of self control. Order only 1 gram.*\n\n# UPDATE 4:\n\n* 2 hours since I IV\u2019d, pupils are no longer dilated but feel a mild nice uplifted mood still. I am experiencing noticeable vasoconstriction which isn\u2019t too uncomfortable (just some tense muscles), but I did IV 3 grams of 3-MMC in 3 days...\n* I slept last night so I am not experiencing \u201cbath salt\u201d esque hallucinations. I noticed when you initially take your first dose your vision becomes crystal clear.\n\n# Update 5:\n\n* Been 5 hours and 30 minutes since my last injection. Still feel a great mood lift even though I have not eaten lunch yet. Find it strange that I have no more 3-MMC but not craving it at all like I would meth. *(Probably because this is just recreational and after a meth rush I\u2019m productive and feel very motivated, which is something I struggle with.)*\n\n\n\n# TL;DR:\n\n* 3-MMC produces an incredible intense Meth/MDMA/Cocaine rush (you can taste it in the back of your throat) when dosed at 300mg+ intravenously that lasts between 10 to 20 minutes.\n* I do not promote the use of injecting Chinese research chemicals into your body.\n* I decided to document this because I have not seen reports of high dosage use of this chemical intravenously and thought it would be of interest to know that I do not feel like shit and injected three grams of 3-MMC into my body in under 48 hours. (Edit: More-so 40-42 hours; yikes)\n* I did sleep the previous night though to avoid bath-salt esque psychosis symptoms, but for only 5 hours max.\n* Any questions or constructive criticism is welcome in the comments section.\n\n[Comedown Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/etkwnk/3_grams_of_3mmc_ivd_in_under_48hrs_comedown_update/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n[Do not IV this shit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/espqa3/iv_3mmc_is_amazing_iv_meth/ffdivyd/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)", "author": "JustOnDrugs", "score": 109, "flair": null, "created": 1579792977.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/espqa3/iv_3mmc_is_amazing_iv_meth/", "num_comments": 189, "title": "IV 3-MMC is AMAZING > IV Meth", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"ffbikxx": {"score": 150, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/espqa3/iv_3mmc_is_amazing_iv_meth/ffbikxx/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1579795770.0, "body": "Slow the eff down", "replies": {"ffbsqj3": {"score": 51, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/espqa3/iv_3mmc_is_amazing_iv_meth/ffbsqj3/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1579810145.0, "body": "His life expectancy is counting down as well otherwise", "replies": {"ffc07yo": {"score": 16, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/espqa3/iv_3mmc_is_amazing_iv_meth/ffc07yo/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1579816976.0, "body": "Yeah I know this quite is unhealthy and will mostly likely make an update to post how bad this stuff can be for your veins.

Certainly you will have to give up doing dangerous experiments like IVing Chems not approved for human consumption. I hope you will feel better.\n\nEdit: thanks a lot for the platinum!

Very impressed with your progress and I\u2019m wishing you a complete return to non addiction. \n\nI would recommend incorporate another tool into your arsenal. When you trip see if you can find acceptance for craving. Realize what these mere sensations and thoughts really are. Just passing appearances in consciousness. Explore how they work. There usually triggered by a situation or location. Then there\u2019s a behavior we feel we need to do- we either cave to the drug or we find another relief- we distract ourselves with food , tv, phones, maybe even a psychedelic trip- but here\u2019s the thing. These reliefs are temporary- there is only one relief that is always available- curiosity about the present experience. \n\nCuriosity is inherently pleasant. You can always engage the positive emotion curiosity- I have cravings. How do I know I have cravings? I only know because cravings feel like something. What do they really feel like in my body, in my head, how do cravings color my experience. How long do they last. What causes them to start. \n\nBy exploring these cravings you can become curious so that the negative experience is replaced with a positive, non judgmental, acceptance. This is the true relief from cravings. In fact this is what meditation is all about and if you\u2019re in the right mindset for a trip it will make the process almost effortless, as opposed to having to meditate for years. \n\nI recommend you watch a few Dr. Judson Brewer videos on YouTube, leading expert on meditation for addiction.

I sublingually dosed a total of 250mg over the course of roughly 2 1/2 hours and remained lucid enough operate a stove and make beans and rice. It sounds like, as you said, \"it's over as quickly as it began\". Meaning your initial dose seems to need to be quite high to experience it's full effect profile. What's interesting to me though is how you reached the disso-hole with a 120mg dose, while my 100mg sublingual dose didn't even get me close. What was your ROA? There may also be some personal GABA receptor differences involved in mediating its effects. I *certainly* felt dissociated though, but never in the entire experience did I feel any of the dysphoria you mentioned. Also as you said, there was a **strong** feeling of being anesthetized, similar to how you feel very shortly after coming out from the N2O hole. I am considering picking some more up and continuing trials now that you've elucidated its ability to precipitate a full dissociative state. For whatever reason, this chemical feels very friendly/benign to me, however this may change after experiencing something similar to yourself. Thank you for a very relevant and useful contribution to the RC community! AFAIK nobody else has managed to hole off this substance, so this is a major breakthrough for HA-966.

I'll probably update this every now and then when I have other thoughts or for formatting. \n\n_\n\nOne thing that gets ignored is the style, frequency, consistency, and origin of the minds eye 'generation' of closed eye visuals, they seem impenetrable to objective analysis although this really is **not** the case. \n\nMany things are replicatable and easily articulated through enough examination of the experience, of visuals in general.\n\nStop paying attention to what you're seeing and start asking **how** you're experiencing it, **how** it's displayed to you, **how** do you define closed from open eye visuals ect and how are they different. This post spans from my last [biblical length post](https://amp.reddit.com/r/replications/comments/epsfhy/logical_discussion_of_lesser_explained_visual/) on visuals. \n\n**Are you really \"seeing\" those things or do you just think you are?** All these questions have some form of answer, so far here is **my** evaluation and thoughts on closed eye visuals.\n\n_\n\n**1. Your eyes don't have to be closed to experience CEVs.**\n\n There's a very fine line between closed and open eyed visuals, you call them closed eye because they're most prominent in the dark but it's exactly that, some internal projected image onto a dark contrast plane. Enough of one chemical or another produces enough stimulation to whatever part of the brain that you can't tell the TV from the back of your eyelids. Stuff like nitrous + psychs boost this ENORMOUSLY, you could easily have a mental cartoon figure projected onto your wall as I have and do experience. \n\n**2. The frequency and intensity is enhanced by stimulation to the eyeballs**\n\nSome people like myself get intense CEVs, some not so much but one factor I can speak for myself is my eyelids seem to vibrate and jitter in a restless way when I'm tripping which adds to the intensity and the CEVs jitter at the same frequency as my eyes. Try this next time you're tripping, *tense your \"facial muscles\" particularly around your eyes and ears to get that buzzing sound + sensation and your eyes will be physically stimulated immensely, causing a flood of phosphenes (stimulation of retinal cells) to be interpreted as thick, visible constructed imagery.*\n\n**3. CEVs have structural limitations, and there are several types**\n\nI can split mine into three categories;\n\n\u2022 Intense photo realistic internal imagery\n\n\u2022 responsive, drawn over, or bleeding through visual feedback\n\n\u2022 Dreamy or complex scapes + geometry, faint or strong.\n\nIt can be any of the three in combination or solo. Type one often being very graphic, gory or realistic images that can almost be mistaken for watching a movie, seeing fine fibres and textures, sweat on skin, they seem to have a definite gravity and immersiveness. Often happens in combination with dissociatives and psychedelics.\n\nType two are unique and have a drawn over effect in your visual field, seem to have a meaningfulness and mind of their own likewise. Do not fully integrate with your open visuals however works in tamdem to disrupt what you see. These are the most likely to experience after eye stimulation and for me are very \"point to point\", like a neon dot-to-dot. They don't seem to work independently per eye, if I close one eye and open the other it's the same image so there must be some kind of mental \"field\" where they take place, they're not subject to binocular rivalry (individual eyes). *these are what make up most of your typical form constant \"veils\" such as a background hexagon or weaved triangle patten when you stand in dark room.\n\nType three are one of the more common experience that you'd think of as CEVs. They contain the mental landscapes and recursions, forever forming and deepening and usually stem from that moment you close your eyes and the afterimage of what you last looked at forms into the scape. Something you might experience in a hole or during a trip. \n\n_\n\nIt's real hard to find people to discuss this shit with who don't just tell you they *\"saw a castle once and an angel and he came over and showed me my past bro it was crazy bro\"*\n\nThis is just as much a catalog for my thoughts as for us to find out what features are **subjective** vs **objective** when it comes to CEVs, and potentially figure out how this crazy thing consciousness is projected.

It is pretty common, but many people just don't pay any attention to it and so they never really notice or remember it. Once you're aware it's happening you can basically try and observe it every single time you fall asleep. Concentrating too much on these hallucinations makes you wake up though and they might disappear ;)\n\nYou don't need to fear them, they're completely naural. They are more intense when you suffer from a lack of sleep, especially REM sleep. (Maybe stopping your medication messed with your sleep cycle and that's why these hypnagogic hallucinations became more intense and more obvious to you.) Visual hallucinations usually appear first, these can range from just blurry colors, ormabstract shapes to realistic scenery. But other senses can also chime in. Audio hallucinations, for example. Hearing people talk gibberish or hearing music, or just loud noise, it can all happen. When you try to explore these it's a very fine line between paying so much attention that you wake yourself up again, and just slipping into sleep too deeply and just losing consciousness.

In my perception CEV can originate from different sources, at the same time, and be fused into one CEV experience.\n\n* \"real\" CEV induced by the drug messing with the visual cortex, or formexample, as you mentioned, by mechanical stimulation of the retina, by pressing your eyes etc.\n* Your imagination. You can imagine/visualize stuff sober and see it with your inner eye, without actually seeing it. Hypnagogic pseudohallucinations when falling asleep at first seem to lack any plasticity too and seem to be transitioning into the first category as you fall asleep.\n* Synesthesia with other senses. I feel like this is especially prevalent with dissociatives like ketamine. At times, especially when you just closed your eyes and start letting yourself drift off, the CEV seem heavily inspired by your sense of the shape of your body/tactile sense. Which then twist 's and turns, and you somehow have a feeling of the shape of your body, visualizing it in a way without really seeing it. Same goes for music. I often muse about the tone of music, and in my mind sounds have a texture, a complex \"shape\" and 3d form that I can almost-but-not-quite see before my inner eye.\n\nI feel like the \"real\" CEV will always be the dominant factor, if present, but the other 3 sources will also always contribute to the overall content of your CEV. But it is a very diffuse line between what you \"visualize\" before your innermeye and what you \"really\" see. And we have to remember that even what we see, even what we see with open eyes is already heavily edited and not the \"raw data\". Pattern recognition, recognition of shapes and 3d space, even stuff like emotional value can influence how you percieve something through the visual sense.", "replies": {"fy30t6i": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/honikw/observations_on_closed_eye_visuals_phenomenon_not/fy30t6i/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1594793711.0, "body": "Yeah very well said. I find ketamine to have this enormous sense of visual proprioception also. \n\nFor me the structural limitations mean the types tending to stick to their boundaries. For example I will not graphically see CEVs whilst eyes are open that include photo realistic images or dreamscapes, however I could easily see an overlay of \"neon\" type cartoon images overlayed but even then it's very apparent they are in a separate visual space despite if they integrate well with my OEVs. \n\nI feel like the CEVs have some significant power over the manifestation of your \"visual\" being but it takes some serious power to be over-riding our built in capacity for sight. Also yeah I agree it is situational on the question *are you seeing X\"\n\nSometimes you are, sometimes not so much even if you can \"visualize it\". Often the only way for me to tell if it's a mental **internalisation** vs a contribution to my actual visual-scape is by tricking my brain by either glancing into the dark breifly, or blinking fast ect. From this point they just magnify themselves and your brain kinda goes \"what's the point in differentiating\" so I'll frequently now get neon dots and shapes forming open eyed even after just a good blast of weed.", "replies": {}}}}, "fxiybfg": {"score": 4, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/honikw/observations_on_closed_eye_visuals_phenomenon_not/fxiybfg/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1594414393.0, "body": "Sorry my dude but imo, you are also more or less throwing out your opinion. Who says that CEVs are limited to the things you listed. What if I did 4 tabs and experienced some sort of Hallucination with my eyes closed that does not fall into your definition ?

For example I had an experience on 2CB that imo does not really fall into any of the categories (also not a mix of those) and I think many have had such experiences, they are just generally hard to put into words.

Add on heavy alcohol use at least a handle every week of JD or vodka, with promethazine and Hydroxyzine here and there too.

Slow taper with Diclazepam: as mentioned above. It has a longer half life and is less inebriating than Diazepam/Valium. Ashton manual protocols were followed (5-10% dosage reductions every 2-4 weeks). The reduction from a high dose to 1mg daily is easy enough without taking too much time, but the last milligram is brutal and can take years to successfully withdraw from. I unfortunately rushed my taper by opting to quit at 0.5mg only a few months into my taper. \n\n2. Flumazenil, DHM, Ibogaine, Salvia, Amentoflavone, 9-Me-BC: for the recoupling of the BZD-GABAA receptor complex and reseting your reward system via hormesis. **Important Note**: Rushing a benzo taper can ruin your reward system semi-permanently due to excess dysphoria for prolonged periods of time. There's also a chance you never recover and never resensitize no matter how long you wait. The worse your protracted withdrawals, the lower the chance there is of resensitizing fully by yourself. That's why you want to avoid bad protracted withdrawals, they really mess up your reward system to the point that you may need daily prescription amphetamines to function at all. The literature has clearly shown that heroin addicts might not die from heroin withdrawals cold turkey, but going through that can really ruin people's brains, they never get back to normal after \"toughing it out\". They develop hyperalgesia, reward deficits, and their long term prospects for overcoming the addiction is worse. Similar but different stuff happens for benzodiazepines.\n\n\n3. Cerebrolysin, Cortexin, BPC-157, TB-500, Semax, Selank, Ipamorelin + CJC1295 no DAC, GHK-Cu, Etifoxine, Emoxypine, Afobazole, Noopept, Bromantane, NSI-189, Intranasal Insulin, Magnesium L-Threonate, Agmatine, Jiaogulan @98% Gypenosides for general brain restoration, recovery and resensitization.\n\n4. Theanine, Taurine, Lemon Balm, Baicailin, Magnolia Bark, Oleamide, Nigella Sativa (Black Seed Oil), Ashwagandha (KSM-66), Progesterone (orally micronized): for general anxiolysis, mood support, and sleep enhancement.\n\nI've had over 1.5 years of experience now with protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. [It can really take multiple years for a full recovery](https://imgur.com/a/VpGwhI4), but even then [there are notable cognitive deficits 4 years after cessation of benzos according to a recent meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29244060/). \n\nOut of all the things I've tried, I would say that Imadezenil is hands down the best tool to use. I've found it to provide the most relief and efficacy, moreso than a long-acting benzo. It basically gets rid of 80% of benzo withdrawal symptoms without actually acting like a benzo (in other words, it helps withdrawals and you can use it to taper without actually using a long half-life benzo). The above background threads do a great job of explaining its mechanism of action and pharmacology, but it's basically a BZDr partial agonist that only acts on specific subreceptors of GABAA (\u03b12 for anxiolysis) and (\u03b15 for anticonvulsant properties). There's no tolerance whatsoever from what I can tell, and this makes perfect sense being a partial agonist that only targets specific GABAA subreceptors. There's no activity at \u03b11 which means there's no sedative-hypnotic effect and no amnesia/cognitive deterioration. It also acts via hormesis to recouple the BZD-GABAAr complex (similar to flumazenil but far more effective and safe from experience).

I'm assuming you're already done with your taper, so Imadezenil would be pointless. I'd recommend the following protocol:\n\n1. 50mg Bromantane sublingual once daily: it boosts your natural biosynthesis of dopamine in the brain without acting as a traditional stimulant via neurotransmitter release/reuptake inhibition. It upregulates the two key enzymes responsible for dopamine biosynthesis in the brain: TH and AAAD. This absolutely needs to be your first and foremost option before resorting to daily prescription amphetamines.\n\n2. 5mL Cerebrolysin + 5mg Cortexin (dissolved together) intramuscularly once daily. This is the most powerful neuropeptide combination for overall brain restoration and recovery of various systems. It is very well studied in Russia and indicated for many neurodegenerative diseases. It is even prescribed in children. There is a ton of literature on both these compounds, take your time on Sci-Hub and read some full texts if you're willing.\n\n3. 500ug BPC-157 subcutaneously daily for the same reasons as above, but mainly acting on the dopaminergic axis.\n\n4. 40mg NSI-189 Phosphate for general depression and anhedonia.\n\n5. 7.5mg Mirtazapine sublingual every night before bed if you have insomnia or sleep quality issues.\n\n6. Last but not least, if the above don't work, then a strong KOR such a Ibogaine or Salvia can be used to reset your reward system in the case of heroin withdrawals. Anecdotes show that it works very well in past heroin addicts under the right setting (psychotherapy). This is the most invasive protocol by far in this list. This does not work as a miracle cure in the case of benzo withdrawals unfortunately.\n\n6. Worst case scenario, you can try explaining your situation to a competent physician but I doubt you'll be able to find an expert in this field who truly understands the reason you need dopaminergic stimulants. You should request low dose Vyvanse and stick with the lowest effective dose. It's the smoothest prescription stimulant and releases just the right amount of dextroamphetamine into your bloodstream every few mins irrespective of your stomach pH. You have to be willing to work with your physician and be patient with this - you'll likely get started on 20-30mg Vyvanse. Dexedrine XR Spansules are also a viable option but not as smooth pharmacokinetically as Vyvanse. I would avoid Adderall due to heavy noradrenergic side effects from levoamphetamine and would also avoid any NDRI's such as Ritalin and Wellbutrin - they do not provide the same dopaminergic push that classic dextroamphetamine provides, which is much needed in this specific scenario.", "replies": {}}}}, "fqhn7ut": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gihbao/imidazenil_the_fastest_way_to_recovery_benzo/fqhn7ut/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1589409233.0, "body": "I have it in my head that using a kappa agonist while dependent on mu agonists would precipitate withdrawal - you seem well read, can you tell me one way or the other?", "replies": {}}}}}}, "fqftsgs": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gihbao/imidazenil_the_fastest_way_to_recovery_benzo/fqftsgs/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1589360345.0, "body": "This is awesome", "replies": {}}, "g1f4rjk": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gihbao/imidazenil_the_fastest_way_to_recovery_benzo/g1f4rjk/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597419644.0, "body": "**r/Pyrazolam**", "replies": {}}, "fqgwwjq": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gihbao/imidazenil_the_fastest_way_to_recovery_benzo/fqgwwjq/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1589388764.0, "body": "I dont think its the way to go.

The \u03b11 subunit has the biggest downstream impact at the BZD receptor leading to sedation, cognitive impairment and amnesia. This is exactly what leads to long-lasting protracted withdrawals (strong \u03b11 agonists being Clonazolam, Flualprazolam, and Flunitrazolam for example).

I've tried Flumazenil extensively (IV with the aid of a nurse) - it does help recouple the BZD-GABAA system faster but it doesn't let you get off benzos completely. Instead, I found Imidazenil to be far more effective as a partial agonist in the presence of a full agonist (Diazepam/Diaclazepam), where Imidazenil ends up acting a **competitive antagonist** just like Flumazenil but only negates sedation and cognitive impairment of traditional \u03b11 agonism rather than reducing seizure treshold.", "replies": {"fqh482z": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gihbao/imidazenil_the_fastest_way_to_recovery_benzo/fqh482z/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1589396053.0, "body": "The study points to the fact that a2 and a3 agonism still contributes to tolerance, but only minor.\n\nI dont know why you state that flumazenil doesnt let you get off benzos completely.

The problem is that these drugs just mask existing symptoms and create another dependence via GABAB agonism. There is no sustainable GABAergic that can be used long-term without dependence and subsequent withdrawals. Even Tiagabine and Gabaxodol are not exempt from this. I would opt to use oral micronized progesterone (200mg with food before bed) as it improves sleep architecture similarly to GHB in both men and women, has minimal tolerance/dependence, and provides much needed inhibitory neurosteroids that are missing during benzo withdrawals (specifically allopregnanolone).\n\nAs far as a2 agonists, calcium and sodium channel blockers, you're better off using a truly selective drug that target what you're looking for. For blood pressure, the best antihypertensive is Nebivolol (Bystolic) under 5mg. It is ultraselective as a b1 antagonist and provides anxiolysis via winding down the adrenergic system (via modulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system). \n\nThe goal with benzo withdrawals should be to minimize protracted symptoms/interdose withdrawals, which is why a long acting benzo with 5-10% reductions every 2-4 weeks is the recommended taper approach. Unfortunately, some people still experience protracted symptoms for years due to sedative-hypnotic kindling (due to frequent daily interdose withdrawals with a short acting benzo), or by tapering too quickly and suffering through it.

What parents tell you about yourself from a young age many times becomes repeated thoughts in your own head whether you realize it or not. \"I'm not good enough\", \"I don't deserve to be happy\" are thought patterns that develop in those situations. \n\nBut yes, I have been homeless before, I have lost the financial/emotional support of my parents after I turned 18 basically. Some of this was due to my drug use and offshoots of things that caused. But regardless, I had to fend for myself while being completely broke. It is not a good experience because you feel like no one cares about you, the support many people have while they begin to navigate life as an adult is lost which is more important than people realize.\n\n I had to basically take out loans for school, while working a shitty ass job, while living in a room shared by another person because I had no choice. I used drugs to numb the pain, I loved drugs more than anything, because they gave me the feeling of warmth, support, I felt like at least  someone cared about me. I was obsessed with pharmacology, Chemistry, basically reading about Chemistry/pharmacology all the time 24/7. I used it as a means to distract myself, so even while I was going to school for Biochemistry, I still read pharmacology for fun. I scratched and clawed my way out of this shitty hole I was in. I'm still not in the greatest situation financially, but I'm a lot better than I was. I'm 26 right now. \n\nI believe that I was able to find myself through those hard times, find what I like to do, find who I truly am. It made me a strong person, full of compassion and understanding. I wouldn't change a thing because I wouldn't be the person I am now without it, even through all the severe depression and anxiety. \n\nAlso, you're talking to the right person, I just had to apply for unemployment benefits in California and I know everything about it because I read literally everything I possibly could about every unique situation there is. You definitely want unemployment!  They are giving people 600$ + the base amount up until the end of July and then you just get base pay after that. If your hours got cut because of Corona, you even qualify for unemployment benefits back payed, so don't sell yourself short if that happened to you. And you would still get the 600$ for all those weeks if you qualified for at least 1$ of unemployment. \n\nAre you a citizen of the United States?\n(You can ask me anything about unemployment if you need some help applying.)", "replies": {"fr0ngrj": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gihbao/imidazenil_the_fastest_way_to_recovery_benzo/fr0ngrj/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1589830378.0, "body": "Wwll we'll see how things go for me.\n\nI'm not in the US, I'm in Europe, but my benefits will be okay for me for the next few months, If i get approved of course.", "replies": {"fr2z6th": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/gihbao/imidazenil_the_fastest_way_to_recovery_benzo/fr2z6th/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1589875542.0, "body": "Well,.

After I got to [350ug] , I dropped to zero no problem. I had minimal PAWS (so minimal it could have been \"reverse placebo\") for about a month and then I was completely fine. Somehow I doubt that extra 150ug would have made a significant difference considering I also dropped from [~700ug] to [~350ug].\n\nI get that everyone's body chemistry is different, so maybe I'm just really lucky, but I didn't even give it a second thought at the time.

Here is the article. And the bottim right guy is the one responsible for the best 2008-2010 Chinese mephedrone. https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-21785589\n\nThe group imported sodium 2-oxo-3 phenylglycidate, which is not an illegal substance, to use in the manufacture of BMK, which would then be turned into amphetamines. Elizabeth Jenkins from the Crown Prosecution Service said: \u2022\u2022!!!!\"These defendants were not run-of-the-mill drug dealers, this was pioneering work.!!!!\u2022\u2022 so this mother fucker was kind of a Dexter. Thats why Eric Chang had the cheapest and the best drone at that time. He was the main supplier. And that says all. Imagine that for a rc which was perfectly legal what means to dominate a market full of chemical factories like China. Also Preban being impure is certainly false. Was actually @99.7-99.9(I m refering to the best batches) there are few official raports and nmr s done on it. Also none of the nowadays batches have been tested for chirality. Only for purity. There are some puzzle pieces which arr missing or are missplaced intentionally by governments who have given every efforts to ban it. The price, effectiveness and purity made it to be most dangerous enemy for old illegal drugs supply. Mephedrone administration caused about a 500% increase in dopamine, and about a 950% increase in serotonin. 950% means higher than mdma. Wich none of the nowadays batches provide. Guys trust me I had a lot of drone at that time and since was banned I search for it everywhere and have read since then every possible forum. Even right after the ban All the people on forums arround 2012 complain about not being the same. So the tolerance/nostalgy/burned receptors dont stand. I really hope that one day someone with a good budget will hire a really professional chemist and will dispose him a fully equiped lab to made Again that holygrail of euphoric stimulants.

I frequently see questions on this relatively common stim, a fluorinated phenmetrazine derivate. After having explored 3-FPM for more than 6 months in a lot of different circumstances I am feeling informed enough on my worst and best friend to write a pretty accurate description of it. \n\nTo have a global and objective point of view I had human guinea pigs to test various hypothesis/waverings. I wrote parts of the review while being on 3-FPM, others when sober and some during comedown not to miss any information. \n\nIt is going to be long af so **you can go to the part which interests you with headlines and summary.** (I cut some useless parts from too much 3-FPM and the urge to talk, but still is very long). \n\n*If you think something is missing/inaccurate just explain and tell me to edit, the goal is to help unexperienced users against the (unfortunate) lack of informations on drugs.*\n\n                                         *Enjoy!*\n\n***\n\n# Summary :\n\n### 1. Pros and Cons\n### 2. Effects (positive/neutral/negative) \n### 3. ROA\u2019s and dosage\n### 4. Harm reduction \n### 5. Interactions and tolerance\n### 6. Sleep\n### 7. Personal appreciation \n\n***\n\n## 1. Pros and Cons :\n\n*I tried to be objective not to encourage drug use nevertheless almost all of the cons are not a problem if you are responsible on your use and apply harm reduction.*\n    \n***\n     \n\n### Pros :\n\n+ Amazingly efficient to work/clean your house/do anything you put off until a later time\n+ Minor side effects (unfeelable on moderate doses)\n+ Discreet (only thing that could make others suspicious is the will to talk for as long as you can)\n+ Low price (*kind of* a cheap cocaine, similar but way less euphoria)\n+ Really functional stim with really mild euphoria\n+ Low releaser of serotonin (EC50 value of 2558 nM)\n+ Eating isn\u2019t unbearable even on high doses (unlike 3-MMC or meth)\n+ Perfectly smooth for chemsex\n+ Nice after a rough day/night if you need to be productive/active\n+ Potency is not too high nor too low (eyeballing is pretty safe, even though I don\u2019t recommend it)\n+ Little or no physical dependency (worst I have felt are tremors and moderate fever/headache, hours after comedown, postponed to later when redosing).\n\n***\n\n### Cons :\n\n- Tolerance going up fast\n- Craving is *VERY* strong \n- Really caustic for nasal mucosa/mouth\n- Long lasting residual stimulation (be aware of insomnia)\n- Short duration (contributes to craving)\n- Fatigue is felt two days later after last dose (you won\u2019t really be tired the following day of use even with insomnia, but the day afterwards : can be insidious)\n- Fiendish : too few negative effects at first which leads to overconsumption (worse if it lasts multiple days), until you feel them. Can be hard when comedown arrives after binging (anxiety and more) so you redose even more. The addiction potential of this RC is one of the worst. I fell in it when receiving my very first batch (months ago) but learned to control my consumption over time (and fell again later).\n\n***\n\n## 2. Effects (postive/neutral/negative) :\n\n**This list is every single effect on my mental or physical state I/my human guinea pigs have experienced (they took 3 days in a row maximum with light to high doses) from low dosage once in a day to heavy abuse during up to 17 days for me (with only 2 days clean in between day 1 and day 17). The whole time of use is 6 months.**\n\n\n*Note that my worst binge (stated above) made me write nearly half of the negative effects. This drug abuse is unsuitable and potentially dangerous, I share my experimentations for educational purposes only, for users to limit risks of 3-FPM intake. The postitive/neutral/negative scale is strictly personal. All effects won\u2019t be felt at once : they are not systematic, and variable between one user and another.* \n\n***\n\n### Positive effects :\n\n- Mood boost\n- Motivation enhancement \n- Wakefulness\n- Little euphoria (with snorting rush)/ real euphoria (high dosage)\n- Increased focus \n- Work efficiency\n- Increased libido (high dosage)\n- Sexual pleasure enhancement\n- Ego inflation/Feeling powerful (high dosage)\n- Music enhancement\n- Smoking appreciation enhanced\n- Disinhibition (will to talk *a lot* to everyone)\n- Pleasant crackling on the upper side of your head \n- Improved reflexes (I did some testing, I am a fully right-hander and I could catch amazingly well with my left hand e.g.).\n\n***\n\n### Neutral effects :\n\n- Time distortion (goes fast)\n- Raised body temperature (neutral to some extent)\n- Nystagmus (high dosage/use with lack of sleep)\n- Pupil dilatation/mydriasis (rather during comedown, goes away if redosing)\n- Visual brightness enhancement\n- Little visual hallucinations (high dosage/use with lack of sleep)\n- Appetite suppressant (moderate/high dose, dose-d\u00e9pendent)\n- Nicotine craving increased (tobacco and e-cig).\n\n***\n\n### Negative effects :\n\n*Quite long list but most of them are light or inexistant without redosing/binging :*\n\n- Vasoconstriction (with cold/numb feet and fingers) \n- Increased/abnormal heartbeat (more on the comedown, arythmic rather with high dosage)\n- High craving \n- Frequent urination \n- Penis shrinkage (can make urination a bit difficult at high dosage, lasts up to 12-14 hours but is completely reversible don\u2019t worry)\n- Dry mouth \n- Dehydration \n- Increased sweating\n- Different sweat smell/stress sweat (high dosage, not for the best...)\n- Insomnia/difficulties to sleep (more details below)\n- Dizziness (heavy dosage/lack of sleep)\n- Flu-like symptoms (multiple days of use)\n- Stuffy nose/bleeding nose (multiple days of use/with insufficient cleaning)\n- Canker sores (Sublingual ROA)\n- Teeth grinding (high dosage/more during sleep)\n- Acne apparition (after at least a week of use with high dosage), vanishing 2-4 days after stopping 3fpm\n- Fever/headache (rather with redosing/multiple days of use)\n- Chest pain (multiple days of use/high dosage, throbbing pain)\n- Shortness of breath (multiple days of use/heavy dosage) up to 4 days\n- Impossible erection (high dosage/paradoxically possible with higher dosage because libido is too high)\n- Anxiety/irritability (high dosage/multiple days of use/lack of sleep)\n- Tremors (high dosage/multiple days of use/lack of sleep)\n- Obsessive compulsive conducts (high dosage).\n\n***\n\n*One of the guinea pigs couldn\u2019t stop biting his nails or his lips (both nearly to blood) on moderate/high dosage, no one else had this side effect. I was the only one to have acne (which I never really had in my life) and sometimes feel obsessive compulsive disorder symptoms (urge to clean, to make everything symmetrical, to do smth one way and absolutely not the opposite), probably because of the higher dosages I took, on a longer time. Other negative effects due to abusive consumption (long use/heavy dosage/lack of sleep) also emerged almost exclusively for me.*\n\n\n**We have not felt side effects which lasted more than 3-4 days. The longest lasting ones are acne (after binging a lot, which seems to come back if you binge again without waiting for tolerance to lower), arythmic heartbeat and shortness of breath. This doesn\u2019t mean at all no irreversible effect exists, especially cardiovascular damages.**\n\n***\n\n## 3. ROA\u2019s and dosage :\n\n*Dosages indicated below are with zero tolerance unless mentioned. They depend on stimulants use habits, metabolism/weight differences thus they become vague. These are still a good estimation however always start low and take more if you want, once you are sure the dose won\u2019t be too much.*\n\n\n\n### Graph with I.N/Oral/Sublingual/Smoked basic informations (slide on your left to see every ROA\u2019s if you don\u2019t) :\n\nUse case\u00a0\u00bb ROA | Intranasal | Oral | Sublingual | Smoked\n:--|:--:|:--:|:--:| --:\n*Threshold dosage* | 8mg | 15mg | 5mg | ?\n*Moderate dosage* | 25mg | 40mg | 20mg | ?\n*Highest tested at one go with tolerance* | 200mg | 150mg | 75mg | 50mg\n*Rush* | YES | NO | LITTLE | YES\n*Onset duration* | 3-5 minutes | 15-30 minutes | 5-8 minutes | 2-4 minutes\n*Peak duration* | 20-45 minutes | 1-2 hours | 30-50 minutes | 10-30 minutes\n*Residual stimulation duration (~)* | 4-8 hours | 5-9 hours | 4-7 hours | 3-6 hours\n*Craving* | +++++ | ++ | +++ | ++++\n\n\n**After onset and peak, you will still have effects which lessen with time. Once the peak is finished, craving is at its maximum.**\n\n*Residual stimulation is pretty hard to tell, it really depends on your fatigue, on the dosage, if you redose or sometimes for no apparent reason. I could feel it up to 14 hours on heavy dosage with a lot of redosing. Anyway if you wait 6 hours or more before going to sleep it won\u2019t really affect the time required to fall asleep from what I have experienced. You could still sleep less/ have a worst sleep quality.* \n\n***\n\n### Intranasal : \n\n>Hurts a lot, but the pain goes away in 1-2 minutes. Your eye will produce a small tear and feel some crackling in your head for 30s. You eventually get used to it, and could even enjoy the pain at some time (Happened to me, I guess my brain assimilates the pain to the dopamine release ~~or I am a full masochist~~). Little rush of stamina and euphoria for few seconds, probably because of the pain + placebo of snorting. The drop of chemical slowly getting down your throat after 5-10 minutes can be disgusting. Few of my human guinea pigs often felt instant mild/moderate headache that lasted and ducked the positive effects.\n\nFunctional dose between 15mg and 50-75mg (heavy, depending on people and stim experience), higher doses will lower productivity and becomes useless for work because you brain will be too active and your thoughts will go all over the place.\n\n*With tolerance :*\n- I went up to 200mg at once (4 successive lines), nice ego inflation and high visual brightness, high heartbeat, music is pleasant and I talked *A LOT*. Nice feeling and a little comedown without redosing (mostly fatigue).\n- During an entire session (maybe 11-12hours) I took about up to 1.5g, the next day I had a pretty bad comedown and my heartbeat was arythmic. I obviously couldn\u2019t sleep. Euphoria is reachable on heavy dosage but it\u2019s not worth it, you should rather get a recreative stim. \n\nOne of my friends emptied a nasal spray (initially used for stuffy nose) and made a 3-FPM solution. This RC has a high water solubility, it was 70mg/mL to get about 10mg per spray. You could probably dose even more. This method allows a discret use but is really nice because you don\u2019t have to clean a lot your nose, it lowers burns/bleeding. Craving still is high and you might redose even more.\n\n**The craving is worst than everything I have ever tried (2-FMA, 3-MMC, cocaine e.g.), because side effects doesn\u2019t appear instantly. Don\u2019t use it for its euphoria and remind yourself that you will pay the consequences of the positive effects later.**\n\n***\n\n### Oral : \n\n>You don\u2019t get any rush but I guess that is the price to pay for better safety (it doesn\u2019t make 3-FPM use safe). The come up is fast compared to most of oral-taken other drugs. Not much to say about this one, classic effects for this ROA : longer peak duration and residual stimulation, smoother comedown and *WAY* less craving.\n\nSurely is the safest ROA, and the best to work/be productive. Functional dosage is between 25-120mg (heavy, too much for non experienced users).\n\n*With tolerance :* \n- I took up to 150mg ~~only~~, didn\u2019t seem to be useful to take more for productivity, your heartbeat races even more than snorting at heavy dosage. I guess more will make you unproductive and worried about your heart. \n- Maximum I took in a single day (on maybe 10 hours) is approximately up to 300mg, it\u2019s not mild but way less than intranasal, because of the lower craving. Productivity was still better than I.N. binges with less disordered thoughts. Side effects are also reduced, could sleep with benzos.\n\n\n**Note that moderate/high doses can lead to mild/moderate gastric reflux, unpleasant when going to bed. This is a normal effect linked to the drug\u2019s acidity against your stomach. You can lessen this side effect by laying on your left side and elevate your head. Eating a least a bit when using obviously helps. I don\u2019t know about anti-gastric reflux medecine interactions, should be safe.**\n\n***\n\n### Sublingual : \n\n>3-FPM\u2019s chemical taste is pretty bad but few seconds after the powder melts under your tongue with increased saliva secretion, the taste is way better (~~and you could like it with time~~). The bitterness is still felt but it\u2019s mostly pleasant. You have to keep the substance a bit in your mouth so that it absorbs and doesn\u2019t become an oral ROA (15s to 45s). Smooth rush however I find this method to be much more euphoric that the others. Seems to be nicer to your heart, with less stimulation. \n\nProbably not the best to work/study, but moderate dose is about 10-25mg. \n\n*With tolerance :*\n- I went up to 75mg at once, feel awakened and a confident, light but pleasant euphoria. I haven\u2019t redosed a lot with this ROA (max 120mg), because canker sores are appearing pretty fast (remember it\u2019s caustic, cleaning your mouth might help). \n- Combined with your tongue moving around in your mouth, your teeth feel like razor blades on high dosage resulting in pain and sleep difficulties. Some guinea pigs didn\u2019t have canker sores at small/moderate dosage without redosing.\n\n**I like this ROA but mouth damages are really bad, avoid to do it a lot.**\n\n***\n\n### Smoked (not vaped) :\n\n>I only tried this ROA a few times and I don\u2019t recommend it. Effects aren\u2019t bad, nice but classic rush of smoking stimulants, nevertheless really mild. \n\n**However smoking 3-FPM has almost instant lungs damages even with light/moderate dosage. Causticity here you go again. You can feel it few hours later and the next day(s) with cough and some pain/unpleasant flu like lungs symptoms (flu like symptoms also appears with other ROA\u2019s but on heavy dosage/multiple days of use).**\n\n***\n\n### Intravenous and intramuscular :\n\n>*I haven\u2019t tried neither but I don\u2019t recommend it at all. You should know 3-FPM is caustic (~~if you read my post~~), so your veins/muscles will probably be seriously damaged. If I.V. or I.M. is your thing, forget this RC.*\n\n**If you have experienced these ROA\u2019s (+boofed and vaped), feel free to add a comment/mp me to enrich my post.**\n\n***\n\n## 4. Harm reduction :\n\n- Please clean your nose well (with saline solution, 20-30min after every line if possible, and a tissue). I know sometimes you forget or get lazy but the mucous membrane of your nose will thank you in the future. If your nose bleeds whereas you cleans it, give it some rest and try to get a nasal spray to clean it better. Healing cream should be applied when you feel burning sensations in your nose.\n\n- If you are going to redose 3-FPM in a day, organize your doses before taking the first one. If you have a safely planned redosing schedule (and you have mental strengh to keep following it ~~lmao~~), side effects will be significantly decreased/erased.\n\n- Avoid multiple days of use, try to space your doses. When you abuse 3-FPM and the comedown is hard, take a benzo OR *a little bit* of alcohol (DON\u2019T DO BOTH) and go see some friends/do something that makes you happy!\n\n- All the classics about stims\u2019 harm reduction (don\u2019t share your straw with others if you snort it/try to sleep at least 7-8hours if you use it for multiple days/don\u2019t go exercise for your heart...).\n\n- Always have some benzodiazepine with you when using 3-FPM. When you feel your heartbeat going up or if a sudden comedown happens, it will reduce anxiety a lot. Sublingual is the best way, fast action and high bioavailability. Try to have blotters/caps/unidose, anything already prepared and well dosed : if you need to take some because you are feeling bad, eyeballing/weighting benzo powder is risky. Call a trusted person to check on you if needed.\n\n- However be careful with benzos. They are really useful against comedown and to sleep better but benzodiazepines\u2019 physical addiction can lead to seizures. The better is to use it only in major cases. If 3-4mg etizolam can\u2019t make you sleep (no tolerance), sorry boy you won\u2019t sleep tonight.  Instead of taking 50mg etizolam and blackout, begin slowly and gradually and wait 10-15 minutes until you are sure redosing is safe and useful. You could do regrettable stuff.\n\n- Hydrate a lot, it prevents headache, too high body temperature and dizziness. It\u2019s obvious water is essential for your health but frequent urination could make you think drinking less will be better. Drastic dehydration can lead to important consequences on your body. Avoid sodas which can fight dry mouth but won\u2019t help you hydration.\n\n- Don\u2019t forget to eat. Appetite-suppressant activity of 3-FPM is strong but you can force yourself pretty easily. It will reduce side effects and lack of nutrition can badly affect your health. You might lose weight if using for multiple days (it decreases fast, even when eating a bit because you don\u2019t realize how much your appetite lessens). When solid food is unbearable, try soft/liquid food (mashed potatoes/soup/...).\n\n- Take supplements to help your brain refill its noradrenaline and dopamine stock. Long-term use of 3-FPM will reduce future neurotransmitters\u2019 release, and probably becomes neurotoxic. These supplements help to have a enhanced experience with less negative effects (short and long term). Click on the [Supplementation Guide to Stimulants](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/45yjs9/supplementation_guide_to_stimulants/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf), not mine but it\u2019s really complete, a nice step for harm reduction!\n\n- Remember 3-FPM isn\u2019t caffeine. ~~Just a little line every morning is fine~~ **spoiler** >!No it\u2019s not.!<\n\n- Try to keep a healthy lifestyle, including sleep, food and water obviously. Have a minimum physical living as taking a walk (while listening to some music e.g.). Complete health includes social and mental states, don\u2019t isolate yourself from the outside world.\n\n- Avoid intense physical activity if effects are still noticeable (obviously no sports), use of stimulants on heavy dosage can result in heart attacks. Sexual activity is fine nevertheless calm things down if your heart is racing.\n\n- Stressful situations can make your heart go crazy combined with 3-FPM use. Avoid to take any doses if you know a potentially stressful event is coming.\n\n- To make sure your fresh batch is 3-FPM, the best is to do [Reagent tests](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReagentTesting/comments/6swtgw/3fpm_reagent_test_results_marquis_mandelin/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf). If you can\u2019t, at least do allergy tests by taking small amounts (0,5-1mg/smallest you can do), waiting several hours then going up to a bit more and waiting again.\n\n\n>**No deaths from 3-FPM overdoses (without other substances) have been reported for now, please don\u2019t be the first one, by acting responsibly.**\n\n***\n\n## 5. Interactions and tolerance :\n\n\n###     Tested interactions :\n\n- **Ketamine + 3-FPM :** \n>I had done the stim during the whole day and did 150mg and then 200mg of K snorting. Moving is a bit easier than a normal K trip, you are a less sedated to the ground. However I had eaten so much nothing during the day that I felt a bit nauseous when drinking a lot of water at the end of the K peak. Not bad nor amazing, just to share this tested combo.\n\n- **Alcohol + 3-FPM :** \n>As with most of the stimulants, it hides the sedative effect from alcohol, making it a nice combo. Don\u2019t forget you still have alcohol in your blood, it doesn\u2019t make you able to drive (or use a dangerous machine e.g.). When the stim comes down you will feel the alcoholic effects from all you drank pretty fast, which can result in coma. Don\u2019t drink to much. This mix is pretty much the same as cocaine + alcohol (but cheaper).\n\n- **Cannabis + 3-FPM :** \n>(I quit smoking weed few years ago but some guinea pigs told me this) You will be stimulated and high until cannabis takes the lead, then you can sleep because the stimulation is less effective than the weed sedation. On high doses of both it\u2019s a pleasurable experience with stimulation but you can\u2019t use it for useful things, you will be productive to stupid stuff but it\u2019s fun (I did methylphenidate + weed few years ago and it feels pretty much the same).\n\n***\n\n###     Pharmacological/known dangerous interactions :\n\n- **Stimulants + 3-FPM :** \n>Seems obvious, mixing stimulants isn\u2019t a good idea. Potential synergy can lead to worsening side effects, worst hypertension and increased heartbeat so raised heart attack risk.\n\n- **MAOI\u2019s + 3-FPM :** \n>Their action (MAOI\u2019s) will prevent removing neurotransmitters (mostly noradrenaline, serotonin and dopamine) from your brain synapses.  3-FPM use releases noradrenaline, dopamine and small but still amounts of serotonin (EC50= NA:30, DA:43, 5-HT:2558. The lowest the number is, the highest the drug affinity with receptors inducing neurotransmitters\u2019 release is). This will result in a significant raise of their concentration in synapses to dangerous levels. Don\u2019t do it at any cost.\n\n- **Seizure threshold lowering substances (such as Tramadol) + 3-FPM :** \n>Can lead to a raised risk of seizure. Could be fatal.\n\n- **Psychedelics (Tryptamines, phenylethylamines, lysergamides, 2C-X) + 3-FPM :** \n>Stimulants mixed with psychedelics can lead to paranoia/psychosis/panic attacks. I guess mixing it with dissociatives which have psychedelics-like effects (3-HO-PCE e.g.) will lead to mania and psychosis too.\n\n- **25xNBOH/25xNBOMe + 3-FPM :** \n>\u00ab\u00a0Members of the 25x family are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with stimulants should be avoided due to the risk of excessive stimulation. This can result in panic attacks, thought loops, seizures, increased blood pressure, vasoconstriction, and heart failure in extreme cases.\u00a0\u00bb (Psychonaut Wiki) \n\n***\n\n###     Tolerance :\n\n>It doesn\u2019t grow the same way for everybody for sure, and really depends on the dosage/if you redose/how much time you don\u2019t consume when you pause. I would say that the time of use is the most important factor (1,5g in one day will create less tolerance than 1g during 5 days e.g.). Beginning with zero tolerance, you will see its effects after 3-4 days of moderate/high dosage use. The first effect is the need to increase the dosage to feel the same way as day 0. After a week of high/heavy use, you need to double the dosage to feel the same and even more, because the peak will be 1,5 times/2 times less long. \n\n***\n\n###     Cross tolerance :\n\n>I can\u2019t tell you a lot my experience about this because I haven\u2019t used other stims during/following my binges. I took 3-MMC once (~450mg), after a 4/5 out of 7 days in a week of 3-FPM, and slightly felt less stimulation than I usually have.\n\n>3-FPM does have a cross tolerance with dopaminergic stimulants so their stimulation effects will be decreased if you used 3-FPM recently.\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n## 6. Sleep :\n\n*Really variable but I tried to generalize it. Sometimes for no apparent reason sleep will be harder than another. These are the 3 usual cases I experienced the most which can be helped with some tips (below) :*\n\n>1. Total insomnia when high/heavy dosage taken less than 2-3 hours before sleep (even with benzos).\n\n>2. Between 2 and 4 hours of sleep when moderate/high dosage taken less than 3-4 hours before sleep without benzo. \n\n>3. 8 hours or more when last dosage taken more than 4 hours before going to sleep with benzo. If heavy dosage, 2mg etizolam (or equivalent) works perfectly, if lower/moderate dosage no more than 1mg is needed.\n\n***\n\n### Tips to sleep well (Personal but can really change your sleep case) :\n\n- Shower before going to sleep (not too hot water)\n- Don\u2019t forget to urinate before going to sleep\n- Always have a benzo next to your bed \n- Hydrate yourself well/keep a glass (rather a full bottle) of water next to your bed \n- Wear long socks which are tight to help lower vasoconstriction (cold/numb feet)\n- Don\u2019t take your last dose less than 3hours at any cost before going to sleep\n- If your last dose is late, be mentally active the last hours before going to sleep : no reddit or netflix, but something that makes you think like work, video games (I guess some people won\u2019t agree however these are my observations)\n- Force yourself to eat something or you could wake up during your night, *really* hungry\n- Try to avoid sexual/physical activity less than 2hours before going to sleep: your heartbeat will be significantly raised for some time\n- However with high/heavy dosage libido can be so much enhanced that you should have sexual activity at least once in the day or you might not be able to sleep because of it\n- If you are a smoker, smoke one last cigarette less than 30minutes before going to sleep or it might make you get up\n- Don\u2019t wear too hot clothes in your bed, a t-shirt and underwear but not really more except for socks (loose  clothes are the best).

Discret, minor side effects and amazing productivity, I am easily distracted and it helped a lot for my work. To achieve a task or learn when you don\u2019t have the motivation or just to do it fast, it\u2019s absolutely perfect. \n\n>Nevertheless I lost more than 3kg during my 3 weeks use, and I forced myself to eat for every meal so really be careful. My cardiovascular system probably had some damage, I feel my cardio was a bit down for one week and chest pain/heart palpitations were a bit worrying sometimes. \n\n>At some point I began to use some, not just to study but to appreciate my cigarettes even more and feel in a better mood with ego inflation. My addiction was certain but it stayed psychological so stopping isn\u2019t impossible at all. I realized my 3-FPM time (long and beloved one...) has to end for at least some months. \n\n>I finished my college exams yesterday and have finished my last dose simultaneously. \n\n***\n\nMy holidays will now be dedicated to my arriving RC order (no functional stim lmao) :\n- Methallylescaline \n- AL-LAD \n- 3-MeO-PCE \n- 4-HO-MiPT \n- 5-MAPB \n- DOC blotters \n- 25E-NBOH (blotters btw)\n- 2C-D \n- and MXP + 5-MeO-DMT which were already waiting for me.\n\nI probably won\u2019t have time to test all of them (because I will try to space my uses obviously) but will write some TR on the most interesting ones!\n\n***\n\nI hope this could help, (I guess you won\u2019t have read everything but I understand ahah).\n\n*Stay safe!*\n\n>*Edit : a big thank you to everyone who wrote a comment on this post, it really is encouraging to do the same for other RC\u2019s!*\n\n>**The anonymous award as well was really nice, so I thank you too!**\n\n>*Long live this community of help and love.*", "author": "Poncho1478", "score": 117, "flair": null, "created": 1593034109.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/hf10l5/all_of_my_research_about_3fpm_6months/", "num_comments": 43, "title": "All of my research about 3-FPM (6months)", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fvvbbzw": {"score": 22, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/hf10l5/all_of_my_research_about_3fpm_6months/fvvbbzw/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1593047636.0, "body": "Dude what a great post!

I had one the first time I took 300mg in a gel capsule on an empty stomach. It took me a while to figure out what it was, and I actually went to the walk-in clinic after a month or so of the cramp feeling, and the doctor said I probably ripped my abdominal muscle.\n\nThen after 12 months or so, I researched again, and then due to consuming a couple g in a couple nights, I developed a burning sensation right behind my belly button, to the left 1\", It went away after a day or so, but I immediately knew it was an ulcer. The sharp burning went away, but there was a lingering crampish feeling for a while, maybe even a couple weeks. This highlights the caustic nature. It's very significant.\n\nI also had vasculitis at one point a couple years ago. SKin goes slightly raspberry-looking and for me the symptoms manifest in the calf muscles. It feels tight and achy.\n\nI also did 5g once in about a week, and I had relatively major leg pain from what I assume is vasculitis. I had trouble sleeping because my hamstrings and/or glutes were sustaining a dull pain. I found that 400mg ibuprofen allowed me to sleep. I suspect this vasculitis symptom is caused by blood vessel inflammation (and may or may not synergize with cialis for this symptom). It shows up in heroic doses over multiple days, depending on your phenotype. I would suggest for mitigation supplements such as taurine and other anti-inflammatory aids. For example, I suspect the immune system attacks the blood vessels as the source of radical emissions of dopamine. The immune system attacks somewhere that circulates globally in your body, possibly the central nervous system, so nerves may be inflamed rather than blood vessels.\n\nThe learning for me is that too much 3fpm over a short period will almost certainly lead to negative side effects outside what is described so far in your thread (prior to any further editing).\n\nI use it with cialis, usually about 12-25mg, and I also use 3fpm for tactile sensation reasons, usually stacked with 3mmc and thc. When I use 3fpm for productivity reasons, I might use 50mg every 4 hours. It's plenty to allow laser focus and problem-solving. I suspect it is highly affective against ADD. The slight stimulation seems to promote immersion.\n\nFor tactile sensations, a little 3mmc goes a long way, and thc is critical. For that I use about 200mg initially, then maybe 100mg per 2-3 hours. But tolerance runs away after the first day, so after that, I might dose 100mg every 15-30 mins until I start to rush.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI prefer oral and rectal administration for tactile purposes, but I use all 3 routes every time. Rectal dosing targets the lower body more so than oral, and oral targets the lower body more than nasal, but nasal can produce sharper onset. I recommend studying the concept of the laced butt plug for PC muscle pressure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is also extremely important to note that dopamine takes 1-2 hours to saturate receptors after the first initial dose, so dosing after that saturation occurs should only be for the purpose of prolonging it. It is possible to dose more than needed, after which I have concerns about vasoconstriction in the internal organs.", "replies": {}}, "g5xlcto": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/hf10l5/all_of_my_research_about_3fpm_6months/g5xlcto/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1600607695.0, "body": "Fantastic post", "replies": {}}, "fvunyo1": {"score": -1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/hf10l5/all_of_my_research_about_3fpm_6months/fvunyo1/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1593035753.0, "body": "Nice write up but a few grammar mistakes throughout that are misleading.\n\nAlso, the fact you didnt include vaped as one of the roa makes this summary incomplete, sorry lol", "replies": {"fvuoldj": {"score": 8, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/hf10l5/all_of_my_research_about_3fpm_6months/fvuoldj/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1593036112.0, "body": "ooops tell me more (english isn\u2019t my native language).\n\nYes I wanted to try vaped but I need to stop for now, and stealing from unknown people\u2019s TR isn\u2019t the point.", "replies": {}}, "fvuv1tt": {"score": 4, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/hf10l5/all_of_my_research_about_3fpm_6months/fvuv1tt/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1593039580.0, "body": "im sorry but i dont like smoking most chems as an roa.", "replies": {"fvuv9fj": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/hf10l5/all_of_my_research_about_3fpm_6months/fvuv9fj/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1593039690.0, "body": "Good.

However it is rather long and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a good way to write a TL;DR. \n\nPrevious posts, [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/i0p78y/methallyescaline_mal_dosage_effect_and_experience/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) and [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/i95hgn/a_funny_little_alexander_shulgin_anecdote_i_came/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) \n \nDose: 55mg Methallylescaline fumarate\nMilky grayish white crystalline powder.\nMy SO dosed 42mg 4-AcO-DMT.\nThis was the 15th, and I\u2019m writing this on the 18th.\n\nDropped around one in the afternoon. The come up started about 30 minutes after. Mild nausea, and physical stimulation appear first. The nausea never got past mild, and started to subside after I threw up about an hour after dropping. The physical stimulation, however, intensified exponentially. I would describe it as a rolling euphoria, coming in squirming waves. \n\nWe hopped in the shower when the come up was really ramping up. The heat and water really amped up that physical euphoria/stimulation. This is also perhaps the most sexual psych I\u2019ve ever taken. Even more then 5-MeO-MiPT which is typically thought to be one of the most sexual psychs. \n\nAfter the shower we went and laid on the bed, both reaching our peaks. This chem has the longest lasting peak I\u2019ve ever encountered. It was at least 3 hours. The headspace was light, like 100ug LSD. Visually it was like 300ug. Physically incomparable.\n\nThe OEVs were neat, but nothing special, somewhat like mushrooms, exactly like 4-HO-DET. The CEVs were the most interesting I\u2019ve ever encountered outside of DMT. They were very realistic, 3 dimensional spaces, with various creatures. Another thing about them was that I had the ability to influence what I was seeing. I would imagine a thing and it would slowly resolve into greater and greater clarity in my mind\u2019s eye.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve already spoke on the most noteworthy part of this drug, the physical euphoria/stimulation. It wasn\u2019t like speed or MDMA where it\u2019s very CNS head space euphoria. It was more peripheral, like waves of pulsing light moving up and down my body. This is by far the most stimulating physical ecstasy I\u2019ve ever experienced, and I\u2019ve taken quite a few physically intense psychedelics. It absolutely blew me away. To the point where I was having a lot of trouble focusing on the wonderfully rich CEVs. \n\nThe comedown was pleasant and clear headed. However, all the squirming and muscle spasms from the sheer euphoria of the compound left me feeling exhausted, I definitely burned somewhere close to 10,000 calories from this trip. I\u2019m 6\u20194 and 250lb beef boi, so I burn a lot of calories just existing, though. \n\nWe each took 500ug flualprazolam around 1am and slept till 10am the next day. There was a lot of muscle soreness the next day. I\u2019m still experiencing some mild muscle soreness writing this on day 3. \n\nOverall: This is my new favorite psychedelic. My previous favorite was 4-HO-MiPT. If it didn\u2019t have the come up nausea it would be an absolutely perfect psychedelic, in my book. I would recommend this to almost anyone with some experience. \n\nHowever, I think, based off of all the info I gathered before this trip, that it\u2019s not a worthwhile psychedelic if you take a light or even mild dose. I wouldn\u2019t call my dose a heroic one, but it was heavy. I think that\u2019s where a lot of the controversy/mixed reports are coming from. It seems the stimulation would be uncomfortable and the headspace would be boring with little visuals, if one took a light dose like 20-35mg. Also one\u2019s ability to deal with come up nausea, however it wasn\u2019t that difficult to deal with. I think you just gotta go in to this one rather strong to get the true magic out of it, making it atypical in that way.\n\nInterestingly, me and my SO came up and peaked at the same time, my peak lasted almost twice as long, but the come down was about the same. Of course we cut it short with the benzo, but it was 85% over by that point. So it seems it has a very similar timeline to 4-sub-tryptamines, despite some reports stating it was much longer. It seems that\u2019s mostly just referring to the peek. 8-10 hours is pretty accurate. 12-16+ seems unrealistic.\n\nEdit; I could write a lot more, so ask for as much clarification if you want.

I\u2019ll know more once I provide it to my SO or another friend in the future. \n\nI compared the headspace to 100ug to give the impression of intensity/difficulty to handle. However it\u2019s not representative of the \u201cflavor\u201d of the headspace. It\u2019s unique. I found it to be joyful and more suited to extrospection, making insightful observations, than introspection. At one point we were walking around outside and we started observing dragon flys. Notice that there was a male and a female doing a little mating ritual that involved some complex flying maneuvers, and talked on that and evolution for like 15 minutes. I also played my synth/piano at the peek of the trip, and found it very easy and played better than I have ever played before. Which I wouldn\u2019t claim if I was alone, but I had witnesses lol. \n\nLastly, me and my SO are very lucky in that, we are closer than any couple I\u2019ve ever encountered. I\u2019m not much for spirituality or spiritual speech, but the idea of the soul mate feels very real to us.

We use them both therapeutically and recreationally, the two aren\u2019t mutually exclusive IME. We both care about harm reduction and understanding what we are putting in our bodies, so we do a lot of research.

(anectodal 3x 2mg daily taken chronically by a person with sedative-hypnotic withdrawal kindling (!) experienced only very very mild wd). i suffer from heavy kindling too and once i ran out (got a little experimental before and went up to 12mg doses at times) and it definitely caused w/d to some extend, but it was a walk in a park. if i had taken that much etiz for the same amount of anxiolysis i would have been in hell now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmost reports i've seen state that the full benzo experience can't even be recreated with pago, unless gigantic doses are taken, suggesting some sort of ceiling effect, which would mean that even at chronic high dosing it would still induce way way less dependence than any benzo. (fyi, sedation correlates to alpha1 subunit containing BZD receptor activation, and alpha1 is also responsible for tolerance, amnesia, etc. hence the lack of side effects). i whish i would have found out about pago (or imidazenil, which is basically a perfect version of pago) before i let my self get addicted to fucking benzos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nat higher doses it gives one an interesting, but very subtle high, you feel sort of fuzzy in a way similar to benzos, just without much sedation, everything seems to be alright and i get in to this kind of flow-like-mode where everything just seems to fall into place natuarally, but you still feel like yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nalso it could be a very helpful tool for benzo recovery, i once ran out for like 36hrs and i still had like the tiredness, brain fog and some agition, but it was managable. most importantly there was only little anxiety. i've never gone more than 12 hrs without benzos tho before so i don't know how bad it would have been, but given etiz' short duration and the kindling i have it should have been much worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nall in all, it's a great chem with a huge potentional, so spread the word my boys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr: BZD partial agonist that produces little to no dependence and side effects (depending on the dose), but still has the anxiolytic action of regular BZD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\noff topic: fuck i should finally put the NEP pipe down and stop writing shit on reddit. its 4 am night 2 lol. so please excuse my stimy writing, will re-read tomorrow again basically brain dead rn. and with tomorrow i mean in like 16hrs lol\n\nedit: haha who am i kidding brb loading the next bowl\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nalso, how bad is detox gonna  be at 1mg/2h of etiz? how fucked am i? got an appointment on 23th and im scared shitless. considering the kindling and that even with drugs i feel so fucking lost, staying on the train till the day i dont wake up seems pretty alluring, i dont think i would survive any more of this. might as well finish it quick and numb.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nalso also, any ideas how to get imidazenil imported into the eu from the us? unfortunaly i live in germany. yeah. thanks merkel, cunt. falls under nps act, any ideas how to bypass customs, like mail forwarding or delivering to czech address and picking it up or something (god bless the EU, no customs)?", "author": "n-methyl-amphetameme", "score": 27, "flair": null, "created": 1584442418.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/fjxsu4/pagoclone_is_the_shit_as_anxiolytic_fuck_other/", "num_comments": 47, "title": "pagoclone is THE SHIT as anxiolytic, fuck other benzos (zero to no side effects, only slight dependence)", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fkpmw4h": {"score": 7, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/fjxsu4/pagoclone_is_the_shit_as_anxiolytic_fuck_other/fkpmw4h/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1584442767.0, "body": "I've been really glad to see this one hit the market.

For those who've never heard of this benzo, Flutazolam is classified as an oxazolobenzodiazepine much like Oxazolam, Cloxazolam, Mexazolam, and Haloxazolam. I managed to purchase 90 pharma grade Coreminal tablets from one of my vendors a long time ago with another Japanese benzo known as Rilmazafone and a few other Japanese pharmaceuticals, the Coreminal tablets contain 4 milligrams of Flutazolam and I've played around with various doses (4, 8, 12, and 16 milligrams) and tonight decided to shoot for 20 milligrams because it's a mild benzo said to be about as strong as Diazepam (Valium) but said to be more hypnotic and produces a more marked sedation and impaired coordination compared to Diazepam and as a result is used as a sleep aid in Japan.\n\n[https://imgur.com/oHNecps](https://imgur.com/oHNecps) \n\n10:30 PM: I take 20 milligrams (5 tablets) of Flutazolam on an empty stomach while watching the newest episode of Better Call Saul.\n\n10:45 PM: I notice it's onset as it has a fairly rapid onset of 10 to 15 minutes much like Alprazolam especially on an empty stomach of course.\n\n11:00 PM: I feel alot more relaxed now than I have all day because I've been stressing out about how my car won't start and worrying if i'm going to have to purchase a new part or two because my car is a piece of shit and not having the money to do so. So far it feels alot like Diazepam (Valium) or Lorazepam (Ativan) and in my trials with Flutazolam I personally don't find it hypnotic at all, in fact I find it be quite anxiolytic with nice muscle relaxing effects. Sleep could possibly come easier if I were to lie down and try to go to sleep but i'm definitely not fighting to stay awake and in my previous trials I should also note this benzo is a short lasting one that lasts 3 to 4 hours at the most.  \n\n11:35 PM: I play the song Escape From LA off The Weeknd's most recent album. The effects seemed to have reached their peak and i'm just chilling on the couch relaxing with my clingy cat rubbing up against me. \n\n12:15 AM: I'm kind of watching Dispatches From Elsewhere (I saw half of the episode before taking the Flutazolam and now I\u2019m watching the first half of the episode. Side note, this show would be interesting to watch on psychedelics, dissociatives, possibly even anticholinergic deliriants like Trihexyphenidyl, and Zolpedim/Ambien because of how trippy the plot is.) and about to eat some leftover pancakes because i'm hungry. The effects are still going strong and i'm starting to get tired and i'm debating on whether or not to try and get some sleep to see how effective of a sleep aid Coreminal is because so far I've stayed awake during my other trials with it, decisions... decisions... \ud83e\udd14\n\n12:45 AM: Well after eating i'm over the 2 hour mark since I took the Flutazolam so the effects are likely going to start dying down soon, still debating on whether or not to go to sleep or stay up and watch Criminal Minds. \ud83e\udd14\n\n1:40 AM: The effects have seemed to have diminished some, this benzo is said to have a 3.5 hour elimination half life so that could possibly explain why it doesn't last very long compared to other benzos. I'm feeling pretty tired and my muscles still feel fairly relaxed although my fibromyalgia is starting to flair up... -.-\n\n2:00 AM: Decide to go to sleep. It took a bit but not terribly long to fall asleep since I was laying on the pressure points in my back where my fibro pain was coming from.\n\n10:00 AM: I wake up feeling stiff and sore from my fibromyalgia flair up and start my morning meds of 150 milligrams of Pregabalin/Lyrica (I take 300 milligrams of Pregabalin a day for my fibromyalgia) and 8 milligrams of Suboxone (I also take 16 milligrams of Suboxone a day). I also decide to smoke a couple bowls of Cannabis and take my final .25 milligram Clonazolam dose. However I feel no next day sedation or grogginess and I think it's safe to say the Flutazolam has worn off. \n\nI may try Flutazolam in a combination of other drugs like the Japanese Methaqualone analogue Afloqualone (Arofuto) which is used as a muscle relaxer in Japan and South Korea or perhaps with Baclofen or other potential fun sedatives. During one of my trials with Flutazolam I drank 5 mixed drinks/cocktails of E&amp;J Apple Brandy and apple juice (a fire mixed drink imo that I highly recommend for any of you who enjoy drinking), 12 milligrams of Flutazolam (Coreminal), and 1050 milligrams of Carisoprodol (Soma) and that was a pretty nice combination with intense muscle relaxation and was extremely anxiolytic and just a great combination all around imo.\n\nI personally think people who have no benzo tolerance or enjoy mild subtle benzos would definitely enjoy this one. Thanks for reading guys. I'm likely going to try and write more trip reports on some of the obscure RCs and foreign pharmaceuticals I have in my possession such as Clomethiazole, Chlorobutanol, Chloral Hydrate, Afloqualone, and Rilmazafone to name a few and combinations of other drugs (particularly Zolpidem/Ambien and Biperiden/Akineton) because it's something to do during this COVID-19 quarantine in the USA.\n\nEdit; I\u2019ve tried another combo with Flutazolam and that was 20 milligrams of Flutazolam and 500 milligrams of \nF-Phenibut both taken on an empty stomach and it was a decent combo with good anxiolytic effects although I feel like I were to lay down and try that combination could have potentially helped me fall asleep or take a nap. The combo lasted 4 to 5 hours definitely not a bad combo. I may have to wait for my benzo tolerance to drop as I\u2019ve been using a lot of 2 milligram Clonazepam tablets lately and try a combo of Flutazolam with its chlorinated analogue Baclofen. I\u2019ll update again when I try this combo.", "author": "pretty_boy_flizzy", "score": 27, "flair": null, "created": 1585124195.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/foghiq/flutazolam_coreminal_trip_report/", "num_comments": 43, "title": "Flutazolam (Coreminal) Trip Report", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"flfp29i": {"score": 4, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/foghiq/flutazolam_coreminal_trip_report/flfp29i/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1585141675.0, "body": "Nice report dude, funny how this pops up because for a while I had been feverishly searching for trip reports on flutazolam lmao.

Meaning it is hard to overdose on. The worst experience I had was an amazing supernod where I passed out and tried to start the same movie again. Then passed out again. Literally the only bad thing was missing the movie. It's probably because I mixed it with two benzos, Phenibut, and gabs. Otherwise things are great. Even that \"bad experience\" was warm and cozy. I also actually got a better nights sleep on it than I ever plan to. It has helped me cope with bipolar disorder and PTSD. I normally have at least two manic episodes a week (lasting a day) and correlated with fears of going to sleep and staying asleep. This knocks me out in only a way high dose benzos will do but without the hangover. Literally the morning after my double nod out I had the chillest experience ever at, to or through an airport.\n\nThe reason I took a high dose was because I decided not to travel with it and with tramadol instead because I didn't wanna pack a baggie and snorting scoop. I opted instead for the trams which looked very similar to my Olanzapine. It felt much dirtier and I sought out the strongest kratom extracts once I was in a legal state. It isn't that I don't have kratom at my disposal it's just that once you're at the ceiling there are bad gastrointestinal effects not true with 2map. Trams are the second treatment I've tried to be dual opiate agonists and work on seritonin.\n\n There have been trials on Tramadol and Tianeptine, and some have been successful and Tianeptine is an approved anti-depressant in several countries but never on a full scale opioid. Tramadol would probably never work in opioid doses for depression as it leads to a dirty mental fog. O-DSMT is the chem I have now and it's only slightly cleaner with a better duration.\n2map's major downfall is it's short duration. You have to redose after 3 or so hours. But the same is true with Tianeptine.\n\nThere are other benefits.\nOn 2 repeated doses of both of us taking 20mg each intranasally, NYE was a magical evening with a girl I only kinda knew. At least for that night I knew her much better and I probably owe it to this chem. \n\nAlso sex on this stuff and a small dose of amps (RC or otherwise) is great because the amps increase sensation and 2map allows you to last n last and women can have multiples during. (I believe this stuff is only a sexual enhancer for men and only when combined with amps. Women may get enhancement from this opioid as well but for them it's mostly the amps.\n\nThe 2 biggest problems with opioids are that they are fatal and how they are illegal. My first only somewhat careful experiences with this chem were very forgiving as I didn't skimp on the rest of my complex cocktail but it enhanced it in ways that were harmless. I had good conversations, was sub euphoric happy or completely euphoric with seemingly anyone and everyone. Even if I'd dosed a bit too much. So that makes this rather safe compared to other opioids. The other pesky part of opioids is the illegality of them.\n\n2-Methyl-AP-237 is federally uncontrolled and 5 state legal as it is only an analog of a Chinese cancer drug Buccinazine which is also uncontrolled.\n\nI dare say that if taken with restraint only 4 days a week that this drug should be considered an antidepressant nootropic. Much like Tianeptine. However Tianeptine WD is often worse than heroins and the WD from 2map is only as bad as morphine WD. Some food for thought is how Suboxone allows former addicts to live normal lives even while treated with subs. If 2map stays classed the way it is, people with complex mental disorders may lead more normal lives as well.\n\nNext up for hot take Monday: Etizolam when not abused is as effective as any benzo.\n\nAlso Clonazolam in low doses may combat both depression and anxiety\n\nEdit: Also no need to go onion farming. 2map, etiz gs and clam gs are incredibly easy to find clearnet!", "author": "StoopSign", "score": 8, "flair": null, "created": 1580780148.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/eyam5b/update_2methylap237_is_my_new_favorite_rc/", "num_comments": 36, "title": "Update: 2-Methyl-AP-237 is my new favorite RC", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fghd0b2": {"score": 5, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/eyam5b/update_2methylap237_is_my_new_favorite_rc/fghd0b2/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1580810898.0, "body": "Everyone says it\u2019s garbage, but I completely disagree.

It was their party that I went to but they really didn't wanna hear about how awesome IV dilaudid was or see me sell pills and put Clonazolam in each of my sodas because I refused to pay for drinks. The bartender new why the guy withdrew money from the atm because he wasn't quiet about it.

Were talking branded bath salts containing mephedrone, 2Cxs, BZP pills and herbal blends of JWH018. As these products were so much stronger and cheaper than street drugs there was a massive decline in the black market. To be fair drug gangs did get involved in the rc market (which was far from clean) and id say contributed funding to the anti legal high hysteria. I remember arriving into my city early for work one morning towards the end of the pre ban era to find smoke hanging for miles. A drug gang had bombed a very succesful head shop to put them out of business. Alot of money was found in that fire proof safe ill tell ya. The shops did such good business there was some 24/7 ones that would serve through a hatch. Chinese delivery drivers were known to pick up shit late at night and bring it with your food for a nice tip.\n\nAlthough later during this period I got heavy into mephedrone (hadnt taked mdma or cocaine at this stage so you can imagine how much more the already legendary euphoria was amped up and im not sure if ill ever get near the level of psychosis aswel from meph binges) my main focus was spice. gold, silver, diamond, yucutan fire etc. These blends were interesting to experiment with albiet a lot more tricky/messy/addictive than cannabis. Some would cause hallucinogenic and delusional states. I can remember walking across a field listening to the chatter of trees in the wind. Stopping to watch as they talked to one another with increasing understanding of what they were saying to the point id become one myself. No longer watching from my body but looking out from up high  at the little figure of myself.\n\nI remember a shop opening in a very upper class area and that was the breaking point. It didnt last more than a month after that. Mothers in arms on all the late morning talk shows speaking about the evils of these substances and the benefits of prohibition. There was a really weird patch after the ban where street drugs hadnt come back properly yet and the shops didnt have to close straight away. They got rid of some weird shitty products that somehow werent covered in the band. Ill never forget the intense projectile vomiting and no other effect some post ban headshop pills i got gave me. This brings us up to the year 2010.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn 2012 I went camping in the UK with some scottish friends. It was a lovely site. Yurts and tents set up in a clearing surrounded by dense magical forest. No civilisation for miles. One of the first days we went into town and picked up a bag of herbal insence from the head shop. We took a small puff each from a pipe and went to see Prometheus in 3d in the cinema which was dope. Later at camp we discovered just how heavy this particular noid was. Very delerius and trippy. The next day me and a friend went of exploring in the woods with the spice and a pipe. We got really fucked up I cant recall what happened but we lost the bag and pipe. Returned to camp ready to be punished by the rest of the gang.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few days later later I set off into the forest alone to clear my head after getting myself worked up in my head over some shit in my life. It was a perfect summers day and the sun shone through any gaps in the tall trees that it could. I came to a small clearing with a pond and a fallen tree. The fire pit in front of it added to the look of this perfect accidental bench. I sat down. At some point I noticed our pipe was on the ground with a very large barely smoked bowl of spice in it. I did what anyone would have done at that moment. I took the call. My jet lighter made short work of the packed bowl and i coughed my lungs up.\n\nI got very high very quick. Uncomfortably high. Crazy. I could hear the sound of summer and kids playing nearby. I stumbled in the direction of the sound. I realised through a small area of forest parallel to the clearing was the back of a cul de sac. This freaked me out i wasnt prepared to deal with people. It was shocking how close this housing estate was. walking around its parimeter a little and gaining some elevation i notice how large and pristine the estate is. Like edward scissorhands. I made contact with an entity named Jacob. Not sure exactly when he arrives but its soon after discovering the houses. He makes me aware of the forest 'motorways and highways'. We go to the edge of one. A cleared straight path with hundreds of blurry figures 'power walking' at high speeds going either way on either side. At the time nothing seemed out of the ordinary.\n\nI believe a few other things 'happened' between the highways and when shit got terrifying. I recall stripping and running across a field with jacob haha and i remember falling into the pond (this happened for sure). But everything started to get really awful when i noticed the distant angry screaming of my parents. I felt so ashamed. They knew i was high. They were worried sick and had in my mind at the time brought me on a nice family holiday. I had screwed it all up. Ruined it. I guiltily started to make my way back and there shouting got louder. Jacob left me to deal with this shit on my own. Very near the camp but still hidden in the woods i became super stressed about facing them. I kinda froze for a while.\n\nI started to sober up a little and certain facts started to come back to me. Mainly that my parents where in another country and most of what i had just experienced was total hallucination. There was nothing but forest out there but id seen a whole suburban world. I could still hear the screaming but i now knew it was my friends looking for me as id lost track of time. I navigated my way towards the voices and when i caught the first glimpse of tents I was like Andy Dufresne at the end of shawshank. Victory pose. My redemption. I legged it over to them feeling like it had been forever and with the look of someone who had just survived death. Well of course nobody had been screaming. Nobody was worried. It had been max an hour since i left. I just looked like a gobshite and they tore me to shreds in their adorable accents.\n\nOne of my friends was going on about these UK blends containing salvinorum analogs. I dunno about any of that. I have many crazier and dodgier tales but i always come back to that housing estate in my mind and my imaginery friend Jacob. So many of my noids (and hallucinogens in general) trips were with friends in various types of wooded areas so so many of my psychedelic reference points are tree related.", "author": "199me", "score": 30, "flair": null, "created": 1578221034.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/ek6tnm/into_the_woods/", "num_comments": 31, "title": "into the woods", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fd6m6w1": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ek6tnm/into_the_woods/fd6m6w1/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1578221813.0, "body": "And if you don\u2019t mind, what are you using right now?", "replies": {"fd6mc0a": {"score": 6, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ek6tnm/into_the_woods/fd6mc0a/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1578221864.0, "body": "cannabis atm", "replies": {"fd6mf8f": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ek6tnm/into_the_woods/fd6mf8f/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1578221895.0, "body": "Only weed?", "replies": {"fd6mkw4": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ek6tnm/into_the_woods/fd6mkw4/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1578221947.0, "body": "yeah i was on binge recently of a pcyp and then a php but im taking a week or two off anything but weed", "replies": {"fd7ercy": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ek6tnm/into_the_woods/fd7ercy/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1578232134.0, "body": "Pcyp better than pihp?", "replies": {}}, "fd7n7rs": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ek6tnm/into_the_woods/fd7n7rs/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1578235872.0, "body": "How is A-PCYP compared to a-php/pvp, hexen, NEP, etc?

I was also alone during my dosing.\n\nDay one was 20mg + 20 mg an hour later.\n\nDay two was 60 mg + 20 mg + 30 mg + 50 mg all spaced out about 1.5-2 hours.\n\nDay three was 50 mg + 40 mg an hour later.\n\nConclusions:\n\n\\- Although I didn't take any \"heroic\" doses, my subjective experience leads me to assume doses >180mg are probably pretty pointless.\n\n\\- I swear dissolved I could start feeling it kick in within 10 min (maybe there's some sublingual shit happening idk)\n\n\\- There be lots of accelerated heart-rate, palpitations, jaw clenching (not gurning), pupil dilation. I think >75 mg it's very obvious you're on a drug.\n\n\\- The come-up was 60% sedating, 40% amped; the amping happened more towards the beginning of the come up, whereas the sedation dominated towards the middle/end; sedation was similar to come-up sedation on molly, the amped-ness was interspersed and quite obvious, I was just very excited/hyped/ready to jump and dance.\n\n\\- I suspect you could be functional at low, low doses (like sub 20mg) but I also suspect you REALLY wouldn't want to. I only got motivation to have fun, not work. I also suspect it could be good for social situations and/or parties (at like 20-40 mg). I also suspect it would be quite good for a concert (basically a full-on roll) or with a partner (for empathogenic purposes) at like 40-120 mg.\n\n\\- This is a great compound to \"titrate\" your dose upward because you can dissolve it, sip on it, and onset is fairly quick, but you do actually feel it when you take more. You can experience both the come-up and peak effects at the same time when dosed accordingly. The powder itself tasted like intense chalk mixed with the world's shittiest lime-flavored Tums (idky, that's just how my brain sees it).\n\n\\- Music is the absolute bees knees. Bass hits your soul. Bangers make your head bang. Sounds have more depth and feel more pristine.\n\n\\- Vasoconstriction is a thing. Penis did not cooperate for a majority of the time I attempted to coax it on higher doses. Sub 30 mg should maybe be fine?\n\n\\- The peak was really nice. Everything had a positive characteristic to it. For example, I'm generally very sensitive to temperature/temp changes but the hot outside and the cold inside (which I could clearly differentiate) both felt nice, in their own way. Not as much tactile euphoria as molly (by tactile euphoria I mean like touching things and stretching and lying down). The physical euphoria came in waves, like warmth that radiated from my chest, face, and fingers. Not overly intense, but definitely there. Really was like a warm embrace from someone you love that loves you with an extra kick of \"woah.\" After a wave of euphoria usually came some cognitive euphoria -- a sense of contentedness and that everything was going to be okay.\n\n\\- Offset's last album wasn't satisfying, but the offset of the drug wasn't unpleasant. Generally just jaw clenching as the euphoric waves decrease in frequency and intensity.\n\n\\- No psychedelia at all. Things are brighter but that's pupil dilation for ya.\n\n\\- Being hydrated is important, being dehydrated makes it feel like your face is super warm and melting your body.\n\nOverall, this drug is fucking awesome. I tend to write like an autistic robot, so I might have undersold it, but it might be my favorite compound. It's an \"easier\" drug than molly and less exhausting. You can casually have a good, even very euphoric time w/o being geeked tf out. Bear in mind that I fucking love music and had a few three hour music-binge sessions during my experimentation. So far I haven't experienced a come-down but day three was pretty recent to be fair but also this compound is very serotonergic so I was expecting to be absolutely dead or zombified by now (I didn't take any supplements before or after, because I'm an idiot :)). I want this drug to have its own nickname like Benzo Fury or Hexen. I'd suggest one, but I'm an uncreative fuck. I want others to experience this one.\n\nEdit: food was kinda shitty tasting tbh, just eat an hourish before dosing so you actually have nutrients in your body\n\nLeave questions in the comments.", "author": "helium_ego", "score": 18, "flair": null, "created": 1596989841.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/i6fw45/a_review_of_3fea_potentially_my_favorite_compound/", "num_comments": 23, "title": "A review of 3-FEA, potentially my favorite compound", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"g0vow4j": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i6fw45/a_review_of_3fea_potentially_my_favorite_compound/g0vow4j/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1596997766.0, "body": "Do you know if this can be taken with an ssri?", "replies": {"g0vqx2m": {"score": 6, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i6fw45/a_review_of_3fea_potentially_my_favorite_compound/g0vqx2m/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1596999882.0, "body": "No, you should stop taking your SSRI\u2019s 7 days before ingesting and should steer clear for another 7 days after your last ingestion.\n\nEDIT: OP recommends a minimum of 31 to 45 days.

I went to a party and took around 400mg MDMA and about .4g of amphetamine over the course of 10 hours. We got back to the after party, where this guy decides to make MDMA tea (i can recommend this, however stick to low doses). I drank one glass, and started to feel REALLY rolly, which only lasted an hour and then i basically felt empty stimulation. Me, being the retard that i was, decided to chase the dragon, poured myself another cup and quickly drank it. After about 10 minutes, i felt an INSANELY OVERWHELMING sense of impending doom, my temperature skyrocketed (39.4 celcius at my worst) and i started trembling, hallucinating, i couldn\u2019t breathe and my head felt like it was imploding. I asked how much MDMA was in the can, and the guy dissolved 2.5g in about 10 cups worth, of which i had 2. That\u2019s 500mg\u2019s in about an hour. I ran upstairs, filled a bath with cold water, quickly undressed and got in the bath as i felt myself getting insanely warm (i still think this saved me, overheating causes death in most MDMA overdoses). \n\nI\u2019m not one to call ambulances fast when it comes to drugs, however i felt like it was needed. I called them, and they ended up coming relatively fast. I was able to tell them what happened and what i did/how much i took and they decided to give me valium, i can\u2019t remember how much. They actually didn\u2019t take me out of the bath because of the risk of over heating. Also got my temperature checked.\n\nI didn\u2019t have to take Cyproheptadine, because the valium in combination with active cooling helped alot.\n\nI got told i was extremely lucky as my temperature was nearing 40 degrees, and anything over 40 degrees is basically extremely life threatening.\n\nEDIT: After effects were horrible. Extremely depressed for the better part of 9 months and had brain zaps and sleep paralysis for months.

I searched around  primarily on Reddit, but also on YouTube, BlueLight, Drugs-Forum,  PsychonautWiki, and Erowid. Here is the summary of what I have found.\n\nFirst  off I want to say that it appears I was mistaken about the safety of  25E-NBOH. I had previously been under the impression that there had been  no deaths or hospitalizations from any of the NBOH series, but it  appears that there is one death in Brazil attributed to 25E-NBOH.  Interestingly, a lab in Brazil has also had difficulty differentiating  between 2C-I and 25I-NBOH. Another lab in an unspecified location  reported a sample was 2C-E, when in fact it was 25E-NBOH, and there has  also been a death from 2C-B in which a similar mistake is speculated to  have been made.\n\nConcerning  dosages, seven users have reported dosing between .8mg and 2mg maximum.  An addition five users have dosed as high as 3mg. Three users have  dosed between 3-4mg max, and there are a few outliers. One user reported  taking 7mg, another 6mg over a few hours, another took 18mg, one user  took 4.4mg with tolerance, and finally the guy who took 30mg orally.\n\nThis  substance seems to have a 4-8 hour duration, some users saying 4-6  hours, others reporting 6-8. There seems to be lasting stimulation. One  friend of mine reported being unable to fall asleep for 12 hours. Not  many users report much of a bodyload, though there are some people who  have experienced slight nausea and headache. The substance is generally  described as euphoric, not overly stimulating, and very visual.\n\nHere  are some links with my notes, I went through most every thread by did  not include a link to those I did not feel added much to the  conversation.\n\n  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDrugNerds/comments/ebn63x/can\\_forensic\\_make\\_a\\_mistake\\_about\\_25enboh\\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDrugNerds/comments/ebn63x/can_forensic_make_a_mistake_about_25enboh_analysis/) [u/sqqlut](https://www.reddit.com/u/sqqlut/):  forensic analysis lab made mistake and reported 25E-NBOH as 2C-E.

This report is of the first time ever using 2-FA. Cheers!\n\n---\nThis is the beginning of my 2-FA trip report. I will record anything of note as the high goes on. My focus will be on the difference between 2-FA and regular racemic amphetamines. As for the chem itself, the appearance is a completely white very fine powder that smells slightly of citrus. It tastes like normal amphetamines I've had before but with a hint of old oranges. Not the most pleasant taste but it's not so bad. \n\nFor note, I will be using 50mg salt nic juice in my vape throughout. This may alter the effects of the drug so take that into consideration if you choose to research this chem yourself.\n\n6:22 dosed 30mg orally, I mixed the powder into a third of a shot glass of water and drank it. Empty stomach except for liquids. When mixed with water it doesn't taste much like citrus as I was kind of expecting, instead it tastes just like normal amp when mixed with water. \nTotal ingested: 30mg\n\n6:45pm I'm beginning to feel it, a little buzz in the front of my brain.\n\n7:30pm it's completely kicked in now. I feel good, calm and collected. My mind is rather clear and thinking is easy. There is a buzz a few inches behind my eyes, but nothing major. My body feels lighter, easier to move. Wakefulness is increased but not significantly, I feel like I could probably go to bed if I wanted to but I don't. I feel focused. I'm playing mincecraft with my girlfriend and I feel motivated to build and to finish projects I gave up on in previous sessions. \n\nHonestly this feels exactly like I took an Adderall. \n\n7:45pm mixed another 25mg into water in the shot glass and drank it. For note, when I add the powder to the water most of it dissolves very quickly but there is a few specks left at the bottom each time. These specks are hard to the touch and I think it's just where the powder has rocked up naturally. They dissolve very slowly, so I am drinking the water then getting the specks with my finger and eating them. \nTotal ingested: 55mg\n\nI am loading up guild wars 2, as I expect this high will go very nicely with such a game. \n\n8:00pm guild wars 2 is updating, so I'm listening to music. Wow, this stuff is good for music appreciation. Loaded up my stims playlist, which is mostly edm, and the bass is making me very happy. I've taken about the equivalent of two Adderall and music sounds significantly better than it does on Adderall. I'm being drawn into the beats!\n\nSide note, if you like listening to music on stims I suggest listening to some music by S3RL. They are Happy Hardcore and their sound is perfect for stims imo. Smooth but heavy. Very nice. Here's one of my favorite songs by them: https://youtu.be/rCz3dK_F_Bc\n\n8:24pm my girlfriend's phone case is breaking, and she just gave me a piece of it to chew. Oh boy does chewing feel good. I prefer to chew with my front teeth on stims. Now, I don't feel like I *need* to chew, I'm not gurning or grinding as far as I can tell, but chewing feels great. She also suggested I listen to The Real World by Owl City, and it was a damn good suggestion. It sounds magical and the bass is perfect for this high.\n\n9:12pm starting to come down from the peak of the first dose, I have decided now is the time to test boofing. I have prepared 2ml of water and added 56mg of 2fa and stirred until dissolved. \nTotal ingested: 111mg\n\nThis stuff is definitely more caustic than normal amp, I can feel it burning a bit in my anus. It's not that bad, but I think it needs a bit more water. Next time I will use 3-4ml of water instead of 2. \n\n9:57pm well boofing is nice but not as intense as normal amp, could be an absorbtion difference or something. I feel very awake and energetic, but still quite calm. Just realized I haven't been monitoring my heart rate, but honestly going just based on how i feel it doesn't seem to be significantly raised. This is normal for me on amphetamines, my hr actually lowers by about 10bpm from my normal resting rate when I'm on amp.\n\n11:00pm more boofing. This time I'm taking it up a notch, 95mg. It definitely burns. Hopefully I'm not harming my butt. It only seems to burn for about 5-10 minutes, and doesn't seem sensitive after that. I used 3ml water this time.\n\n11:09pm okay I really feel this dose coming on, didn't have much of a rush the first time but this time there is. Must be dose dependant. \nTotal ingested: 206mg\n\nThe way I feel hasn't changed much, maybe this dose will change that.\n\n11:41pm I feel pretty damn great not gonna lie. Energized, a bit euphoric but not a lot, about the same amount as regular amphetamines. It's a bit different though, I feel more cuddly and warm in my core than usual. Possible seratonin action? Placebo? Not sure. \n\nI really wish I could snort this stuff... I said I wouldn't but I might try it. My snorting kit is missing but I can use a straw. I'll have to see. I don't want to hurt my nose you know.\n\n1:36am I have decided against snorting it, and thus have boofed once more. 100mg in 3ml of water. This time I stirred it and crushed the specks with the oral syringe I'm using to boof until it was completely dissolved. Boofing it doesn't seem to be causing any harm to my booty, once the initial burn is gone there's no sensitivity or other signs of damage. That being said doing it for days or weeks on end probably would hurt the lining of the badonkadonk.  I feel confident and self assured. Like I could complete projects I have and focus on anything necessary.\nTotal ingested: 306mg\n\nI think I will go into a bit more detail about the boofing experience. There is a rush but it's mild, at least with redoses. The whole time it feels really smooth and easy, a little smoother than regular amphetamines that I've had. Although it's likely that the amp I've had in the past was cut with active chemicals that made it a different experience. I've been taking higher and higher doses and I haven't had any kind of overstimulation or any negative side effects at all, unlike regular amp where if i dosed too frequently I would feel overstimulated and anxious. The main side effect of boofing this is the feeling that I need to take a shit every time, but I get that boofing any stimulant. I feel like I could easily go all night and have no problems. The question is, what is the comedown like? I'll have to see when I stop dosing.\n\n1:51am at this point I would like to make note that nicotine feels pretty damn good on this, but it always does on stims so that's not surprising. It feels especially good when I'm coming up on a dose. Any of you who use nicotine probably understand what I mean, and those of you who don't probably aren't interested in that aspect. So I shall refrain from going into detail.\n\n3:40am I just realized how good my body feels. The physical euphoria is really nice, I'm not sure how I didn't notice it before. However it does feel a lot like dextroamphetamine. A little different, in that I feel warmer than usual. Usually on amp I feel rather cold and while my hands and feet feel cold from vasoconstriction my insides feel warm and fuzzy. Idk I'm no scientist but it feels that at high doses there is some seratonin action. Not a whole lot, I'm not exactly rolling over here, but it's fuzzier than regular amp at high doses and much more calming than what I've had before. I'm so calm in fact that despite being significantly stimulated I feel like I can lay down and rest, if not sleep. I don't plan on going to sleep yet though as I am accompanying my girlfriend to work for a short time at 5 am. I will take one more dose of 100mg before I go. \n\n4:00am probably the last dose of this trip report is 116mg boofed in 3ml of water.\nTotal ingested: 422mg \n\n4:03am I already feel the rush this time. I think the first time I boofed it just wasn't a high enough dose to cause a rush. I'm beginning to feel a little sleepy, which is good cause I wanna sleep when my girlfriend and I get home if possible. The physical euphoria is so relaxing. It's like being wrapped in a warm blanket. Or maybe that's the blanket I'm wrapped in. Either way, quite relaxing and very nice. By the way it doesn't seem to be burning as bad this time. Maybe I'm getting used to it? \n\nI haven't mentioned this before but time is going pretty slowly, until it suddenly isn't and it's been like an hour. Not sure if it has to do with me focusing on stuff or not. I've been on 2-FA for almost 12 hours but it feels like shorter, and longer at the same time. \n\n4:25am I've noticed I'm having \"hangs\" where I'll be doing something and suddenly stop and zone out for a few minutes then snap back and continue like I hadn't stopped. This happens a bit on normal amp but it seems to be happening more often on this. Could be a coincidence, or it could be that the amp I've had before was impure (it 100% was) and the higher doses of pure chem is causing the hangs. \n \n---\nFootnotes\n\nIt ends there because I got busy and didn't write any more, but I continued to redose throughout the next day until about 6pm. So I dosed for a solid 24 hours. That night as I was coming down I celebrated my birthday and drank and smoked weed with friends, which made me not even notice the stim comedown so I don't really know what that is like. However in the past with regular amphetamines after a 24 hour session the comedown was pretty bad for me despite doing things like drinking and smoking. So the comedown might be a little easier on 2-fa, but it's definitely inconclusive. \n\nSnorting was not included in this report because I simply didn't try it at the time of writing. Everything I read said not to snort it, so I needed that warning. However now I have decided to try it once, and snorted 45mg. I can confirm that the other info saying not to snort. No bloody nose or anything, but it feels the same as oral to me except it kicked in about 10-15 minutes faster than oral. My nose and throat are now sensitive as well. \n\nThank you for reading!

The idea here was to start as early as possible so as to not fuck up our sleep more than we have to. I was hoping to sleep in until 10 or so, but...it didn't work out that way.\n\nI dropped at 7 and went back to sleep for a bit. I woke up about an hour later feeling QUITE awake - restless, kinda squirmy. Clearly the stimulant effects were hitting already and sleep time is definitely over.\n\nThe stimulant effects continue to build over the next few hours. Some small part of me was still feeling tired, but the DOC was insistent that I get up and go do...something. Not much psychedelic effects at all yet - maybe shadows looking a bit weird, but feeling like I had like 7 cups of coffee. Tweaking a bit, but still under control. A mixture of fun stimulated feelings and restless uncomfortable stimulated feelings.\n\nMany hours later - maybe 1:00PM I started noticing some more psychedelic visual effects. They were relatively minor though, much less than you might expect from a single tab of acid. There were some other more subtle psychedelic effects happening as well - elevated mood, more openness, better conversations with friends. Overall nice, but not the next-level insane visuals I was hoping for.\n\nThe day went on for...a lot longer. We went hiking, which felt good. Listened to music a lot (which was better than baseline, but less special than any other psychedelic I've tried). Hung out, etc. The peak never got more intense and the stimulant effects did not ever let up. I had a wonderful time hanging out with folks that I loved, but think I would have just had more fun on acid or moxy or 2cb-fly or... any number of other compounds.\n\nPeople headed home / went to bed around 1AM. At this point I was experiencing zero psychedelic effects but still UNREASONBLY AWAKE. I'm getting pretty weary of feeling pointlessly amped up and not enjoying the muscle tension that comes with it. Took a cocktail of benzos, muscle relaxants, and melatonin to try to wind down and go to sleep. This eventually worked, and I fell asleep at maybe 3:30AM.\n\nOh, and my friend that took the same dose? He felt NO EFFECTS WHATSOEVER!\n\n**Bottom line:**\n\nDOC is like taking a half a tab of acid and also drinking waaaay too much coffee.\n\nIf you want to tweak for like 20 hours, DOC might be the drug for you. If you're seeking interesting psychedelic experiences, totally not worth it.\n\nMy understanding is that the psychedelic effects get more interesting at higher doses, but I'm just not willing to pay the cost in unpleasant and possibly dangerous levels of stimulation to get there.", "author": "Acleveralias", "score": 4, "flair": null, "created": 1579513539.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/er614c/not_impressed_with_doc/", "num_comments": 15, "title": "Not impressed with DOC", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"ff1vo8e": {"score": 16, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/er614c/not_impressed_with_doc/ff1vo8e/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1579516017.0, "body": "GABAergics are really good at diminishing psychedelic effects of a lot of drugs, try it again without the phenibut", "replies": {"ff5ni0p": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/er614c/not_impressed_with_doc/ff5ni0p/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1579630589.0, "body": "Not phenibut, it makes it stronger (with LSD atleast).

You are more likely to have something less randomly sampled. You could end up with 2:1 ratio of immediate release beads to delayed release beads, and likewise (so the effect could be strong and instant, or delayed and strong layer) - point being, half of a 15mg adderall XR won\u2019t guarantee an equivalent dosage of a hypothetical \u201cadderall 7.5mg XR.\u201d It will be much less stable, especially on a daily basis, than that. Simply put, you won\u2019t have reassurance of consistent dosing. \n\nThis actually could mean you sometimes are taking ... 2.5mg instant release, and 5mg delayed release (totalling 7.5mg, half a 15XR capsule\u2019s contents), one day, and 5mg instant release with 2.5mg delayed release the next, respectively. It\u2019s entirely possible.\n\nIf It weren\u2019t logical to hypothesize that the delayed beads...\n\n (being greater resilient \u2014 but both types of beads still being entirely dependent on \u2014 gut pH, to a greater degree than instant release) \n\n...probably have a denser outer coating, then I would retract this assumption.\n\nBut when physics claims denser particles naturally fall to the bottom, you are likely pouring a \u201cless-than-random population/sample\u201d of the beads, unfortunately in a way that is not half and half \u201cinstant\u201d beads and \u201cdelayed beads,\u201d respectively.\n\nI would go instant release if you want greater control, consistency, and knowledge of what dose you are precisely taking. Half of any *instant release* tablet is a much better random sample of the active molecules within the binder material...\n\n(just now weighed for accuracy, my own adderall instant release, of which I stick at 10mg, only amount in 10 years I\u2019ve ever found effective without unpleasant side effects or desire to reside) \n\n...for instance, in a 20mg Teva/Barr generic (non-name brand) adderall instant release I\u2019m prescribed, weighs 246mg, and it contains 20mg of adderall (levo/dextro amphetamine) - and splitting the tablet will likely result in 10mg per side, given no density difference in...sides of a tablet, as opposed to two bead styles in a capsule, when split.\n\nbtw, this brand - current Teva - has a \u201cb\u201d on it, since they bought out Barr - of generic adderall instant release, along with sandoz, are **the only** trustworthy versions of the generic tablet adderall, that I guarantee will work consistently, and is actually as good as the brand name version. The rest are all shit. Horribly inconsistent, unless we are talking about the consistent of other addyIR takers who agree about this online. \n\nPersonally (I know this is a lot, but all useful so you don\u2019t find out the hard way for too much longer, that is, if you are...finding unusual side effects, compared to brand name, at least) when shire lost the patent on extended release, and generic manufacturers began to shell them out, I noticed I had no positive effect anymore, and only side effects. No nocebo (negative placebo) effect either, since my learning of the time period I took generic XR was post facto to noticing this sudden lack of effect, and abundance of side effects.\n\nI\u2019d try going instant release, personally. Sandoz or Barr brand. For quality and accurate dose, along with no bad binding agents, and less side effects \u2014 but most importantly - consistency of measure in your dose.\n\nAnd ironically, I\u2019m not even in the therapeutic window of efficacy for the 10mg I took this morning, if this logic flow helps to realize that there is no crash from this dose level for me, and I\u2019ve tried every adhd med, all the way up to the ridiculous \u201c100mg vyvanse per day\u201d point.

I had planned to get 3-FA next, but due to the scarcity of it, it was too expensive for just a gram or two. So I bought 3-FMA (along with some 2-FA and 3-FEA) I got it today and wanted to share my thoughts on it. \n\nMy tolerance is little to none, because I usually take 3-4 months off stims and start doing them for a very brief amount of time. I have a hate-love relationship with the fluoro-amps, usually intentions of staying productive and functional, lead to excessive bumps, little food and drink and a night filled with alcohol, masturbation, and porn to sleep.  (Something I actively try to avoid.) This usually happens when I get 2-FMA and 2-FA. I try to chase a high/euphoria that isn't even there to begin with and instead of euphoria, all it leads to is residual simulation,  more wear on my mind and body staying up till really late in regret. \n\nIn fact, I had to dispose of the 2-FA and 3-FEA, I just recently bought because it wasn't serving me at all and I knew it would just lead to abuse. I had originally purchased them to try and mimic the effects of 2-FMA with 4-FA. (The best stimulant combo/experience I've ever had)\n\nA fair warning though, insufflated this has to be one of the most painful stims I've snorted in a while. More than 4-FA, maybe even more than ethylphenidate for me. As soon as it goes up your nose, a tear flows down your cheek. \n\nEnter 3-FMA. It's a lot like 2-FMA, but with more of a stimulating headspace. Remember in call of duty zombies, where you can pack a punch a gun? Think of 2-FMA as 3-FMA like that. Where I would feel cold and robotic from 2-FMA, there's a slight warmth to 3-FMA. Instead of wanting to take a bunch of bumps over the course of hours like 2-FA, I'm okay with how much I took and satisfied by the stimulation it provides. \n\nThe rest of my day, I will stay productive. Instead of constantly tripping over what needs to be done while in a cold robotic headspace staring at my to-do list, I'm doing things with ease.  I'll probably do chores, clean my car, and study some occult/esoteric stuff later. \n\n3-FMA is pretty nice and it get's me a little bit horny too. Would probably be good for sex too, just don't expect a massive rush of euphoria, more of a anxiety/stress relieving euphoria \n\nBy the way, my favorite fluoro-amp is 4-FA. It's so versatile, relaxing while stimulating and euphoric in higher doses. In combination at a low dose with more of the dopaminergic amphetamines, it's one of my favorite drug experiences ever. If you get a chance to do some, take it. \n\nHope you guys are staying safe during these times. Sending positive vibes to all of you.\n\nEdit: Also, this one supposedly has a very long duration!

If there is a show in my area, you bet your ass I will be there, and you can always find me in the moshpit.\n\nBefore I got into RCs I would always go sober to these shows and still do more so more often than not. I would have 1 or 2 beers max, then enjoy the show till the end. In fact, my drug use very minimal in comparison to the amount of RCs I own.\n\nThe excitement, adrenaline, and pure unadulterated fun I am able to have at these gigs is something I have never been able to recreate with drugs, and I don't think it's possible to do. Fear of loosing this feeling is why I normally attend these things sober, I don't want the experience to be tainted by my drug use, or have such a nice and euphoric experience that would make being at gigs sober loose it's magic. (hope you guys understand what I am trying to say but can't find the right words right now.) \n\nA few months back, after working a few days in a row at my very exhausting job and not wanting to miss a show because of how tired I was, I dosed 15mg of 2-FMA about 2 hours prior. This brought me to baseline but overall I did not feel like I was under the influence of something, besides some stamina than usual. \n\nFast forward a few months and a couple of shows that I went to sober, one of my favorite bands came to play, I had been working a lot, so I decided to splurge a little. \n\n3 hours before the show, I dosed 4.5 grams of phenibut. I'm pretty tall and this dose works pretty mildly for me. I took it because I decided I wanted to make some new friends, and it usually helps for that. \n\n1 hour before the show I dosed 25mgs of 2-FMA biked to the show. Normally when I take 2-FMA and then bike I can feel my body working overdrive and I get around faster. The experience was similar, but I was able to maintain a steady breath the whole time, I guess because of the phenibut counteracting the stimulation. \n\nOnce I am at the show I am feeling excited! There was still some time before the show started so I went to the smoking room and had a cigarette. I then had a second cigarette, and before I knew it a third. Smoking of amphetamines is normally nice, but with the phenibut mixed in, damn was it good. \n\nI bought a beer (I wasnt planning to but at the moment it seemed like a great idea) then headed towards the stage. Satanic Surfers opened up, and the mosh took over. Before I knew it, they had played a whole hour, finished their set, and I was a hot mess sweating but still amped up for the main band. \n\nDuring the intermition I smoke a joint in the smoking room to try and chill out a bit. If the intermition was longer I would have stayed and smoked joints the whole time, they just tasted so damn good. Before heading back to the stage, my dumb ass got a rum and Coke; in retrospect, I should have gotten a glass of water or two or three. I chugged the rum coke right before the main act. \n\nLagwagon started! If you don't know them check them out. The music sounded great and the crowd was full of energy. Besides the regular moshing, I also did a lot of stage diving. I normally don't unless there is  a big crowd  to catch me, but because of the phenibut and extra energy from the 2-FMA, I simply didn't give a fuck. To everyone I hurt while doing this, sorry not sorry. Luckily I didn't get hurt myself doing this and had a blast. One of the best shows of my life later, I was soaked in sweat, starting to feel aches in my body, and overall was ready to move onto something else. \n\nGot my shit, bought some merch and headed outside the venue. It was 2 degrees outside but it felt amazing  to cool down in the fresh air without a jacket. Rolled a joint and starting talking with someone who was waiting outside that had also seen the show. Talked about the show and smoked the joint together. \n\nThis is when shit started to go south. I have a huge tolerance to weed, but this joint really got me high, which was great. The issue was once I stopped talking to people and came down a bit, I got incredibly nauseous. Figured this was because of having mixed alcohol with phenibut, but in retrospect the biggest contributing factor was dehydration. I walked to burgerking and bought the cheapest meal on offer they had, a fanta and a large water. While waiting for the food I felt like I was about to pass out, and probably looked like it too cause people kept staring. When I got my order I chugged the water and got some instant relief, but was still nauseous. Had a meal and digested for a bit before heading out. \n\nAs long as I kept walking or active, I would feel perfectly fine, but the moment I would chill the nausea would come back. I was meant to go to an after party, but the nausea was so bad I decided to head back home. Biking back was fine and even enjoyable but at the end I again felt very dehydrated. Drank water and had this awful nausea for a few more hours. Slept like a baby in the end. \n\nThe worst part was waking up the next day. I felt very hungover, maybe the worst hangover of my life. My whole body hurt and I genuinely felt like an old man. I expected a few bruises like I normally after a moshpit, but what I saw was insane. Both my sides, from the top of my ribs to halfway done my thighs were purple and covered in bruises, but they were not very painful. It has now been a week and I am feeling 100% but some bruises still remain. \n\nNow I don't think I physically bruised more than usual because of any of the the substances I took. I think it was because the combination of 2-FMA and Phenibut gave me so much courage and energy, that I must have gone way harder than normal in the body slamming department. I will have to be more aware of this if I ever repeat the combo to avoid injury. \n\nNow, if you are still reading, you must be as bored as I  am at work right now, so hope you enjoyed this kinda pointless story. I guess what can take away from this is that its important to be conscious of our typical limits, as to not overexert one's self when under the influence. \n\nI might try this combo again in the future but be sure to cut out all alcohol from the equation, and stay hydrated. It was also smoking that joint after the gig that compounded the negative effects, I think. Will go back to going sober to gigs for a while. \n\nSorry if this is convoluted or does not make much sense. Stay safe researchers! \n\nTLDR; went to a punk show, took 2-FMA and phenibut mainly, had a great time, then had horrible nausea, dehydration and broke my body for a week.

I always like to read about this stuff and it often is helpful because you can make assumptions on theoretical Benzos.\n\nSmall disclaimer, although I am interested in SAR and have begun to read quite a bit about it I am in no way an expert so please do not guess dosages based on my *assumptions* here. If you find anything to be incorrect please correct me. Remember that I am always only referencing the main Drug, not its metabolites - although some data probably is flawed in that regard because e.g. diazepams potency probably does not merely come from diazepam. This is as good of a grasp as I could get of it.\n\n[Base structure for reference](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Benzodiazepine_Structural_Formula_V1.svg)\n\n* Removing a methyl group on R1 where there has been one before = Prolongs Half-Life of the substance itself (metabolites not included) by a lot - apparently no changes in potency. For reference see Delorazepam and Diclazepam or Diazepam and Nordazepam\n* An added Ring-structure on R1/2 which creates a Triazolo-Benzodiazepine (usually changes -pam to -lam in the name) seems to add quite a bit of potency, the amount varies however. For reference see eg. Clonazepam and Clonazolam or Nordazepam/Alprazolam. However non Triazolo-Benzodiazepines seem to have a prolonged Half-Life in comparison.\n* Removement of a 3-Hydroxy group seems to increase potency roughly x2 and massively increase Half Life (up to 10x) for reference see Phenazepam and its 3ho version as well as lorazepam and delorazepam or Diazepam and Temazepam (keep in mind that diazepams half life comes from its metabolites here)\n* R2' (the phenyl ring usually protrayed lowest's R2) Fluorinated seems to highly increase sedation as well as Potency. For reference see Flu-/Alprazolam and Flu-/Bromazolam or Flu-/Nitrazepam\n* R2' (the phenyl ring usually protrayed lowest's R2) Chlorinated seems to also increase potency up to x10 and increase sedation / hypotic properties albeit not as severely as fluorination\n* R7 Because I dont have any Benzos without any R7 Substitutes (if that is a thing) I'll just compare to other ones.\n\n\\-&gt; Half life: Cl &gt; NO2 &gt; Br (from broma - nitra - norda - zepam, not sure if this really holds trueusually because Bromazolam / Alprazolam are pretty similar in duration\n\n\\-&gt; Potency: I do not have enough good references to make a statement here really.\n\n\\-&gt; From personal experience I have the feeling that while Br / Cl at R7 doesnt make up for much of a difference really, N2O seems to be more muscle relaxing but I merely have a few anecdotes for that. (Bromazolam / Alprazolam &amp; Nitrazepam / Nordazepam)\n\n* Also only a few references for this but changing the 5- Phenyl for a pyridine seems to highly increase selectivity for GABA A parts that are linked to anxiety and therefore also decreases hypnotic effects, also seems to increase potency by quite a bit\n\n- some of this stuff cannot be applied to thiendodiazepines just so you know.\n\n^(Also I had to post this twice because apparently you cant say \"relationship\" because of \"ship\" as in shipping ???)", "author": "G1nnnn", "score": 14, "flair": null, "created": 1585376704.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/fq7b2j/anecdotal_benzodiazepine_sar_derived_from/", "num_comments": 11, "title": "Anecdotal Benzodiazepine \"SAR\" derived from experience and re-reading", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"flpqwrt": {"score": 5, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/fq7b2j/anecdotal_benzodiazepine_sar_derived_from/flpqwrt/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1585395143.0, "body": ">For reference see Bromazepam and Bromazolam\n\nif you look at the structure of bromazepam you'll see that it's triazolo analogue is actually pyrazolam", "replies": {"flqb9uo": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/fq7b2j/anecdotal_benzodiazepine_sar_derived_from/flqb9uo/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1585415982.0, "body": "Yep you\u2018re right.

Comparable to caffeine powder. No noticeable numbing. \n\nT-0:05 I already feel sensations of alertness, nervousness. Decided to vape to pass time.\n\nT-0:10 Yep, it's on. It's a clean feeling. I feel more energized and aware. It's more mental than physical.\n\nT-0:30 This is very clean. The stimulation is comparable to amphetamine minus the manic/tweaking edge. Usually on amp I get very nervy and irritated. With this, i feel much more \"up\"\u00a0 but with better self-control. I thought about taking a re-dose but decided against it based off reports I've read and settled with this satisfied.  There is music appreciation but there's no added spiritual depth to it. Just feels better listening to music.\n\nT:-1:00 Very light on the heart! It feels easier on my heart than nicotine or caffeine. A desire to vape was present through-out and indulged but only slighty more than the norm. I don't think I'd be inclined to chain-smoking on this if I still did that. I've had less heart palpation sensations than I experience commonly throughout the day which was surprising.\u00a0 It does feel like there's higher blood pressure sensations. Its not as physically energizing like coke were I want to start running. It's definitely more of a stay-at-home stimulant for me. I definitely like talking to people more than normal and have conversation rather than just one-sided ranting. Very sociable and warmish emotions. A lot of commenting on Reddit\n\nT-2:00 starting to come down. I don't see this as being a productive stimulant for focus or study. Its definitely more for recreation.

Anxiety from come down is present. It's hard but definitely not as harsh as amp. \n\nT-3:00 It has leveled out again. It's actually kind of nice. The come down anxiety has been mellowed by this leveling and has since been more of a steady slide. There's a present residual gentle stimulation.

Will probably stop soon, I\u2019m just feeling very rolly and productive (side note: benzos and benzo comedowns give me mania, so that headspace paired with the 2-FDCK and ODSMT is making me feel very fast and productive, even though I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m just tweakin).\n  \nUp until this point, the report has been live. I lost the ability to type effectively around this point but managed to save a time log of my next dose.\n  \nT+ 2:45: 60mg 2-FDCK dosed intranasally. I was feeling very dissociated and fucked up at this point and very satisfied with my high. Last time I did this combo I overdid the 2-FDCK a tad bit and it turned into a full on hospital anesthesia simulation (last post), this time I wasn\u2019t as holed out and could still walk, but boy was it difficult. 2-FDCK and O-DSMT I have discovered pair with each other extremely well. It was like a euphoric magic was added to the peak of the 2-FDCK experience, and once that had subsided (T+ 4:15) the experience turned into an extended and powerful nod (O-DSMT potentiated) accompanied by a perfect body high (mainly due to the 2-FDCK). I went to sleep a few hours later and was pleased to not experience respiratory depression, at least not enough to make me think I\u2019m gonna stop breathing in my sleep.

I know mixing tramadol and ketamine seems like a dangerous idea, and it did feel like I did damage the first time (overdid the dosing), but this time I found a sweet spot. I think O-DSMT has a better safety profile than Tramadol as well, but I\u2019m speaking out the ass there. 2-FDCK is also less acutely acting than ketamine and I always use a milligram scale, whereas with ketamine it\u2019s common to just do bumps or lines (eyeballed), so all of that coupled with my previous experience on higher doses &amp;amp; ability to have self control had me not worrying about death.

It\u2019s more me recording my memory of a very pleasant night.\n\nPreface: This is a report from an experience I had back in January, don\u2019t worry this is not me tattling on myself about what would be extremely irresponsible behavior in the age of Coronavirus. I had meant to write a report on this but kept procrastinating until I just forgot to do it entirely. I rediscovered my notes from then however. I find this to be an excellent and functional combination for socializing at night (whenever that may be safe again).\n\nI am going to see my best friends play a basement show, they play Emo/Pop-Punk under the banner of \u201cTwin Beds\u201d. Afterwards I will be going to a Lunar New Year celebration with my partner in our city\u2019s Chinatown. I have been looking forward to this night- house shows were always a fun excuse to dress up nice and put on excessive makeup and be around my best friends and flirt with people. And here I am- dolled up, with my patched-up painted-up battlejacket, Gerogerigegege t-shirt, ready to feel cooler and more confident than I normally do. Of course, I can\u2019t do it alone\n\nT0:00- I measure out 12 mg of 3-MeO-PCP and snort it in a line before leaving to catch the bus. I have also measured out a dose of 40 mg of MXPr that I intend to dose later, as it has a shorter comeup.\n\nT0:05- Oh bummer, I missed the bus. I decide to bite the bullet and pay for a rideshare- the next bus may not get me there before my friends play.\n\nT0:10- On the ride over I start to feel the first notes of the 3-MeO-PCP as they usually present. A bit of numbness in my extremities, a slight sense of weightlessness and lightheaded dizziness. Though I am sitting still in a car, I can sense a loss of equilibrium. My heart rate begins to creep up.\n\nT0:30- My ride arrives. I awkwardly thank the driver and step out with a buoyant spring in my step. My limbs are at once heavy and light. I feel faint like I\u2019m viewing the world through a screen. I am bubbly, energized and confident. I spot one of my friends in the band outside the venue, pay my cover and go in. The house is absurdly crowded inside, it\u2019s difficult to walk through it. I navigate my way to the basement where there\u2019s a little more space, I find all my friends there and greet them with hugs and pleasantry. It feels like my head is rising and my limbs are drooping. I feel fantastic and can\u2019t help but smile and joke, yet I also I feel awkward and slightly inhibited, like I can\u2019t get my thoughts straight. The lights go out and another friend\u2019s band plays first, I hang towards the back in the dark, taking in the creeping swirling visuals that are beginning to form, dazzled by the little flecks of laser light that dance around the space. The basement grows steadily more crowded as they play, in the dark I feel more confident and self-assured, I want to talk to strangers and make new friends but it\u2019s too loud to hear anyone talk and that\u2019s okay.\n\nT0:55- The first set ends, my sweetest dearest friends are going on next. I decide now is the time to dose the MXPr. I am not sure how the college-aged ex-suburbanite DIY emo kids feel about some punked out freak snorting drugs in plain view so I opt to find some privacy. Friends I see in the full light compliment me on my makeup and outfit, it feels good, I feel vain but I don\u2019t feel guilty about it. Sometimes it\u2019s nice to feel nice about yourself. The bathroom is occupied. I opt to go out to the backyard, where I can smoke some weed too. My best friend\u2019s parents have arrived- they have known me since I was 6 years old but we haven\u2019t interacted in a while. They are fairly conservative. This is really funny to me. I sneak around to the back and take my dose. It is chalky and uncomfortable, but that quickly passes. I take a few hits from my one hitter to round things out.\n\nT1:10- I am back inside while my friends set up for their set. The drip is starting to crawl down my throat, acrid and unpleasant as usual. I am feeling bubbly and affable, floating around the room like the upper quarters of some restless spirit or a bee flitting from flower to flower. I make small talk and joke with people, whenever I say something it feels as though it\u2019s clattering off to some void but I don\u2019t care enough to follow up. I push my way to the front and do my best to avoid my friend\u2019s parents, I am not in a state to talk to parents right now. I\u2019m buzzing with energy and anticipation, the MXPr feels like a shot through my limbs that turned my bones to viscous liquid, crackling and glistening with colors like an oil slick. The lights shut off and as my eyes adjust, swirls and spirals play in the dark while the spots of decorative lights seethe and expand into the world around them like an inquisitive mold. I\u2019m dizzy and I feel like I am living fully.\n\nT1:30- There is a bit of chatter and small talk as they tune and check their instruments, flick on their amps- a sizeable crowd has shuffled in behind me, dimly lit faces all moving and talking and melting and contorting, at once flat alien visages, but at the same time full of vibrant expression, decidedly warm and human.  As they get ready to play and step up to the mic, the crowd\u2019s energy pauses for a moment. I feel like I have the tense energy flaring down my spine and radiating into my limbs, a flicker of turquoise flame. The snap breaks, they break out into the first song, I am dancing and moshing with so many of our friends, shouting along the lyrics. It is so lovely to be so carefree, tossed around, sweaty, and given in to the music, it also feels awkward to occupy this space with my body, to try and gauge and respond to the energy of the crowd- that system seems completely out of commission. I am content to just let my extremities seep and sag, glowing at the edges with luminous haze, I am so sweaty and breathless but the music continues, I know every word and shout them along, as if my being has expanded through my skin to encompass those around me and for the time being we are all one collective set of flickering synapses  basking in the unifying electrifying energy of the love my best friends have for making and playing music that they love to make. I am captivated, a blurred void figure in the dark, shifting around as the walls shift color. I love how visual this is. The combination has really brought our prismatic flares at the edges of everything, I feel like pieces of me are turning to light and rising to the sky, yet I am still all lucid, all in control, a bit uncoordinated. They know how to keep a crowd happy, they know what the people love, it is a brief moment of fiery sweaty and dense exaltation.\n\nT1:55- The lights come on, they turn off their amps, I step in to be the first to give them very sweaty hugs, they have to know how hype I\u2019m feeling. Hype is absolutely what I\u2019m feeling, it\u2019s the mania and confidence of the 3-MeO-PCP morphed into a cocky self-assuredness from the energizing sensory experience I just had. I feel awe at this sense of confidence. I am exactly who I need to be where I need to be. The MXPr charges the experience with the fluttery love of novelty, of some extra dissociative weight and flares of visuals in the dark. I socialize more I flirt with people as if they really want to keep correspondence with a manic dissociated gremlin who infodumps about the drugs they\u2019re on or whatever the hell this patch on my jacket means or whatever the band on my t shirt is. I am blurring through this, smiling, nodding, not taking in information but feeling good about talking to people anyway. It\u2019s hard to string together coherent sentences and articulate my thoughts out loud. I have to leave soon anyway. One of my best friends told me I looked like a wastelands raider and it was a huge compliment. I look at my phone to coordinate my next move, the letters rise and sink in the screen and the bright light has absolutely absorbed my focus, as though beams of light have shot forth like ropes to bind to my eyes. It\u2019s just me and the screen right now, no more world. I break out of its spell, bid adieu to all my sweet dear friends, I wish I could\u2019ve stayed the rest of the show or gone to their afterparty but I already had something else planned for this night.\n\nT2:20- It\u2019s very cold outside. I\u2019m at the subway station now after a brief walk through the tree lined streets at night. It felt like the world was closing in on me, that outside and inside didn\u2019t really matter anymore. But the 3-MeO-PCP gave me a spring to my step and I burned through the world like a flash of ball lightning. I am dolled up in makeup in my jacket alone in a subway station. I forgot about this part. Some strangers keep casting glances but they mostly leave me alone. I puff my one hitter on the platform and find love in the filthy ceilings, faint dizzying forms unwinding into its apices, of my body shifted askew bit by bit, bounced on the buoyancy of the energy radiating from the surfaces around me. The platform is cold and quiet and still, the only density in the air overtaken by a haze of luminosity of sterile subway platform lights. The ride is delightful as ever, curled up in a seat while people mingle or interact or mind their own business- I catch visuals still swirling on the mottled surfaces, meandering patterns in faint relief. The sounds of the subway as it roars through the tunnels turns my being to gentle warm twisted metal when I close my eyes, my airy dissociative body at the mercy of the currents around me still. I get off at city hall and step into the gaze of the towering night skyscrapers, winking with flecks of light. The ambient light all around flares up with color, shifts off its source and dances and refracts, I am cold and bundled and every step feels as though a luminous gust is carrying me along ever so gently. I am absolutely manic, I want to stop and talk to the first street resident who seems like they might want to make conversation. This doesn\u2019t happen thankfully and I shuffle into the darker more residential tangle of streets. The prismatic light play of before has passed to still swirls and textures breathing in the darkness, their apices blessed by a St. Elmo\u2019s fire. Where at once I felt like I was skipping through gardens of crystalline light and cold concrete and the weight of the winter sky, now I was simply a hooded dirty figure slithering through the emptying streets, cloaked in the shadows and content to be ignored. My partner was at their parent\u2019s house for the night so I go to pick them up there. It\u2019s late, I am still a bit unsteady on my feet and still can\u2019t fully articulate sentences. I feel like I am indoors, contained within my clothes, I feel like I must focus my energy on maintaining this sensory field of pulsing colors around me- I am in no state to stop in for tea or anything. I slink off around the corner and wait for them to come out and meet me.\n\nT2:50- It is not but 2 minutes in that they ask me if I am on dissociatives, to which I reply affirmatively. They know me well. I suppose my awkward gait and disjointed speech gave it away. We first head back to my house to drop off our bags, it\u2019s a lovely walk full of dark shadows and immensely bright lights, a constant battle between the two for who can exert their breath on the concrete and steel around them. As we walk I can feel the experience receding more and more, and I find conversation flowing smoothly and more naturally. The night is far from over however, and I want to be in the right state for what\u2019s to come.\n\nT3:10- We reach my house, hug and kiss just a little, recharge and have snacks and warm up for a second. I decide to take 2 gravity bong hits in succession to get me back to the proper sensory place for this experience. Midnight approaches and we must reach our next destination. The weed stirs the dust a bit and I set back out in the cold night, taciturn with a vortex of colors swirling about my head. Outside still feels a bit inside and there is still a spring in my step. It is a short walk from my house to Chinatown, we can hear the sound of fireworks and firecrackers and drums as we approach, a large crowd is visible in the distance.\n\nT3:30- The entire street is awash in jubilant drunken throngs dancing and reveling in explosions. The residents of Chinatown are poured out onto the streets, joined by masses of what look like college students looking to party. People everywhere are on their balconies or leaning out of their windows, cheering the crowd on or setting off firecrackers. Lion dancers representing various local martial arts schools and their accompanying retinue of students and drum companies occupy the middle of the street, dancing in a frenzy under a constant shroud of small explosions. Everyone is joyous, everything is chaos, I am immediately taken into a sensory daze, the world swirling and spinning around me, its currents picking up the flares of energy that saturate this place like lightning bathing in a whirlpool.\n\nI absolutely love loud noises and acute stimuli. I love sounds that I can feel in my bones, blast waves that rattle their gelatinous trabeculae and vibrate through my softer flesh. I can feel it in my jaw, I can feel it as pulses of tightness around the crown of my skull. The toothy smiles of the people around me rise as standards into the air, joined by the standards of incense smoke and the great standards of every light around me projecting up into the tessellated night. My face is locked in a grin, all I can do is drift and smile. The sky above is so cold, the January breeze spirals off the rooftops, capping the hermetic glow of the windows and apartments below them, red and gold decorations on their awnings, and yet below that swirls of people bathed in smoke and ringed in pillars of sharp noise, the most thunderous and cacophonous of them being an epicenter which we all swirl around, a base chaos of the cold blue asphalt, the bodies in their yellow clothes marching in unison, creeping ever upwards towards sensory excitation like a plant yearning for a thousand suns, the  single heaving breath of light slicing the night into the sky, we are a single mass of fire and revelry, detonation and destruction and the embers that still glow, glittering under the cold violet night, a great length of something strung from our spirits and pockmarked with pops of black powder wrapped in red paper.\n\nI\u2019m in a dizzying awe, I wander the streets aimlessly with my partner in tow, the police failed to block the streets so a number of cars are just trapped in the crowd that creeps through like a lava flow, fire adorning its leading edge. There is a huge box of fireworks for anyone to pick from, I kick myself for not bringing a lighter or some more weed to smoke. All I can do is watch all the older drunken men who live and work in the neighborhood take pleasure in making a great big fiery mess in the busiest intersection in Chinatown. The firecracker strips shake my bones, I am constantly climbing things to get a better view and remarkably, I find that my balance isn\u2019t too impeded. The drugs are wearing off, I wish I had timed things so I would be peaking in the midst of this experience. I still feel like my extremities are glowing with a dim light like a dying lightbulb and I still feel a lightness and a spring in my step. I wish I knew this was happening every year so I could immerse myself in it, but I\u2019m glad I discovered it for now. (With the eventual burden of the COVID-19 pandemic though, I am doubtful an experience like this would be had for years).\n\nT4:40- It\u2019s very very cold outside, given that it is late January. My partner (who doesn\u2019t enjoy loud noises as much as me) offers that we go home. I agree, I am underdressed for this weather. We walk home, I\u2019m quiet and am ruminating on the lovely experience I just had.\n\nT4:55- We hang out at home for a bit, they go to bed before I do as I am still feeling to stimulated to sleep.\n\nT7:30- It\u2019s very late now. I manage to get myself to sleep.\n\nConclusion: This is an absolutely lovely combo that I revisited a number of times after this experience. It\u2019s not particularly valuable for one of those experiences where I\u2019m just in my room doing nothing, however it really shines to enhance various settings, particularly at night. 3-MeO-PCP on its own is highly sociable, comparable to alcohol but with stimulation and visuals and psychedelia. It however is lacking in the physical dissociation that can be fun at parties and social settings or that which just makes moving and dancing around more interesting. MXPr on its own is fairly shallow and boring with a drawn out and unpleasantly incapacitating comedown, but it has nice visuals and pleasant physical dissociation. They fill in each other\u2019s gaps perfectly- the MXPr mixes an ideal amount of physical dissociation into the 3-MeO-PCP, complimenting the 3-MeO-PCP\u2019s headspace perfectly, so long as doses are properly matched. MXPr also flares up the visuals, making them brighter and more apparent. The long lasting mania and stimulation of the 3-MeO-PCP meanwhile overwhelms the blank and still comedown of MXPr. It\u2019s a match made in heaven, great for adding some color and motion to a night out. Of course, as of this writing, social settings and nighttime parties are not something we should be worrying about.", "author": "Nervewing", "score": 15, "flair": null, "created": 1598507392.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/ih8abn/report_3meopcp_mxpr/", "num_comments": 1, "title": "Report: 3-MeO-PCP + MXPr", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"g2yxr59": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ih8abn/report_3meopcp_mxpr/g2yxr59/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1598516346.0, "body": "This was beautifully written, well done!
