With RCs, I historically have stuck to psychedelics and dissociatives, but I continued to take pills and do other more traditional drugs. At one point I noticed some problematic behavior and cut down on my usage of addictive substances completely but about a year ago I began dipping my toes in again cautiously with pretty strict limits. Mainly, I don't take the same addictive substance/substance category more than once every two weeks, i.e., I don't take opioids more than twice a month. Anyways, I decided, somewhat recently, to give some more risky RCs a shot and here has been my experience with them, and some other compounds thus far. This will also include some non-RC substances as well.\n\n\nNote: I have no tolerance to any of these substances.\n\n\n**2-FMA:** Not much new to be said about this substance, this was actually an exception to my habit of sticking to RC psychs and dissos. I occasionally use it to study, it doesn't give much motivation to do things you don't want to do, but if you're self-motivated it can be great for staying focused. Like other stims, it doesn't make you superhuman, and you won't get through a week of work in one day, but it's nice for what it does. I wrote the draft for this post on a comedown from a 2-FMA experience. I notice the increase in focus generally goes away in 6-8 hours with oral dosing and the stimulation lingers for 6-10, although I've been able to sleep after 6 with little problem. Insufflation is much shorter and the focus lasts 3-4 hours for me while the stimulation lingers for 6. I generally take 25mg orally, then take 10mg insufflated towards the 6-8 hour mark. I have no noted euphoria, but I do occasionally feel irritable which is obviously not enjoyable. Your experience may vary though as I suspect I may have ADHD, I also am not very experienced with stims so I cannot draw many comparisons.\n\n\n**2-methyl-AP-237:** This stuff is weird. To me, the high is very similar to oxy but with a much faster onset and come-up. I'd say my absolute best oxy peak experiences were similar to the average peak experience I have with this compound. The dosage curve is odd, orally, 15mg gives me the same effect as 15mg of oxy, 20mg is much more intense, and 25mg had me nodding and on the comedown, throwing up. I suspect I'm especially sensitive to this compound. This stuff is extremely euphoric, but as others have stated, short lasting. I'd say orally I still feel some effects for 3 hours after taking it, but the first hour after the onset is the most intense and euphoric. This stuff is beyond caustic as others have noted. I use gel-caps due to this causticity, and have noted some stomach discomfort, although my stomach is naturally sensitive. I have the batch that smells like cheese and it appears to be dry. In solution, the smell is intense, and it also takes some convincing in order to get it to dissolve, but it is soluble. When allergy testing and titrating using a volumetric solution of 5mg/ml in water, the solution burnt my tongue. Due to the short duration, I tend to orally redose twice after 2-3 hours. I have also tried insufflation. When insufflated, this stuff burns stronger than anything I have had experience with. It isn't unbearable, and the result is a rush more intense than oral usage, but I personally can't see how it's worth it, even if the potency is slightly higher and the rush is slightly better. It also lasts shorter with this route, more like an hour total. The day following insufflation of even a small amount (10-15mg,) is plagued with nasal discomfort. Overall, I'd just recommend oral. This stuff frankly feels disgusting despite the euphoria, and I personally cannot imagine using this daily. I haven't tried O-DSMT, but based off of what I've read, it seems preferable despite having a lower potency and potential to be euphoric. When taking this I struggle to convince myself to swallow the caps, as frankly my brain just views the compound as gross.\n\nOne last thing I remembered after writing I wanted to add but couldn't figure out where to add it in the last paragraph: This is the first substance to ever make me nod, higher (for people with no tolerance) doses of oxy and hydro never got me to that point. It was an interesting experience, but personally I didn't enjoy it just due to the nausea I was also experiencing. I did reach a trippy dream-like state though in which I saw stories play out, I can't remember them or describe them but they felt like they lasted hours despite only being minutes. I would suggest being careful with this one, I've seen people give terrible estimates for what a strong dose is based off their own personal experience. Particularly in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/f89mg4/psychonautwiki_2methylap237/), with any substance you should always titrate up, but realistically people tend not to do this unless it's a high risk substance, and being an opioid, this is a high risk substance. **Don't take 20mg because I said that's a good dose for me, and definitely don't take 50mg because the top comment of that thread says it's a medium-high dose for someone with no tolerance. I think if I took 50mg I'd be fine physically, but it would likely be extremely miserable and I do think there'd be some risk of vomit aspiration.**\n\nOn a more \"researchy\" note, I tried reacting it with citric acid and baking soda but neither underwent visible changes. I tested the pH with an uncalibrated pH meter, the result was a 5.4. I plan to retest this and other compounds with a calibrated pH meter and with listed concentrations when I have the time. I also hope to reagent test it and post the results although this may be more difficult as it would involve posting photos.\n\n\n\n\n**6-APB:** I find I am never accustomed to empathogens, I give 3 month breaks and they usually go longer than that and as a result, I feel like I go in blind even if it's a substance I've tried before. This was my first time with 6-APB, and it was beautiful. I was in quarantine, but I was able to call some friends, mend some lost relationships, and to open up about some of my emotional troubles. I felt love for all of humanity as is expected, and overall it was one of the most beautiful and positive experiences I've had in my entire life. I found it less stimulating than MDMA, less euphoric as well but I found that added to the emotional value of the experience as I wasn't purely focused on how good it felt. The body high was alright, nothing insane. I decided and followed through with some changes to my personal life and have continued to talk with some friends who I reconnected with. As for dosing, I took 125mg initially but roughly 10 minutes later I decided to add an extra 25mg as I was not too concerned about having a strong experience. My batch was succinate and I cannot speak to it's purity.\n\n\n\n**AL-LAD:** This is my favorite substance, I haven't had it in years and spent what was ~~probably~~ definitely an excessive amount to get it. I know it's rumored to be returning so I'll hopefully get more then. I took 300ug which I know to be a safe dose for myself, but I'd obviously suggest anyone else start with 150ug to be cautious. It was just as I remembered it, little anxiety, heavy visuals, etc. I actually even ended up watching the news on the comedown as the coronavirus situation began to be taken more seriously by the general public. I had an amazing experience and I don't see any other substance taking its place as my favorite. It provides introspection without a push and has had a large positive effect on my life.\n\n\n**Etizolam:** Feels like any benzo I've tried, I never really get anything out of them. I blacked out a couple times due to compulsive redosing but I don't really do anything irresponsible when blacked out. Delusions of sobriety exist, but I know for a fact I'm objectively not sober throughout and just don't *feel* anything. I cannot give logic behind my redosing but I tend to be at least a little careful about it, I find 6mg is my limit. I also find that I usually just fall asleep eventually. I'm not a fan of benzos/thienzos, but they're good to keep around and my main motivation for using them is to smoke a lot of weed without getting anxiety. I have anxiety sober, but to me the loss of anxiety benzos/thienzos bring isn't euphoric or anything, it's just a nice break. Maybe in a social setting this would be more enjoyable, but I have my qualms about using addictive drugs to treat emotional pain and social anxiety as I personally believe that can easily lead to severe dependency. I may try this as an alcohol replacement or take it in low doses and very rarely for social situations, but it's another one I can't see myself doing frequently, especially given the risks that come with physical addiction to these kinds of drugs.\n\n\n**Kanna:** Not an RC but I think it's worth commenting on as it's new to me. I have the MT55 extract and I've tried it twice, once at 50mg insufflated and the other at 50mg smoked. When insufflated it gave a short rush and mood boost and did feel similar to an empathogen, but much much more mild. I noted increased empathy as expected, but overall it was more of a novelty than a full experience. As stated earlier, I don't believe in using drugs to numb emotional pain, but given the low addictive and harm potential of this substance and how I view it as somewhat pointless for recreation, I may just use this occasionally as a little mood boost. Insufflating is unpleasant but not as bad as I was expecting and it does not burn at all. I can't comment much about the smoking RoA as it was mixed with weed and weed tends to give me anxiety if I smoke too much, and well, I smoked too much. The weed definitely overpowered it and I was more focused on keeping myself calm than I was on the effects of the kanna.\n\n\n**Continued in comments**", "author": "alladthrowaway033", "score": 24, "flair": null, "created": 1586307757.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/fwo57h/last_months_of_research_summarized_2map_mxpr/", "num_comments": 15, "title": "Last months of research summarized (2MAP, MXPr, & other more common substances)", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fmpdq92": {"score": 10, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/fwo57h/last_months_of_research_summarized_2map_mxpr/fmpdq92/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1586307810.0, "body": "**MPT:** I can't really give a great report on this one, I've only tried it once and it was an introductory, low dose experience. I smoked 25mg out of an oil burner and not all of the material properly vaporized. I used a normal lighter but think this substance likely needs a torch, this may also be due to my oil burner being thicker than average but it was my first time using one so I can't compare it to any others. It definitely had an effect but it was pretty weak as expected given the dose and incomplete vaporization. From what I could tell, at the low dose it was at, it had a very light but still somewhat introspective headspace. I had open eye visuals and very mild closed eye visuals which is notable as I rarely get CEVs in general. Like I said though, pretty light dose and I look forward to increasing it eventually. \n\n\n\n\n\n**MXPr:** I initially wrote a long first impressions post around this substance, but now that I have 3 experiences under my belt and plans for a fourth next time I have free time available, I think I'll just summarize my findings here and write a longer post in the future when I feel more experienced. Prior to trying this I read through the entire bluelight thread, which was at the time 20 pages, and I also read every report I could find on reddit. Overall, it seemed people either really liked it or just found it disappointing. I tried it at 35mg, 45mg, and 65mg, my three main takeaways were as follows:\n\n1.) A lot of people report the duration of the desirable effects is too short while residual dissociation lingers for too long. I personally didn't find this to be the case, there was a very noticeable shift in effects at the 2 hour mark for me; however, the experience after that point seemed more akin to low dose dissociative experiences than it did to residual dissociation. I personally found it enjoyable, similar to taking a 30-50mg line of 2F-DCK.\n\n2.) A lot of people referred to the substance as cold, I am not very experienced with dissos, most of my experiences have been with 2F-DCK with a few experiences with regular K and DXM mixed in. That being said, I didn't find this to be much colder than those substances, but to be honest I can't say I'm 100% sure what the \"cold\" feeling is referring to. It did feel more \"clinical\" than other dissos I've tried, but it wasn't significant, and I personally enjoyed it.\n\n3.) I saw a few people saying this substance has a headspace that was more difficult to manage than other dissos. In my experience this was true, I found it harder to maintain my composure on this substance in comparison to other dissos. That being said, I did not have a bad experience nor did I feel like it would take a bad turn at any point. I'd say my experiences were simply more introspective and emotionally demanding than they are usually on other dissos, and they were also slightly more confusing.\n\nAs for dosing, I found that at 65mg oral, I was just below holing territory. I have not insufflated the compound as I heard it's somewhat caustic, and due to this I also plan on testing it's pH when I get the chance.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Phenibut:** Also not an RC, but I tried this twice at 1.5g. I found this one interesting as it wasn't like benzos where I feel nothing but a reduction in anxiety. I understand this works primarily on the GABA B receptor rather than the GABA A receptor, but the noticeability of the effects still caught me off guard. I can't fully describe the feeling but it was pleasant, warm, and somewhat similar to alcohol. I have the HCL form, which apparently can cause some stomach discomfort, and I've noticed that both times I took it I got nauseous. I'll probably go for a lower, more functional dose next time and hopefully I will have less stomach discomfort.\n\n\nApologies if my MXPr or MPT reports have any grammatical errors, I wrote them when I was tired as I forgot to include them initially.
