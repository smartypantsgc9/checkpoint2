{"f68sl8": {"text": "I don't agree with the war on  drugs. I don't agree with any law prohibiting people from consuming any substance provided it doesn't harm other people. I consider the fact that hundreds of special, unique, wonderful chemicals have been banned, essentially eliminating the experiences they have the potential to offer, to be a form of desecration. I've been following the RC scene since around 2008, but only from the side-lines. I remember when MDPV was new and literally sold over the counter in real businesses. I remember seeing reports about the fluorinated amphetamines but was never interested enough to buy some. I remember when people started talking about MXE but thought that it's just a bootleg ketamine. I could say the same about other lost gems like U-47700, furanyl fentanyl, 6-APB, etc.\n\nThe bans won't stop. What is available now will disappear. What do you think we need to really hold on to? My guess is that when 3-FPM is gone it will take on a legendary quality not even ascribed to 2-FMA, as the cleanest, most \"functional\" stimulant to have ever existed.\n\nEDIT: I've been receiving PMs from scammers claiming they sell MXE.

It has a longer duration and a longer come up. Lasts 6-8 hours. The roll is harder by weight, and the overall experience is more consistent. You take a while to peak, then gently come down over the course of a couple hours, whereas MDMA can hit you in the face 30 minutes in, have you rolling tits for 2 hours then start dropping off out of nowhere, hitting a waves for a bit after that. 5-MAPB is less in-your-face energetic, but imo it is more pleasurable than MDMA. Holy freaking shit it's great, and prefer it to MDMA. If you want the extra push you can just add caffeine to it. 5-MAPB doesn't have much of a comedown and the hangover isn't as bad as MDMA ime. I've taken it a couple days in a row and it worked just fine both times. You can also dose lower and still get positive effects. I've taken 30-50mg and still found myself feel much more social and energetic, where if I take less than 60mg of MDMA, I might feel a bit of stimulation and serotonin push, but the urge to socialize or dance isn't there and taking a lower dose feels wasteful. 5-MAPB lasts longer, doses lower, has more consistent effects, is more versatile in it's dose-range, and is less pushy than MDMA. I also don't have trouble getting to sleep after a roll on 5-MAPB, which I greatly appreciate in comparison to 6-APB. \n\naMT is incredible but also pretty finicky. It can last 12-16 hours orally. Some people get a strong experience off of 30mg and some don't feel anything. Some people run into trouble with doses above 80mg and some people are fine. You wanna dip your toes in slow and find what works for you. I used to take 10-30mg before going into work at a retail store. It would dilate my pupils but other than that I just felt a bit more social and energetic and had light visuals. aMT is pretty much the best parts of mushrooms and MDMA. The visuals are like a light dose of shrooms or 4-AcO-DMT, mixed with the light, technicolor rainbow you get on MDMA. The energy is very much like MDMA, I'd say more like MDMA than 5-MAPB because once you find the dose that gets you rolling, it can feel pretty pushy, but I mean that in a good way since the mushroom aspect kind of balances it out. aMT has a 2 hour comeup orally, and this is usually accompanied by extreme stomach discomfort and sometimes nausea and vomiting. I have never puked on it, but I found myself laying down in the fetal position for an hour or so shivering because of the fluctuations in my sensitivity to temperature on more than one occasion. The visuals are beautiful and not overpowering at all. It's a perfect balance of a serotonergic roll mixed with a mild shroom trip. To bypass the nausea and shorten the duration, I highly recommend dosing rectally. I could use 35-60mg rectally and would usually be rolling pretty well within 20-30 minutes. Rectal administration also shortens the duration to about 8 hours and really cuts the bodyload down. It's very ideal for a rave or festival with this ROA and I find it easier to fall asleep and recover compared to dosing orally. \n\nI don't recommend insufflating 6-APB, 5-MAPB, or aMT. They all taste horrible, burn quite a bit and don't seem to work as well as other ROAs. All of them are more uncomfortable to snort than MDMA.\n\nApologies for the long response, but I hope this helps!", "replies": {"g4mhe6q": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ip4js0/most_enjoyable_rcs_in_your_opinion/g4mhe6q/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1599741341.0, "body": "The one thing i found to be most negative is the short duration of mdma.

I\u2019ve been clean from heroin/oxy for a while, and only taking Xanax or any benzo research chemical that I could get my hands on. \n\nI got 400 0.5mg Flubromazolam tablets and went to a McDonalds bathroom to pop them. In the past, I needed at least 20 of these tablets to feel high (my tolerance was absurd). However, I had very recently got out of rehab and had over 30 days clean, so this time I only popped 10 of the pills. \n\nI suppose it was too much. I don\u2019t remember if I took more after that, I just remember waking up in the ICU. They had a huge tube down my throat and a machine breathing for me, and I kept shitting the bed uncontrollably. I was absolutely fucked, I just couldn\u2019t believe it happened to me. I used to mix fentanyl and Xanax together all the time in high doses and never overdosed, but just 5mg of Flubromazolam was enough to make me collapse on the McDonald\u2019s floor and stop breathing. \n\nI used to think that severe respiratory depression only occurred when someone *mixed* benzos with opiates, as opposed to only taking the benzos. I was very wrong. This shit can kill you on its own, and it really doesn\u2019t take that much to do it.\n\nI was in the ICU for several days recovering from the overdose and they had me on suicide watch the whole time because they thought I was trying to kill myself taking all those pills. The cherry on top for all of this was the police finding an unmarked plastic bag with around 390 Flubromazolam tablets in my pocket. I was interviewed by the police briefly about the pills because they had no idea what they were, but luckily they didn\u2019t charge me with anything. I wondered if that was because Flubromazolam is technically legal, or because they saw that I was just a young addict and not a drug dealer.

Just that a while ago I tried some Flubromazolam. I thought I'd ordered flualprazolam which,IME, is just as manageable as clonazolam(although clonazolam is superior in all ways).\nCome nighttime, and I need to get some sleep. I realize then that the label doesn't say flualprazolam but Flubromazolam. I start googling to find any info on Flubromazolam, but theres surprisingly very little info on the dosage, not even at psychonaut wiki. \nI decide to \"toothpick it\". Take a toothpick/matchstick/whatever and got literally a speck on the tip of the toothpick which I dipped into a water bottle. I mean, it was barely visible to the naked eye. \n\nI'm taking sips of the water bottle. It started with a few sips and then a good gulp,leaving about half the bottle full. I guess this stuff has a longer comeup than more atypical benzos because after an hour it was *not kicking in at all*, so I drank the rest of the water bottle. \nI was sitting on the couch finishing off the water bottle, watching tv and that's all that I remember. The way it's like \"POOF! *memory blanked*\" seems actually kind of ridiculously comical now that ive reflected on it. What isnt a joke is losing 2 days. Friend told me I seemed drunk for the first few hours, then super tired and sleepy for an undetermined amount of time, then back to drunk until I passed out again. I have one memory that I hope isnt true,and instead was a vivid dream. It's actually a funny story but it would be a bit embarrassing to ask anyone if it really happened. \nAfter the second time I passed out is when i started to slightly come out of the blackout, into a brownout. \nThe brownout was also very hangover-y. It was like the feeling of a hangover and really terrible rebound anxiety while still being somewhat browned out. \nI think the only way to does this stuff is volumetrically. Pretty sure a non blackout dose would be under half a milligram at the most.\n\nI dont see much recreational value, and definitely no help for insomnia unless you dont mind being barred out for 2 days just to get 8 hours of sleep. I think if you have some kind of severe medical issue that requires benzos around the clock, it would be helpful, if you properly dose it volumetrically. Or if you're hopelessly addicted to benzos and just want to be dazed for days at a time. \n\nLastly, I believe in personally responsibility. It was my dumb idea to try to eyeball a microgram level dose. I'm not trying to blame someone else. It was a dumb idea, but it's up to everyone what they do with their own body and mind. It is, and should be your right to try flubromazolam if that's your peragotive.

If you wanted to use that to describe flubro in comparison to like diazepam other like I guess lorazepam those would be slightly more fitting examples, but it doesn\u2019t quite catch the essence of fentanyl regarding really any of it\u2019s actually identifying characteristics. Source to all this: I\u2019m a giant drug nerd and current chemistry studying in college, after I\u2019ve had lots of substance abuse in my past, including a 9 month physical opioid dependency that ended in 2017 with fentanyl hcl. \n\nFent is notably scary because of how it is cut into heroin, but IMO that\u2019s not the scariest part of the drug. It\u2019s scary because it\u2019s most appealing to the most desperate addicts, and it\u2019s just a perfect storm of addiction/\u201cfuck up my life\u201d potential. Using it to not wd just encourages more and more use. Unrelated to potency it\u2019s such a strong agonist that it takes 4x the naloxone per equipotent dose to reverse an OD. \n\nThese comparisons need to stop for information about why fent is TRULY dangerous is ever going to get around. **Fentanyl is not just an opioid that happens to be very potent. It\u2019s almost like this drug was specifically designed to ruin lives**. MIt\u2019s just a monster unlike any we\u2019ve had to deal with before. \n\nMeanwhile these benzos can get people in trouble that\u2019s definitely true, but other than the potency they\u2019re basically just like normal benzos. They also don\u2019t appeal to the same demographic of users, nor are they physically any more dangerous than others in their class whatsoever. Comparing them to fentanyl is like comparing a psychedelic microdose to methamphetamine abuse because they both have stimulating effects and long enough durations to get a normal user through the day on one dose. It would be laughable if the subject matter wasn\u2019t so terrifying. \n\nTL;DR: Clonazolam and flubromazolam are kinda just notably potent benzos. Fentanyl brings brand new factors into how it ruins lives while being the worst player for all the old factors too. It\u2019s terrifying and comparatively nothing like these benzos whatsoever, and saying they are can be detrimental to desperate opioid users\n\nEDIT: actually made this comment before reading your post, but it really proves my point.

Flat out wrong. I've abused/used Flubro and Flual and both are nasty, Flubro does take more care when dosing you are definitely correct there. However if you correlate the dosing the only difference really is that Flubro will black you our right away where Flual will make you feel like your fine when you're actually acting with the mental capacity of a 3 yr. old. \n\nFlualprazolam skyrockets your tolerance just as bad as Flubro, though your right 1mg of Flubro is brain dead where it's a dumbass moron on Flual though I don't see the plus or minus in either they both suck. If you correlate the dose the same they are both incredibly potent benzo's with a lot of negative side effects that increase exponentially in time. You could take Alprazolam for weeks and then be raising your tolerance. Flualprazolam you take for 3 days and it'll skyrocket to the same place as the weeks long Aprazolam dosing. \n\nI know this from first hand experience. When I began to take Flual I hadn't taken a benzo in over 10 months and I was thwacked in no time. It destroyed my life. Like I already said the part that is by far the most dangerous with Flual is that you *don't* blackout, you just think you're fine when your a complete fucking moron. Things like leaving the stove on or driving and crashing your car or falling over and crashing into something expensive; these things are very likely to happen on Flual almost more so than Flubro because you are active and think your fine. Flubro would zombie me into bed. I'm not even trying to compare they both are incredibly destructive and dangerous to take and I wouldn't recommend anyone do either really...\n\nYou experience way more intense \"delusions of sobriety\" on Flualprazolam than commonly prescribed benzos or even Flubro for that matter. Days later you're still in a stupefied state you just don't feel like you are. They are equal I guess is what I'm saying... Flual is in no way \"safer\" unless you are being specific to dose but that doesn't really make sense as every drug is different according to dose.\n\nI would recommend staying away from all 3 of these at all costs though like I said I've never taken Clonazolam. It destroys your tolerance so you're actually ruining the ability to even have fun or make it useful while creating a comedown/withdrawal that will be absolute agony and most likely lead to a seizure if abused for any decent length of time. I would even go so far as to say it's fiendish too, there is a definite euphoria to Flual that I didn't find so much with Flubro.

From 1948 to 1991, America was fighting the Cold War under the mandate of the Truman Doctrine, which itself was a direct result of the so called \"long telegram\" from George Kennan in 1946. This doctrine espoused the strategy of containment to stop the spread of Communism, where the US and its allies would pour money, resources, political aid and if necessary, military power into a region in order to ensure that Socialism/Communism did not spread to more countries.\n\nThis is where the terms First World, Second World and Third World come from. The \"first world\" was ostensibly the US and its Western Allies, the \"second world\" was the Eastern Bloc and its allies, and the \"third world\" was pretty much everyone else that the two sides fought over ideologically. The types of places that are a good place to foster a thriving drug trade (South East Asia, Central Asia, Central and South America) due to low employment, minimal infrastructure, government corruption and little law enforcement outside of major cities also happen to be the types of places that are ripe for revolutions.\n\nIf those revolutions happen to be Democratic and friendly to the West, or just far-right enough to be anti-Communist, then all is good and we prop up a friendly dictator, like in Chile, Argentina or Iran. If those revolutions happen to be Socialist or anti-West, well then, time to invade. If the place we invade also happens to be the major production region of a drug like coke or heroin, so be it. \n\nOf course there are numerous examples of the US actively supporting the drug trade because it was \"in Americas best interest\" (the irony is implied). Hell, while Nancy Reagan was telling kids to \"Just say no,\" her husband was basically using the CIA as a front to launder coke money to pay for weapons for the Contras to fight Communist revolutionaries. \n\nAfter the cold war, we still needed an enemy to justify our bloated military budget, so along comes the \"War of Terror\". Same script, all new countries to invade. Again, the fact that Afghanistan was the primary poppy supplier in the world when we invaded was inconsequential. For years the coalition forces vacillated between turning a blind eye to the drug trade in certain regions because it was literally the only thing bringing stability to most of the country, and burning entire fields of poppies to try to get the locals to cultivate crops less illegal.

It\u2019s shocking. A good kind \u2018Reddit pen pal\u2019 from the country elucidated the whole system in detail, and it is so...ethical, to be honest. Not to mention, so much less lives ruined, so much less tax money spent on prisons, so much harm reduction, so much communal exposure to help guide and reinforce truth of harm reduction education efforts. \n\nHonestly, check it out. If you want the details (down to the amounts everyone is allowed to carry on them for personal use, for each drug), feel free to ask me. \n\nIt is shocking, it is groundbreaking, it is ... worth adopting, everywhere, for the good of salvaging baseline even approach in humanity\u2019s \u201cpeace on drugs\u201d productive efforts, as opposed to the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d cycle that unjustifiably produces bans within a manner precisely accurate to what you describe, here.\n\nI feel you, bud. I don\u2019t like the stigma around drugs. \n\nThere are no bad drugs or good drugs, \n\nthere are no hard drugs or soft drugs.\n\nThere is, however, a paradigm we should all find relatably worth noting: *there are good* ***relationships*** *with drugs, and bad* ***relationships*** *with drugs*.\n\nPeace, fam. I feel you. Keep the love alive. Starve the ego, feed the soul. Consider making your passion the fuel for the inevitable future trajectory of harm reduction movements, once everyone as a society is willing to stop looking the other direction, and catches on to these issues...to these aspects of drugs, to these aspects of human nature, to these aspects of the relationship dynamics within & between drugs and human nature.\n\nDrugs don\u2019t kill people. People with drugs don\u2019t kill people. People using drugs in an irresponsible manner, kills people. \n\nThe right to bear substances. \n\nHarm reduction as a necessity (education included).\n\n*No felons made from a simple shipment, no lives ruined* for ... e.g. \u201ckratom being treated like heroin, by volume of possession, given schedule 1 state law,\u201d *even after discharge from prison, when no one can get a job prospect due to felony record from a harmless act* (or technically *harm-reductionist act*, given responsible choice to use kratom instead of PK\u2019s, within the instance being illustrated here), *resulting in a once-never-dealing-hustler becoming a hustler on the streets, picking up a drug dealing habit*, **coz there is no other option for a fully sustainable income, regardless of how much one never wants to do such an act.***\n\nTake that passion you feel, reading your post and my comment. Hone it into inspire the ineffably altogether foreseeable process of moving in the direction of progression into a \u201cpeace on drugs\u201d approach, as an educated society, all aspects of harm reduction idealism included, moving for such good being foreseeable from insights based on all hindsight of *each and every life ruined and tax dollar wasted*, from being willing to acknowledge the issues and drive a humanistic approach with aims to guide a movement that will no longer \u201ccuff and characterize someone as a drug user,\u201d and instead: \u201clend a hand to another human being, who happened to believe substances are innately possible to bear utility without causing harm, or, utility of reducing harm (considering the \u201clegal\u201d alternative option[s], in certain circumstances) with societal programs meant to resolve and humanize people who happen to have used substances, and reform this country in a peaceful and enlightening manner that Portugal has already proven successful, absolutely. Not to mention, salvaged a lot of health and money and resources in the process of reprogramming the societal view on *potentially-addictive* or *medically-viable-alternative-to-pharma* substances (again, kratom is a communal example), by noting one thing: *it\u2019s not the drug itself; it\u2019s the relationship with the drug, that causes issues* \u2014 and it comes from just-day-no abstinence programs that inspire undue curiosity from lack of education and empathy for those who have no other means of coping, and it\u2019s worth noting: \u201cno one gets addicted to drugs \u2022just coz\u2022 they wanted to get addicted to drugs,\u201d given that is not \u201cjust cause\u201d to refrain from education and keep banning and incriminating/incarcerating.\n\nNo one deserves a stigma that penalizes them for life, for an act or behavior, that, if decriminalized, could indeed could viably be *less harmful* than alternatives they have (suicide, pure unadulterated drugs, less fentanyl in cocaine, no need for ridiculous fluorinated cannabinoids, no overly potent and powder-only forms of benzos being eyeballed from lack of education) if we *stop banning researched substances, educate the public like we do with condoms and sex-Ed, realize people will do drugs even if it\u2019s illegal, and they mean no harm, by their under-informed course leading to their use*, only in [undue dis]order of *predictably creating greater dangerous substances, resulting in chaotic disarray that comes from such behaviors as a society* \u2014 **become the change you want to see in the world, and keep the light within, to enlighten the world to the infinitely valuable nature of justifying programs to help reduce harm and induce peace, as opposed to inducing harm and reducing peace with complacency about this pervasively inane \u2018war\u2019 on drugs with no aim.**\n\n*War on drugs \u2014 is not the answer.*\n\n*Peace on humanity \u2014 is absolutely the perspective that will bring optimistic, opportunistic, prosperous, prospective change that salvages countless human lives and livelihoods, while reducing harm, in the future \u2014 never standing idly by whole watching the country as they are actively inducing harm.\u201d Keep believing, keep your attitude, and keep all viewpoints reinforcing the legitimacy of such. Lives are at stake. We must evolve. A war on drugs is senseless, when no one wins, and it just escalates, revolving. No one \u201cbeats\u201d or \u201cwins against\u201d drug prevalence in society \u2014 to believe such is foolish. So when you can\u2019t beat them, join them, and make peace within a manner that causes less harm, not to mention, reduces crime and violence associated with cartel activity, and harmful analogs being created \u2014 only due to the secrecy with which drugs must be discreetly handled, and the legislation that causes nothing but devastation. When anything harmful keeps revolving, it\u2019s time to salvage the good and start resolving.\n\nA war on drugs is a pox on the people who are being stigmatized with regard to their usage. We need an antidote, it will happen. Help drive the movement, by never letting others\u2019 shade douse your light of insight.\n\nI apologize for my egregious errors with spelling, formatting, run-on sentences, syntax, typos, or editing necessity. I can\u2019t proofread something that gets me so fired up. Need to maintain my own peaceful threshold as well, and such involves refraining from reading all I rapidly wrote without even giving a single word a second thought. Rapid fire writing. Typing on my keyboard so loud it\u2019s as if I have a vendetta against it \ud83d\ude02.\n\nWorth keeping good faith we will change the world slowly but surely, with appropriate views (not unlike what you mentioned about legislatively limiting the amounts of personal usage without penalty, like Portugal\u2019s government does, so we are humanizing people without stigmatizing or punishing them, so ignorantly, so wastefully).\n\nKeep the enlightenment fired up with good intent. Remember \u2014 this whole life \u2014- not just drug usage \u2014- is about harm reduction, sparing health, and salvaging peace, foreseeably.\n\nGod bless. Keep the love alive. Keep the humility, don\u2019t delete your post, stand by your views, justifiably and righteously thrive. \n\n(This is no \u201csoapbox for me\u201d \u2014 what this is, is another viewpoint agreeing and *screaming* about it, from *a megaphone,* on the *top of a building*, for serious nature of harm reduction and prosperity of our entire future within the view of drug stigma and policy reform, for *the valuable necessity in discussing the matter itself, and all good prospective opportunistic worth therein.* That\u2019s... what this is)\n\nKeep the voice of the enlightened truth, louder than the rest. You rock, OP. Thank you for inspiring this diatribe from me. I needed to vent, for such good logic and insight-sparing worth. We all should, within reasonable views, with proven fact (Portugal!) of what will work to keep our world intact, without harshness of solely opinion when we all ...react. Let\u2019s keep this inspiration on track! War is wack.\n\n***There are no hard drugs or soft drugs.

Economically I\u2018d say im slightly right, germanys economy is pretty on point - capitalism but regulations in industries where its needed and a good amount of money goes to the poor and underdeveloped (although I\u2018d say that percentage could be a little more and real estate markets should be more regulated). Also a good minimum wage is definitely important- the us lacks in that department aswell. Minimum wage should always be tied to inflation - anything else makes no sense.\n\nBut considering authority I\u2018d say im quite lib, police is important, but regular police should not interfere with everyday life, and a regular officer shouldnt be able to carry anything more than a pistol. Plus idk where you\u2018re from (im from the eu) but I think the police has a little many rights in many US states. Also the US Law system is retarded, you shouldnt be found guilty of anything unless it can pretty much be proven that you were guilty. \n\nAnd I really dont wanna see a social credit score or some shit like that like in china, if I do some shit one day it shouldnt effect how im treated for another thing years later\n\nAnd the US prisons suck because they let that get into private hands - thats eg a point where I\u2018d say the state has to interfere, or in railway transport- look at the States, its nothing but shit in these two departments - look at europe - way better. \n\nNobody should be allowed to go into your house without your permission or with the permission of a judge because theres no way around searching your house to solve a serious crime problem. But IDK how many rights the police has there in the US. \n\n\nBut you know im somewhat anti authority (only to a weak degree tho) because some officers just suck, maybe they have a bad day and you didnt respond to their question in a way they like, maybe they just lost their wife because they fucked another one and wham suddenly you\u2018re found guilty of some random bullshit.\n\nAuthority is important but its just as important to regulate it as the thing is itself - otherwise everything turns to shit. \n\n(However I definitely dont support the people who want to entirely defund the us police or whatever, imo they should merely cut the rights of the officers here and there)\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nWow man that was a block of text haha I dont mind if you dont read it all if you dont have the time or something but I thought maybe you\u2018re in for a good ol\u2019 little drunk discussion on politics.\nIm always open to new views and opinions - even tho im 100% anti church I even read christian blogs or news pages sometimes - just not to lose touch with reality, I dont want to get lost in my personal bubble of social media filters.", "replies": {}}}}}}}}}}, "g4r2mfu": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ipzuq6/rant_each_time_something_gets_banned_i_lose_faith/g4r2mfu/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1599801257.0, "body": "How sure are you that your drug use hasn't effected others negatively?

Fact is the way you guys are are treating drugs is TOO liberal, and everyone will have problems with them at some point.. because no matter how good your mental power is, drugs can override your normal thoughts patterns, and before you realize it you are an addict or developed a severe health issue to something you possibly touted as safe for years. For example, all it takes for a casual for-fun user/every now and then type, is some bad shit to go down in life that takes you to a low where you feel like nothing can help you feel better, so you do the only thing you\u2019ve taught yourself to feel better which is drugs.

Research chemicals are still obscure, their properties and effects, especially long term ones, are studied to a small degree or not studied at all. Most of the time people don't even know and dont bother to think about what is in their batch of bath salts or \"spice\" or what's layed on the blotter of \"acid\". \n\nBy the way it looks like such carelessness and lack of knowledge is more dangerous relating to RC's in comparison with classical drugs. Real acid don't kill people, unlike new RC analogs and derivatives. Real weed is safe, but RC cannabinoids are not. Shit, even old and known opiates are somewhat safer than new RC opioids especially ones that are fentanyl derived. And plain good ol amph is safer than lots of new RC stims. \n\nWhy RC's became so widespread and popular if they are worse than classic compounds in terms of safety? And RCs are not only deadlier, but in a number of cases they produce worse \"high\" than old drugs.\n\nI have experience with a lot of drugs both regular and newly designed. DOB is worse than LSD (in terms of \"high\" and overall experience, and I tried it more than once or twice), A-PVP or MDPV are worse than old meth (smaller duration, more cravings and compulsivity, far shittier comedowns and narrower therapeutic intervals which means frequent overdoses). Synthetic cannabinoids produce stupid and most of the times not very pleasant condition, feels somehow resembling weed but with a plastic unnatural feeling, retarded jaw-hurting and unpleasant spontaneous laughing sessions sometimes for an half-hour in a row (not a case with the weed) and high potential for dependency and daily binges (unlike weed again). \n\nSo what can we conclude from aforementioned? RC's are overall worse than their well known respected \"founding fathers\". Yes, that's my personal opinion and it's a not always a case, but I mentioned some points to prove myself right. Btw I'd be glad to discuss on this topic if you disagree with my opinion. \n\nWhy RC's became popular then? In my opinion it is caused by the \"war of drugs\" around the globe which has gained momentum in the past few decades. RC's became widely used as an attempt to find a workaround. It was a loophole in drug prohibition laws. Who in his right mind would fuck around with some unknown chinese RC if there are familiar and reliable drugs? No one! (Well, there always were people interested in such stuff but it was a small minority.) And no one bothered indeed, until laws and governmental pressure made dealing with classical drugs too much of a problem for pushers and their clients. \n\nIs \"war on drugs\" effective then? No, they banned old drugs, people started to use new drugs. They banned new drugs, people synthesized a bunch of newer ones. You forbid deals with whatever compound - people will synthesize some derivative totally unknown before. In this chase narcs are always a step behind, they can't forbid every possible psychoactive substance in advance. \n\nGovernments around the world have tried to eradicate drug abuse by repressive methods for decades or maybe hundreds of years. Lets look on ethanol which is a psychoactive drug of abuse as well as every other substance of the sort. For some reason dumbasses still tend to draw an imaginary line between booze and other drugs, i.e. that's fine to have a beer or two in the evening but that's unacceptable to even say aloud something like \"I had some coke yesterday, shit was good\". What an example of Orwellian doublethink. This bullshit mindset someday will cease to exist, I believe.\n\nProhibition laws on alcohol both in USA and USSR has failed to cease alcohol consumption. People drank before, people drink nowadays and they will continue to drink booze in the future. These prohibition attempts only removed legal production from the market, along with huge chunk of tax income and QC (so people drank alcohol made not for human consumption like ethanol-based face lotions, liquids for cleaning windows etc). People didn't gave two shits about that laws and continued to drink, either brewing at home or buying from bootleggers. Even USSR with its notorious repressive state policies and ubiquitous propaganda failed in that 'war on booze'.\n\nSo why governments are still trying to use those ineffective flawed bullshit methods that failed to solve the problem before? With donkey's stubbornness they continue pointless 'war on drugs', even when more progressive countries like Belgium or Czech Rep. show that legalization of drug usage and creating a legal, white, tax-paying and controlled market have much better results both on public health and state budget.\n\nEither governments are composed of utter idiots, total retards that can't put a cube in a square hole and stop this idiotic \"war\". Or our rulers are not stupid and they understand that their actions are fruitless, and the only outcome is that number of people in jails is rising while drug usage remains the same?\n\nI guess it is impossible that everyone who occupies the high seat is retarded. There's simply not enough retards to fill all parliaments around the world. And these guys, presidents and ministers, really don't look like they all have IQ of a potato.\n\nSo they know that their actions will never achieve declared goal. And they are not stupid. And they have live examples of countries that decided to stop putting their citizens behind bars for drugs. These countries are doing good, levels of drug abuse or crime rates became lower after such reforms. In Belgium one can bring his shit to a public lab to be tested. In most countries one can't even publicly mention that he uses drugs, he'll have problems with cops, with his employer at work, his landlord and neighbours.\n\nWhy? I'm not into conspiracy, but this situation looks like some kind of... genocide? You pursue your people, you put them behind bars for years, ruining their lives, you brainwash nation (\"meth not even once\" campaign, yup, but not \"cigarette not even once\") instead of real harm reduction and education. And you do this while knowing that this actions are pointless, so it can't be justified as \"temporary violence for the greater good of people\".\n\nTLDR: don't waste your time reading, im on meth so i spent two hours writing this wall of text not in my native language, i only wanted to reply to someone's comment, but it went too far as you see.

As I mentioned before, this language is not my first so I guess I show more eloquence in the native language which Western people, sadly, don't understand. English is simple, lapidary I'd say, and slightly primitive (or rough?). Some thoughts are easier to express in English due to that properties. But my mother's tongue is much more profound, you can use a bunch of different words to describe something, and when general meaning leaves unchanged there are different tones to these variations, y'know? Also I think that our flexible grammar and free sentence structure adds another layer of expression. And of course our truly modular obscene vocabulary, it's possibilities are almost endless. Unlike English, sadly. Your language is good for some technical articles or for a boring free newspaper with local news and a tv program on the last page.\n\nAlso my eloquence may be linked with the fact that I'm in the 98.6 percentile as that free online IQ test stated.

I said that but only about blacks. And I meant African people of the negroid race. It is true that these people lived in a primitive tribal way in the time I talked about. Actually they had similar very primitive lifestyle and rudimental social structure even in a relatively modern era.\n\nHave you thought about how white colonists were able to capture black slaves in such big numbers, regularly, for decades? I'll tell you, primitive social structure of natives wasn't allow consolidation of tribes into something bigger. Whites exploited this \"fragmentation\" and also ignorance and naivety of the black people. On frequent occasions colonists simply did a bargain with a \"princeling\" or a chief of local tribe. Tribal rulers have sold their people to whites. Any structurized and systemic resistance was impossible due to absence of statehood or any consolidating institutions. Whites frequently used local conflicts between neighboring tribes to own benefits. \n\nAnd you can witness echo of that times even now. Black countries are mostly poor, undeveloped, and in the state of permanent civil war. That fragmented structure with a shitload of different tribes (nations) can be seen even today in Africa, remember secession of the South Sudan, that conflict had roots not only in religious differences. \n\nMajority of developed African black countries started to grow only after white colonization. When white colonists were sent out after a revolution these countries immediately slowed down temps of economical growth and went back to shit. Zimbabwe is a perfect example and proof of my words (also it's a rare case of black country that had at least kind of statehood, decent military power and beyond-national institutions, thanks to the king Shaka). When Zimbabwe was under brits and was called Rhodesia, quality of life, economic indexes and temps of growth were decent, Rhodesia was among the fastest growing countries in the region. Then black people decided that they no longer need bad white invaders, it's time for the independence and shit. After only 20 years without whites Zimbabwe dug itself into shit beyond any limits. Now this country exists only to be the source of memes and jokes, Zimbabwe is generally synonymous to \"fucking shithole\" now.\n\nYou see, bro, can you understand what I'm about now? Negroid people (it's not offensive, just a scientific term) even today live in crap, and reason for this is same as to black slavery. And I don't say that all niggers are stupid ass-naked ooga booga baboons, God forbid. When black people are incorporated into a developed progressive society they can perform great, like N. Degrass Tyson (if i spelled the name right). So no hard feelings, just in case, no offense was meant by me.\n\nSumming it up: people of the African negroid race lived in trees (metaphorically), not \"other races\". And aforementioned people continued to live in trees to the most recent times. And today they are still mostly living in trees (metaphorically again), but now we call it \"slums\" or \"ghettos\", and instead of real trees they started to use chipped bricks, rusty metal sheets, and other garbage.", "replies": {}}}}}}}}, "g5hfj28": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/itk2xf/rise_of_rcs_and_drugs_prohibition/g5hfj28/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1600301935.0, "body": "What you're saying makes a lot of sense.

While this is awesome with Cannabis because THC alone is meh without CBD (and the plethora of Cannabinoids contained in Weed), this is not so awesome with Magic Mushrooms because it gets hard to replicate a specific experience. Drugs in their pure forms also have the advantage of being easier to weight, because you know exactly how many milligrams of a substance you are taking.\n\nAlso, some RC's are really uniques. This is the case of MXE, DCK or O-PCE compared to regular Ketamine/PCP for example. Not even speaking of 2C-B, 2C-E or 25e-NBOH, which, IMO, have the qualities of their mother (Mescaline) without the nausea, too long duration, etc. RC Tryptamines offer every aspects of Magic Mushrooms, but you can pick the aspect you want like if there was a setting menu. This is some gourmet shit if you research well beforehand.

Note that I have been prescribed Seconal (one of the most addictive drugs) in the past and stopped it without a second thought. I also have no addictions and I am 49 years old.\n\nUsed to think I had chronic kidney stones so I went to the ER frequently. Often there was a stone but sometimes there wasn\u2019t. I had always assumed I simply passed it.\n\nIn 2014 I had severe pain and visited a urologist who did a CAT or MRI and found no stones and send me to a spine pain specialist. As it turns out I had broken my back when I was much younger - maybe 14-15 years old (see image). Of course, I didn\u2019t know that at the time but I did have a significant fall.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/tAcn69B.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/tAcn69B.jpg)\n\nI was treated with cortisone shots in my spine and the pain vanished within a day or two. That lasted about four years which I\u2019m told is considered a great outcome.\n\nOver the last couple of years this pain has been increasing. I had more cortisone shots about a year ago. Those helped for about two weeks and since that time it has only grown worse.\n\nAt this point I have to stay in bed for 2-3 days in order to be more mobile for a day without massive pain. As a result I have gained a lot of weight (up to 400 lbs), so exercise has become more difficult. Walking almost any distance is painful. Sitting upright for long periods of time is painful. I am doing intermittent fasting combined with Keto to help weight loss but there is only so much that can do with such inactivity.\n\nThe spine pain specialist told me that medications will not help with the exception of these cortisone pills which I can only take twice a year. I believe he may be right as at one time I did try taking Hydrocodone and there was absolutely no discernible difference in the pain.\n\nSO MY QUESTION is:\n\nDoes anyone know of anything that may be much stronger that could help me be more mobile to the point where I can lose enough weight in order to qualify for spinal surgery? I know nothing about OxiContin or Fentanyl. I\u2019m considering seeking help from a pain control doctor of some kind, but if there is likely nothing that can treat my pain to some degree I won\u2019t bother.\n\nI really need some guidance here. I\u2019m concerned that I may end up with a pain specialist who is more of a pill mill. I need help, not a high. In fact, I think the only time I have ever experience anything like that was at the ER with huge doses of morphine and I\u2019m not interested in a feeling other than NOT HURTING when I need to be more active.\n\nAny advice or thoughts are appreciated.

I'm a few years younger than you but my body is probably twice as old as yours. I was an Offensive Lineman through college (UMICH'93-'97). I'm 6'8.3\" and 267-270lbs now but target playing weight was 340lbs and I made it up to 390lbs a few times during the off-season (I was also 6'9\" on the nose 20 years ago).\n\nMy body is a fucking mess, my knees not too bad but my back is cursed. Team doctors used to hand out 180ct scripts of Vicodin and Percocet, which I continued well after school. Starting in my 30's after 14 surgeries and dozens of steroid injections in the spine and nerve ablation procesudres (which burning of the nerve roots worked the best), my pain management doctors (also at University of Michigan) moved me over to the Fentanyl pain patch (100mcgr/hr on day 1 of 3 and another 50mcgr/hr patch on day 2-3) plus 10-20mg Opana (oxymorphone) 2-3 times a day for breakthrough. Fentanyl didn't work very well for nerve pain and being a purely synthetic opiate, made me super grumpy all the time. Natural opiates like Vicodin and Opana. give me a warm feeling and lift my mood.. and while taking opiates the mood natural opiates put me in did more good in helping me ignore the pain than it did blocking it.\n\nI couldn't stand taking opiates any longer though, I got pulled over once and had pain patch wrappers in my car (I would put one on out in my car before work and just toss the wrappers in the pocket of the door, but I didn't have the box they came in and got arrested in front of my children. So I told my doctors I was taking myself off everything and was just going to live with the pain. My pain management doctors said \"please, don't do that\" and wanted me to try Suboxone (the opiate abuse treatment drug) for the back pain and it worked better than anything else I had tried and I would recommend that to most people, but for me it was still not enough to justify all the hassle of monthly DR visits, monthly blood work, and monthly blood drugs tests, etc. I took that for a year before hearing about Kratom. I took myself off the Suboxone, tried Medical Marijuana for a few months which didn't do anything for the pain and then finally gave Kratom an honest effort. That was 4-6 years ago and I haven't stopped taking Kratom since. It works amazingly well. My dosage is the same as when I started and I get around as well as my 75 year-old father now, where he used to get around waaaay better than me.\n\nAnyways, I feel or have felt exactly where you're at. Have kids that need their pops but am not looking forward to the pain getting any worse. Before I found what worked and made the pain tolerable for me (Kratom), I thought about suicide, hoping my kids would understand that the pain was so intense that I spent 70% of my waking hours unable to think and only be able to say \"omfg, omfg, omfg, please stop hurting, omfg\".\n\nMy best recommendation: throw the book at it. Go to a pain clinic. They treat not only the symptoms of pain but also the psychological aspects of it too. If something doesn't work, ask them to try something else and they'll usually oblige.", "replies": {"fhw8vcx": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/f4gqse/severe_back_pain_help/fhw8vcx/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1581938108.0, "body": "Wow. This is an amazing reply! Here's some gold. And here's why:\n\nFirst off, you made me fell a lot less sorry for myself reading what you have been through. Being arrested in front of your children for your pain medication. Unreal.\n\nI have a few questions and I may DM you on some of this:\n\nHow do you go about finding a good pain medicine doctor for this kind of pain? I think we have the same kind of pain which is being caused by pinching nerves in the spine. It hurts worse than anything I can imagine (and I've had plenty of kidney stones). I am in the process of looking for real help now. Since my spine pain specialist told me no pain meds would help me, and after trying Hydrocodone and having ZERO relief like I took nothing at all, I kind of gave up. After watching The Pharmacist on Netflix, I rather ironically started to think about getting help as my life is not improving. I feel it is getting worse and fast. This is the first time in my life I had to come face to face with the fact that I am actually... mortal. Why are men/boys so damn stupid?\n\nBased on a lot of recommendations, I tried Kratom this morning and then I had a very active day (for me compared to how it's been recently). Right now I am in incredibly pain, but throughout the day I didn't feel the pain anything like I had every day until today. They were sold in pill form, and there is no dosage per pill indicated. They also sell it in powder form. Since this may have worked for me, at least for today, could you tell me more about how you take that and manage it? I am absolutely clueless about Kratom other than my experience with it today that I am literally praying was not a fluke. I spent hours with my son working on installing a CarPlay stereo in his car. I cannot tell you how wonderful something that simple was to me considering how it has been for many months.\n\nAnything you can share on what you are doing and what did and did not work for you would be appreciated. I will also DM you.\n\nThank you for sharing man!!!!!", "replies": {}}}}}}, "efcpra": {"text": "Thanks for everyone involved in this great sub. Hope you have a nice day.

That is just plain wrong according to several nembers and I apologize for being so blithe. Please do your own research uf you're looking for a dose equivalent amount of C-LAM to your benzo of choice. \n\nComing up on my 2nd year of an addiction that cost me my beautiful family, a nicely equipped workshop with pretty much every tool imaginable for building motorcycles (Italian bikes, my hobby), landscaping my property, and basic repair work on my families vehicles. Not to mention the $20,000 in my savings account (crazy how fast an addict blows through his or her cash) \n\nTL;DR: I lost everything, including some actual clothes on my back!\n\n*I want to quit. I'm so fucking over this lifestyle*. But it seems most people don't think im *actually* serious about quitting because I can't and won't do it without self medicating. Maybe I'm a coward... The first thing that I feel as the wd begins to take hold is dread. I'm terrified of 6 hours of dope sickness let alone 3 days. As most opioid addicts know, the mental and physical symptoms can only be called hell. Despite the \"experts\" and their; \"oh, its like having the flu\". Nope. It's not. It's a torture rack. Evsry cell in your body is off. Basic bodily functions like your respiratory and digestive systems are haywire. Your actual bone marrow hurts. Your mouth is sticky and dry, eyes and nose running like a sieve. Red hot pokers stabbing your guts, doubling you over, getting out of bed to retch and dry heave every ten minutes isn't an option so you puke in a bucket next to your bed. You may even literally shit the bed. You're in so much physical and emotional pain all you can do is thrash around in bed, gushing with sweat, obsessing over how awful you feel. \n\nTL;DR: Withdrawal is absolute hell.\n\nIf you've gotten this far, thank you for reading. Now plz listen to my plan... Critique it, add to it, ask questions, just please be helpful.\n\nI've decided to order copius amounts of clonozolam and a mild opiate such as kratom to take the edge off.. The \"kick a little at a time\" approach. I do believe I have what it takes to use the kratom responsibly and only if I absolutely can not sleep without it. The clonozolam is the key here tho - I wanna be so zonked out on benzo sedatives that my RLS, mental terrors, all the actual fear is gone. I plan to load up on the kratom plus high doses of C-LAM, and by day number 3 continue the fight with just C-LAM, seroquel, and clonidine. Get myself to the point where I can transition to the pure buprenorphine pills I have stashed away.\n\nSo before I go shopping for RC's... I have about $500 I can spend. Looks like I can get a TON of most rc benzos dirt cheap... $350 for 500 mg of clonozolam, and from whst I read the clonozolam - clonozepam dose conversion is almost equal mg for mg. Are there other benzos I should be considering, maybe something closer to alprazolam that hits harder and faster? \n\nI already know what many of you are thinking - I'm going to trade a massive fent addiction for a deadly benzo addiction. And that will be true... at first. I've kicked enormous kpin and xanax habits before by tapering, and tapering off benzo is nbd to me bc I don't particularly care for them (benzos). They have zero recreational value to me. My last bout was scoring a womens stash of 1mg kpins she was selling - a years stash - 400 1mg blues. Developed a 12-15 mg/day habit. When I noticed my bag was getting low I quickly tapered my 10-15mg habit down to 5-10 within a month, then found a psych who gave me 3mg a day. I was fine. These rc benzos will be strictly for making my wd suck less, but I have no illusions that I'll instantly be fine on 2mg afterwards (assuming I conquer my fent habit). So please, just give me the benefit of the doubt that I'll be able to keep my benzo use under control.\n\nWell then... I have C-LAM as my benzo of choice, kratom as my parachute... Anything else I should add to this cocktail?\n\nPretty sad that I'm doing this much planning and drug shopping to get through what's essentially about 40 hours, long enough to get back on subs. What can I say, I'm a wuss.\n\nSuggestions for alternative benzos and other RC's that may stimulate the opioid receptors would be great. If only *I can just fucking get a little sleep* I think I can conquer this. Being wide fucking awake for 3 agonizing days and knowing $20 worth of dope will end the misery is not an easy thing to do.\n\nThank you all for reading this and for your input. I know this is a bit of a rambling post. With the wide world of RC's we now have at our disposal, there's never been a better time to self medicate...

The following is somewhat based off my education but mostly based off of my personal experience as an addict. \n\nHave you ever detoxed at an actual medical detox facility? Because these are all just drugs they would give you there. Except not propranolol. \n\nThey typically prescribe you gabapentin, clonidine, hydroxyzine, and a little bit of valium in my experience. \n\nI would use all of those, and then add some\nOtc meds. Such as cbd/thc, multivitamin, kava, ashwaghanda, phenibut. If you want a longer but less intense kick, you can try doing a suboxone taper, but assuming you don\u2019t have easy access to that, Kratom is an absolute godsend. I would never kick without kratom on hand. Some people have had success with Imodium, but I personally wouldn\u2019t use it with the purpose of alleviating withdrawals, it\u2019s also dangerous in high dosages and can induce extremely bad cardiovascular damage when taking high dosages for long periods of time. I do recommend using it for its intended purpose, as an anti-diarrheal at normal doses.   \n\nAssuming you are in the USA, the only meds I\u2019ve listed that would raise a doctor\u2019s eyebrows are Valium and suboxone. A psychiatrist who knows your situation would likely be willing to write you a tiny script for say Valium 5 mg x 8 for a quick 4-6 day detox. If he doesn\u2019t want to, no big deal. That\u2019s why I listed so many alternatives. Getting into a suboxone program with a licensed physician is somewhat hard and expensive to do, and most psychiatrists aren\u2019t even allowed to give subscripts. You can find a licensed one near you on suboxone.com. \n\nThe quickest, easiest, and least expensive method would be to ask your doctor or psychiatrist to write you the scripts for those 4 detox drugs up above. Or just the first 3 and substitute propranolol for Valium if the doc is uncomfortable with benzos. and be upfront that they are for detoxing off of opioids. I\u2019ve never had a doctor argue or say anything. Then on your own, get the otc meds, supplements, vitamins, and Kratom.

I kept getting my mind blown every time I took the no2, kept saying I figured everything out and it turned into a joke in the end because after every hit I took, I would remember that I was going to forget everything and then I realised I kept forgetting everything because the information I was receiving was meant to be kept a secret as I was unable to speak out loud the ideas I was getting. Eventually I managed to pull some information out, writing down things as well but I don't know if I remembered this 'secret'. I figured out that I was merely a thought travelling through still frames of reality and that time was created by travelling through these still frames one by one like a digital video. It looks like a lag effect. Every frame of reality exists at once in the Universe; past, present and future. The Universe is like a finshed film and time is the illusion of movement created by travelling through these still frames of the film one by one, from start to finish. I also figured out that our conscious is nothing but a chain of thoughts and memories, a chain of moments of reality. Every thought connects with a unique reality or dimension. Our thoughts mirrors our environment and we are moulded by the thoughts and moments we remember. We can change who we are by changing our thoughts and memories. I had contradictory thoughts all the time too. I remember being a thought and the environment at the same time, kinda like the quantum cat theory, I felt like I was alive and dead at the same time as well. I eventually realised that everything in the Universe exists on a spectrum and that the world isn't black or white. We are a mix of two opposites which means I could be 90% alive and 10% dead and that makes me healthy and energetic or I could be 60% alive and 40% dead which makes me sick and have no energy. Gender is mixed too and defined by masculine and feminine energies. I could be 80% masculine and 20% feminine which makes me a man or I could be 45% masculine and 55% feminine which makes me a tomboy. 90% feminine and 10% masculine would likely make me a girly girl. We are all a mix of light and dark energy, good and bad, yin and yang. The spectrum theory really helps me understand why the world works the way it does. One other thing I remember as well is that I felt like I had no control over the thoughts I was having, it felt like my mind was mirroring the environment and it was the environment that was in control of my thoughts. For example, if I wanted to take another hit of the No2, it was the energy of the No2 itself that gave me the thoughts to huff it. If I wanted to eat a burger for dinner, it was the collective energy of the burger that gave me the thoughts to want to eat one. It's like all matter has a purpose and we get thoughts based on the environments energy and purpose. This has led me to start to believing that everything in the Universe is consciousness and I'm now experimenting with the idea that the conscious environment controls the everyday thoughts that you have. MDMA and No2 together is truly a powerful experience and I've always had mind blowing trips every time. Who knows what I'll find out next, what do you think of the information I got out of this mix?\nI've never had experiences this mind blowing before.", "replies": {"fiyec40": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/f9f7hs/my_research_chemical_and_drug_review_compilation/fiyec40/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1582866568.0, "body": "Consciousness is energy and the universe is an ocean of energy.

Love you all. Wanted to make a follow up post to my last one on the relatively unresearched synthetic opiate, AP-238\n        \nI had one intranasal session a night starting 2 weeks ago, skipping maybe 2-3 nights. I would do 10-20mg lines at a time, never exceeding 50/60mg per session. The drug itself was very chill, provided a nod that is personally preferable over fentanyl or heroin for me (no opiate addiction history or tolerance ever, just experimentation) The past 3 nights I have stopped using daily and would like to update on my nasal side effects. \n  \nTo begin, my nose would be constantly clogged and full of mucus boogers throughout the day after. Every morning I would blow my nose several times in the shower, producing disgusting looking partially solid mucus with opaque white or yellow color. On the first day of abstinence I decided to do some 2-FDCK again for the first time in several months. It was awesome, and I even unintentionally holed harder than I ever have before! It was great, but I think it made my nose even worse. Since then, whenever I blew my nose one nostril would have blood in the snot but not be continuously bleeding. \n  \nNow, after trying to blow my nose at work and clean up the mucus, it just started bleeding. And whenever I try to blow it gently or sniff too hard it starts bleeding again! Absolutely nuts side effects for not that much general substance going up the nose. I\u2019m interested to see how long it will take for my nose to return to normal. I plan to make a final report of AP-238 intranasal research once it does.\n   \nThanks for reading!", "author": "silverexe", "score": 74, "flair": null, "created": 1597226034.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/i84zi6/nosebleeds_random_stinging_and_nasal_congestion/", "num_comments": 60, "title": "Nosebleeds, random stinging, and nasal congestion from new RC opioid AP-238", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"g166rjb": {"score": 46, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i84zi6/nosebleeds_random_stinging_and_nasal_congestion/g166rjb/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597226883.0, "body": "[removed]", "replies": {"g166tuh": {"score": 10, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i84zi6/nosebleeds_random_stinging_and_nasal_congestion/g166tuh/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1597226918.0, "body": "I believe so, I\u2019m going to start experimenting with that ROA from now on.", "replies": {"g17c0xr": {"score": 7, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i84zi6/nosebleeds_random_stinging_and_nasal_congestion/g17c0xr/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597259831.0, "body": "nevermind, just plug it!", "replies": {"g17u2hy": {"score": 5, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i84zi6/nosebleeds_random_stinging_and_nasal_congestion/g17u2hy/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597271675.0, "body": "plugging burns badly", "replies": {"g19q3vu": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i84zi6/nosebleeds_random_stinging_and_nasal_congestion/g19q3vu/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597303308.0, "body": "never experienced burning, but I never took AP-238", "replies": {}}}}}}}}, "g166ztz": {"score": 15, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i84zi6/nosebleeds_random_stinging_and_nasal_congestion/g166ztz/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597227009.0, "body": "wym bruh snorting battery acid gives me a hard on", "replies": {"g185x15": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i84zi6/nosebleeds_random_stinging_and_nasal_congestion/g185x15/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597277554.0, "body": "I only boof battery acid", "replies": {}}}}, "g16m6vy": {"score": 23, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i84zi6/nosebleeds_random_stinging_and_nasal_congestion/g16m6vy/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597236068.0, "body": "God its like none of you read reports.", "replies": {"g16w35s": {"score": 31, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i84zi6/nosebleeds_random_stinging_and_nasal_congestion/g16w35s/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597244046.0, "body": "I don't know why anyone is downvoting this, they're absolutely right.

I am CaptainEtazene and I'd like to write something about etazene.First of all, it is a very strong opioid. It differs slightly in action from classic opioids. It is a molecular speedball. If you take little, you feel everything at once: euphoria, speed and relaxation. If you take more, euphoria is growing, but the opiate action profile is getting stronger, until you finally fall into opioid drowsiness. Compared to isotonitazene and fentanyl, it was hardly seen to cause respiratory depression. Removal of the nitro group [https://imgur.com/in8mfuX](https://imgur.com/in8mfuX) from etonitazene caused smaller respiratory depression, less hypnotic properties and increased speedball effect.After that, you can work normally and be even more productive than when being sober. Just don't overdo with dose. Small doses - euphoric; high doses - heavy opioid.\n\n*How to dose it?* For total opioid beginner: 0.5-1 mg per spray in nasal spray, causes high euphoria and a feeling of soft legs. 1.5-3 mg already makes you fall asleep.\u00a0 When someone took 30 mg of pure he vomited, went on all fours but was happy.\n\n*How about tolerance?* It grows terribly fast. Within a few days, the dose to be taken to obtain the desired effect can increase several times. There's cross tolerance with other opiates.**The important thing is that a dose depends on the method of administration and what etazene is administered with**!!! For some routes of administration higher dose is needed! Ask your vendor which administration route is best to use for a given etazene product.

For nearly a decade now, actually. Somewhat recently, my dose became much higher than I was comfortable with and began searching for other options. \n\n\nI learned about opioid RCs a bit too late apparently, since the ideal compound for me was apparently gone (isotonitazene). The next best thing was etazene, at 25x the potency of morphine. It\u2019s an analogue of etonitazene, which has urban legends surrounding it and horror stories of its own.\n\n\nAnyway, my fentanyl use had exceeded 30mg a day at the point of my acquisition of etazene, which was just unacceptable due to the ups and downs it caused. I began dosing etazene, by itself first thing in the morning, beginning with 50-75mg to start. \n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t quite enough, so I upped my dosage to 100-150mg, and found this to be quite acceptable. The euphoria is absolutely there, challenging any opiate/opioid I\u2019ve ever tried honestly. Pain relief is wonderful as well, and general sense of motivation+well-being as well. Not like the euphoria I get from fentanyl at all, really (and yes, I DO get euphoria from fentanyl).\n\n\nOver the last two months or so, I\u2019ve managed to drop my fentanyl dosage to 10mg per day, and have kept my etazene usage about the same as initially. I\u2019m not trying to quit anything right now, my life is actually pretty great to be honest, I don\u2019t have anything to complain about aside from my dependencies. \n\n\nAll in all, I\u2019ve found etazene to be a great substance for my needs. No weird side effects noted, and I\u2019ve been using daily for ~2-3 months now. It\u2019s been a wonderful addition to my \u201cprogram\u201d and has aided in doing something I didn\u2019t think possible. \n\n\nI must stress that my doses are NOT typical, and should not be taken by anybody that isn\u2019t already at my level of tolerance/dependence.

I'm going to provide links to the monographs below for you all to view. You can also find my growing  monograph collection (based on my 15 years of experience in the clandestine chemistry field) via my username: [u/DuchessVonD](https://www.reddit.com/u/DuchessVonD/)\n\nEven for the non-chemist on this sub, it will give many of you an idea of what goes on during the process of selecting analogues to pursue in the Research Chemical field and a bit about the bizarre off-color and off-the-cuff ideas that go through the head of a research chemist by day, clandestine chemist by night. For those who lack a sense of humor and lack sarcasm and appreciation for flippant sarcastic banter, you may not enjoy my monographs that much. They are far from cut and dry musings of experimental procedure and strictly lab-based chemistry. There is a lot of social commentary, history, literature review, pharmacology, as well as a phat bong rip of chemistry. I must admit that most of the stuff that goes through my head during my free time has little to do with chemistry, sometimes it gets a little \"colorful\" especially for a little Jewish Jersey girl like me. \\[check out my **Poetry-Dope Rhymes** section below for more details\\]\n\nThere's  something for everyone \\[interested in opioid research chemicals that is, but I will hit upon methaqualone analogues as well as benzodiazepines and have a discussion on 4-methylaminorex in my monographs\\]. Or there will be in the coming weeks and months as I have time to summarize my decade and a half long work in this arena and format these notes/commentary into my trademark-style of monographs. I try to focus on the unusual **Opioid X-Files**: mostly legal  analogues, consisting of the good, the bad, and the ugly of the lesser  known alleyways of the opioid class. Some are legitimately wonderful and euphoric. Most notable of these uniquely Duchess explorations is the revival of two old school Janssen opioids:\n\n(a) the ethyl ketone of despropionyl-beztramide (**Etodezitramide**)\n\n(b) And the highly euphoric N,N-Dimethyl analogue of dextromoramide/racemoramide known as **Dimethylmoramide.**\n\nIn my latest monograph addition I describe my experience synthesizing and commentary on the pharmacology of **phenomorphone** (N-phenethylnormoxymorphone), which is synthesized through a variety of reverse engineering N-demethylation procedures for oxymorphone, which I have dubbed ***Duchess von D-allylation***, *N-deallylation of naloxone into noroxymorphone which undergoes N-alkylation into phenomorphone*, which has a euphoric potency (not equivalent to a toxicity or analgesic potency) of fentanyl, but with more euphoric properties and an all-together different (in my opinion better) high than that of fentanyl, methadone or even heroin. Nonetheless, I find its high to be uniquely enriching and the buzz altogether wonderful.\n\nOther analogues that were less successful are still discussed and mentioned, I consider these my deformed back-alley abortion brain babies. I tend to  write without a filter, so you'll have to put up w/ a blend of my  mental abortions, usually of the coat-hanger variety: esp. *my highly  politically incorrect discourse* (which peppers my monographs throughout).

Microwaves do  serve other important purposes during the process, such as isolation  and purification steps (and for making \"Mack\" methadone free base crack  and \"Frack\" fentanyl free base crack) as well as the processing of the  intermediates.\n\nMicrowave etonitazene (***nukenitazene***)  was redeeming for its rapid access to the etonitazene molecule as well  as its utility for obtaining other analogues of the benzimidazole  scaffold. Etonitazene through conventional means \\[FI Carrol and  Coleman's 1975 EEDQ mediated synthesis\\] required a total of *9 days of reflux*.  As with the methadone nitrile synth, the scale-limitations put a  ceiling on its practicality, limiting batches to < 25 grams.\n\nUsing  a time-pulsed temp regulator (these are different from variacs)  combined with a MW that has an internal % power setting, the *clandestinist* can achieve ***Manifest Microwave Destiny***  and calibrate a consumer grade MW oven for use as an ideal laboratory  aid w/o physical modification of the microwave proper. The power output  can be estimated by taking the value provided by the manufacturer (i.e.  1000 W microwave oven) and then multiplying that by the % power setting  built-into the MW oven user interface. The best solution for the  homebake MW chemistry were the 10% and 20% settings on a 1000W MW oven.  This helps the clandestinist estimate the power range of their adapted  oven and compare it to lab-grade MW reactors and their associated  reaction wattage (which are specified in the literature).\n\nStirring  in the MW oven can also be tricky. It is best achieved by either  limiting your rxn scale so that stirring is unnecessary, or finding the  biggest baddest magnetic stirrer out there, disassembling the top  ceramic surface, and substituting the existing magnets with super  strength neodymium rare earth magnets. Those bad boys will whip that  solution like *Marquis de Sade in a Bangkok brothel.* The setup will have no problem with the *MW-stirrer double team*: churning up magnetic *cream*, while you *ream* it with a microwave *beam*.\n\nMost  of the \"magical MW effect\" mumbo jumbo (termed the non-thermal MW  effect) in the chemical literature is misleading. Most of the so-called  MW effect on rxn thermodynamics and kinetics is due to the increased  pressure resulting from conducting in a sealed vessel and the rapid  heating achieved as a result of using pressure vessels. Conducting a  reaction under pressure outside of the MW using a conventional heat  source will probably achieve the same effect, although usually quite a  bit slower. There is a Microwave Scale Disadvantage though, which is  readily apparent in the opioid syntheses that I adapted for home MW oven  use. The lack of MW interaction w/ many nonpolar organic solvents  limits the versatility. If something has the the polarity of benzene or  one of the n-hexane/pet ether solvents, you are going to have problems  getting that rxn working in the MW.  But high polarity solvents such as  water, DMF, alcohols, acetonitrile and ethers/esters/ketones, those work  splendidly...sometimes too well as their rapid heat and resulting  pressure can shatter containers. MW Explorers beware of shattered glass  in the early phases of your exploration, b/c there will be plenty. Let  the shattering begin! \\[this can be avoided by using PTFE pressure  vessels, the sweet spot being in the 50 mL range.\\]", "author": "DuchessVonD", "score": 85, "flair": null, "created": 1583854993.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/fga7un/duchess_von_ds_clandestine_rc_chemistry_monograph/", "num_comments": 19, "title": "Duchess von D's Clandestine RC Chemistry Monograph Series: von D-allylation of Naloxone to Oxymorphone - Vinyl for Your Veins: Bringing out the Narcotic in Narcan - The High-Efficiency Conversion of Naloxone into Noroxymorphone - Essential Euphoricopeia of the \u00e9galitarisme chimique: Phenomorphone", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fk3hxu9": {"score": 20, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/fga7un/duchess_von_ds_clandestine_rc_chemistry_monograph/fk3hxu9/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1583863180.0, "body": "this belongs in /r/TheeHive", "replies": {}}, "fk3izxm": {"score": 6, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/fga7un/duchess_von_ds_clandestine_rc_chemistry_monograph/fk3izxm/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1583864588.0, "body": "I've seen you on the vespiary!", "replies": {}}, "fk7xfq8": {"score": 6, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/fga7un/duchess_von_ds_clandestine_rc_chemistry_monograph/fk7xfq8/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1583974217.0, "body": "You're the coolest person on the internet.", "replies": {}}, "fk96py9": {"score": 6, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/fga7un/duchess_von_ds_clandestine_rc_chemistry_monograph/fk96py9/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1583998642.0, "body": "You are hands-down the most interesting person I've ever seen online", "replies": {"fkdfaa1": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/fga7un/duchess_von_ds_clandestine_rc_chemistry_monograph/fkdfaa1/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1584105529.0, "body": "I can fluff a lot more than pillows.\n\nIn certain cases of Viagra-resistant erectile dysfunction,\n(we're talking about the really sad cases here, such as those who watch a porn and willow)\n\nThey've successfully trialed an experimental treatment known as \"von Dillow,\" watching the Duchess take a Dilly bar and give it a sloppy swallow,\n\nIt's more effective than a little blue pill at increasing a geezer's blood flow.\n\nSometimes I'm amazed at the content matter that I'll include in the pursuit of a rhyme.

Diff and the like you can get from overusing powerful antibiotics such as vancomycin, which I, of course, in my OCD-like manner, misinterpreted as vancomycin = terrible persistent AB-resistant infections), so I begin removing my IV line when this black female physician (I think she was Haitian) walked in while on rounds (w/ a gaggle of students) in the middle of me freaking out. I told that bitch:\n\"Listen here you stupid Caribbean cunt, I will get fucking Hallakah Krav-Maga KKK Karate on yo' ass quicker than you can light a fucking cross on fire in your own front yard if you don't remove this shit from my arm, apologize, and tell your students over there, 'I'm a dumb bitch who uses Vancomycin too soon, Please excuse me, I'm just a simple Caribbean coon.'\" (I had kind of thought about what I was going to say ahead of time, as I was fumbling w/ my IV line and getting frustrated with how securely they had ported it in) Despite my minute stature, when I'm freaking out, I can give lucifer a run for his money and win an ice dagger staring match with Charlie Manson. Of course, the KKK would be equally liable to leave a burning cross (or would it be a burning menorah?) in my front yard, but the Doctor didn't know that.

A quick search here on Reddit will render hundreds of posts discouraging use and telling tales of the horrid withdrawal but after reading so much about it I had to try it out for myself and to be completely honest I am pretty amazed. \n\nDOSE: 150mg of Tianeptine sodium Orally, dissolved in water (no opioid tolerance) \n\nNOTE: Tianeptine tastes horrendous, possibly the most bitter thing I have ever consumed \n\n\\--REPORT--\n\n0:10 - Feel a slight relaxation hitting me, placebo? Not sure at this point.\n\n0:15 - Suddenly feel a strong opioid effect coming over me, I'm begging to zone out looking at my screen and a strong sensation of warmth is spreading from head to toe.\n\n0:30 - Wow the rush was incredible, I have gone from completely sober to extremely high within the span of only about 20 minutes, I feel a strong \"stoned\" sensation in my head and have all of the classic opioid effects that one would expect from a strong opiate narcotic like oxycodone or hydrocodone (If not even stronger looking back). However the sedation aspect isn't quite there, I do feel spaced out and heavy-eyed, however I have been unable to catch a nod thus far.\n\n1:00 - After my previous entry I got in bed for the next half hour. Although still feel extremely \"opiate high\" and have now nodded off a few times the Euphoria is begging to fade. \n\n1:30 - Effects are still very strong and subtle itching is begging to set in. Although I feel incredibly sedated and disconnected from my body I haven't been able to nod as much as I normally would off other classic opiates. My body almost feels as if its sinking into my bed, really nice actually.\n\n2:00 - I'm begging to return to baseline. Although I still feel some pretty decent opioid effects I'm definitely past the peak and am actually starting to nod a little harder then before, possibly because the other non-opioid aspects of the drug are wearing off? The euphoria is pretty much gone however yet physically, I still feel amazing. \n\n3:30 - The effects are almost gone now. I still have a lingering opioid sensation through out my body but I am no longer nodding and mentally I feel very tired and still slightly spacey but almost baseline other then that.\n\n5:00 Effects are totally gone, although I barely still feel a slight comfort through out my body, mentally I am completely sober and ready to go to sleep.\n\nConclusion: \n\nWow for a legal RC this is amazing. Its by far the best legal opioid I have ever tried and kicks kratom's ass if you want a classic full agonist high. Its definitely not as \"clean\" feeling as morphine/fentanyl derived opiates but its damn close. For me It felt like a mix between tramadol and oxycodone, leaning far more towards oxy if not being even stronger in some aspects. Although the peak and overall duration is short It has an incredible rush and feels no different then a strong narcotic I would expect to be given by a doctor. \n\nHowever despite my praise this drug is not all good, as I'm sure many of you know it has awful withdrawals and due to its short duration is incredibly fiendish. This is mostly because although the bodily opiate effects linger about as long as oxycodone the euphoria fades rapidly within less then 2 hours and possibly shorter as tolerance builds. \n\nIn conclusion tianeptine sodium provides a slightly dirtier and shorter but arguably stronger oxycodone like high. It feels no different from a classic opioid and I believe the potential for abuse is no less. If you can see yourself having problems with opiate use or have been dependent in the past stay far away from this drug because although the high is good it will smash all classic opioids in terms of withdrawal and tolerance.

Since it's a tricyclic anti depressant it works on multiple systems, only one of which is the mu opioid receptors. Normal prescribed doses are 12.5 mg 3x daily, so recreational doses are roughly 10 times a singular dose. The issue with that is that a lot of the other mechanisms (serotonin reuptake enhancement, glutamatergic system downregulation) do not scale in the same way as the opioid effects.\n\nThis means that to get the desired opioid effects, people have to take massive doses that end up raising tolerance/activating other pathways really quickly and aggressively. This means that while normal withdrawal from opiates can be uncomfortable, withdrawal from tianeptine is like withdrawing from an opiate, an antidepressant, and a benzodiazepine/tranquilizer all at the same time, and after a shorter period of use than a typical opioid. It would be especially strong because of the doses being 10x+ the therapeutic effect as well, meaning someone unlucky enough to kick a tianeptine habit will be in for:\n\nrunny nose, achy bones, no energy, hot/cold flashes, stomach cramps/explosive diarrhea, increased pain sensitivity, extreme restless leg syndrome, extreme feelings of sadness/depression/hopelessness, akathisia, extreme anxiety.\n\nPeople should be able to choose what they do/put in their bodies, as long as it doesn't harm others. Drug education/awareness and freedom are extremely important and hopefully attainable in our lifetimes.  That said, this is a very powerful drug intended to be used in small amounts that works on a lot of systems in a not very targeted way.

For me, it totally destroyed my life, even if I was sticking with micro-dosing. It was not even a recreational drugs. A vey little euphoria, a very deep sedation, and I passed out countless of time.\n\nStopped and started again  5 times using, it, every time WD was worst and worst. I felt my body poisoned, same as my soul. The physical WD is not so terrible, you can taper with other 20-25x opioid potency, or with a massive dosage of subutex at the beginning.\n\nBut the psychological WD was the true hell. I never had in 30y of drugs usage panic attack and anxiety. Even after months I was clean from it, I still had those terrible conditions and I thought I'll never get back my life.\n\nBenzos or stims are not helping at all to cover those symptoms.\n\nLuckily is gone now. And, to make you a short recap of what is not around and avoid scams:\n\n\\- Isotonitazene doesn't exist anymore. Any seller claiming to have it, especially from china, is telling bs. You wil  get another Eto analogue.\n\n\\- Metonitazene: soon will be around. Analgestic potency will be 40-52x, bur euphoriant potency is pretty poor. So you will fuck your tolerance to have only a moderare recreational effect. It's less dangerous because it acts partially on dopamine receptors. A rough estimation of reports I had to far, for ppl with average tolerance, 2-5mg are approx 60-80mg oxycodone, but don't expect the same cool effect.\n\n\\- Etazene: lot of chinese seller are selling Etazene. Well, it's a lie as well. There is not Etazene shipping from china YET. it's probably some junk U-analogue cut with microdosages of Isotonitazene leftover. Etazene is anyway the most safe and closer to fenta anlogues (20-25x), smooth taste and works nicely smoked on glass pipe.People complains about Etazene because a) the batches around , and are only in Europe atm, are not consistent with potency b) it has very short legs (< 1h)\n\n\\- Fluonitazene: Available as well, Wikipedia says it's 25-40x but it's a wrong intel. This was on mices. Based on Etonitazene old research papers (1933), the question is still open. It could be a total trash, just 1/16 morphine potency, or could e a decent 7-12x potency analogue. Don't expect something amazing here as well. Only Etazene an Metonitazene share the similar structure or original compound, Etonitazene, and they are probably the best bet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStill, I Just hope for a blanked ban of all those analogues. They are PLENTY of amazing RCs not based on morphine that chinese could synth, with a low analgesic potency (<10x) but with an euphoric kick and body warm better than oxymorphone and even than some middle potency fenta analogues.\n\nBut they don't give a shit, they do the stuff that are cheap and with high analgesic potency to make happy all USA fenta junkies.\n\nOnly thing could be potentially decent is AP-238, 2-4x morphine potency, but so far got no reports.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStay safe.", "replies": {"fvl9g76": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/h12758/isotonitazene_synthetic_version_of_etonitazene/fvl9g76/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1592815175.0, "body": "[deleted]", "replies": {"fvnt5n6": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/h12758/isotonitazene_synthetic_version_of_etonitazene/fvnt5n6/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1592878905.0, "body": "That is not going to be like the good old fentas analogues, this is a fact already.\n\nBut the potency, close to fentanyl, is making it anyway a very viable compound for fentajunkies.\n\nI think that you researched something else.

Some people found Iso very euphoric and warm body nod, I never felt any of those, just passing out and the worst wd of of my life.

This was my first time ever trying this substance, and I only dosed intranasally. I weigh 160lb and am pretty skinny. I have no tolerance to opiates and I started with 15mg at 10pm. Within 10 minutes I felt a really nice opiate warmth, with heavy eyes and a spaced out headspace. For the first dose I wanted to see how long it lasted as I heard it was short. It was definitely shorter than most opiates I've done, and the high reminded me a lot of when I tried fentanyl by chewing on a piece of a patch. The peak effects lasted about 20 minutes and seemed to noticeably be going away about an hour after dosing, and I felt pretty much sober after 2 hours.\n  \nAfter I ate a little meal, I dosed 25mg intranasally and nodded even harder. I decided I wanted to maintain this buzz for a bit, and redosed 30mg about 30 minutes later, followed by 20mg every 30 minutes a few more times. Redosing this compound made it last as long as I wanted it to. The nod was very nice, extremely similar to fentanyl, but with less itches which is great. The burn is pretty bad at first, but if you're redosing it will not burn so bad after the first snort if you keep it in the same nostril. Hopefully my nose will recover quickly, as I've heard its pretty caustic stuff. I don't plan on using this substance again for at least another week, as I want to do some research on moderated usage and report any negative side effects that may come from having a session one night a week or less. Thanks for reading, hopefully you got some new info on this relatively unresearched compound. \n  \nI am definitely satisfied with my purchase. I also got some O-DSMT that I have yet to try.
