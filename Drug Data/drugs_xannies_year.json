You will still get addicted for the same reasons such as depression, boredom, problems with social skills etc. However once you are addicted, things take quite a turn. Hard drugs hook you physically and mentally in a way that weed doesn't. As I was saying, weed is about as bad as behavioral addictions. For you that's downplaying weed but that's because you view behavioral addictions as less severe which they really aren't. All I was saying is that the structures of weed addiction at mostly down to emotional and behavioral disorders.

It\u2019s funny I thought because I wasn\u2019t sharing needles and stuff (so no hep c) and was cleaner with using needles than my friends that nothing would happen. Well, you can apparently still get that shit even when being clean about it. I came so close to dying multiple times. Somehow my lungs recovered to near 100% (still can\u2019t yawn right all the time I get this suction in my chest it\u2019s real weird and same with sneezing sometimes my body won\u2019t let me sneeze. Both are getting better tho as time passes. \n\nI\u2019m scared to use. I used on days 2 and 5 in the hospital then decided to just get off the fent. So I withdrew for about 2 weeks while I was going thru the worst of it. I had my first bout of sciatica while all this was going on. I had to relearn how to walk and took no pain meds for the osteomyelitis even though it was severely painful. The iv antibiotics have messed up my kidneys a bit, but I\u2019m 30 and should heal up okay in the next month or two. Sorry for the long answer. I just hope someone reads this when they are thinking about quitting.... imagine withdrawing with all that other shit going on. You can get thru the withdrawals. If \nI did it with all that shit going on anyone can. \n\nI wanted to die the last 10 months since I started fent. Now I want to live and help others. I\u2019m grateful to be alive. I\u2019m truly scared to use for the first time in my life. I started at 18 on oxy too then eventually switched to iv dilaudid and opana, then last year made the switch to heroin then I found a good fent connect so I switched to that. God has blessed me with another chance and I\u2019m off subs and antidepressants too. It\u2019s fucking great not being dependent on anything. Had to put my dog down this week and dealing with a lot of outside stress, but none of these are reasons to use.... they for sure could be reasons, but they just aren\u2019t for me anymore.

Fuckin didn\u2019t even hurt my chest all the pain was in the center of my back. This was from IV heroin/fent use. Weird thing was I don\u2019t remember being scared I was going to die. I was either so depressed already that I didn\u2019t care about living or dying or I just dissociated. All I cared about was my IV dilaudid drip with 30mg methadone 3x a day plus I specifically asked for klonopin 1mg 3x a day and 60mg temazepam at night. I guess they gave me what I wanted one because I had great insurance and two everyone was convinced I was going to be dying anyway. I had a chest tube and a epidural also. They would bring me to another floor every few days and stick a long needle into my back and sucked black juice out and each time I swear there was like a liter of that flesh eating bacteria/blood/puss mixture. I eventually got robotic surgery to have it removed and let me tell you when I woke up I NEVER felt that much fucking pain. I woke up moaned really loud, the nurse said \u201coh that\u2019s normal it happens sometimes and than I blacked out when I started crying. I was in there for 5 weeks. The icing on the cake was the police put a warrant out for my arrest for not going into a police station to talk to them. Even if I was willing to do that I couldn\u2019t and they knew that but whatever they informed the hospital and they hid it from me the entire time. Wasn\u2019t until I got discharged and was cleaning my room up that I turned around and saw the cop standing in the doorway. Fucking got cuffed and had to sit in jail with basically fresh wounds and internal injuries. That\u2019s irresponsible and unethical. Than the fuckin jail tried to keep all my prescription slips. Took three days of calling the jail to actually get one of the cunts to go look for them.\n\n\nI had the pain in my back for two weeks. I went to the ER twice they gave me IV dilaudid and told me I had a UTI both times. I was laying in bed for 3 days in withdrawal and a fever basically dying. Than the hospital finally found out what it was. When I got a bed the doctor just spent all the time we spent berating me and my family saying \u201cit\u2019s his fucking fault he was using NEEDLESSS\u201d. My dad cornered him and was about to beat him to death but my mom screamed bloody murder. Than after repeated demands dad got me transferred to a respectable hospital where I actually started to receive the treatment that saved my life. \n\nGlad your alive and clean man that sounds like a heroic survival.

Every single one of them say the moment they started to die they regretted doing it, but there was no turning back. I can also vouch for that as it happened exactly like that for me too, and I'm so extremely thankful I survived. \n\nThe thing about suicide and depression is that it tricks you mind into thinking it's the only option, but it isn't.

FOH", "replies": {}}}}, "hgggtx": {"text": "Greetings to everybody. My background I want share. Firstly, this post is not to promote drugs, this post is to teach teenagers that are about to use drugs, and tell them the consequences, the downs, the depression, the brain damages, and all negativities.Because we adults definetly know that telling dont do is not gonna do anything :) So better guide for safety no one gets harmed.\n\nWhat things Below that I have used for long term what I call (1-6 months)\n\n1) Weed (3 years, every morning, every lunchtime, every afternoon , every night ; basically till I pass out peacefully, what I call dying :) )\n\n2) LSD( I did this 3 times, first one was Microdosing 25ug done for 2 weeks, second one for spirituality purposes which really scared me but no traumas thanks God that was extreme dosage 600ug, third time was more conscious and not crazy which was 250ug and that was a lovely experience walked outside slowly with Hiphop on my ear to cancel bad trips and stick to lyrics singing watching the sun rising, sittin on grass meditating with Theta Waves Sounds in my ear.)\n\n3) Mushrooms( Many many times, just for fun no spirtuality. I wish I done for spirituality after I made some research Mushrooms and meditating is real good one trust me. I tried the Chocolate ones, mushroom as itself ones original, and one time I did Mushroom which was the first time I tried I was a bit coward :) So I drank whiskey with it and it was really enjoyable but I ended up doing barfix with my friends outside at 3 AM injured my hand then I was saying funny things like \u201cDamn Im a Army Veteran, be a Soldier , bring me some whiskey we pour the this wound so bacterias die\u201d I was damn crazy, actually Im still crazy and fun for many people ahahah)\n\n4) Ketamine (I hated it, why the hell I would try that man. I dont like things that makes me dumb, slow thinking, slow response. But Im hyprocrite check out the 5th step and you get me)\n\n5)Codeine with Promethazine( My favorite, I got addicted to this one, I dont recommend to any of you guys, oxycodone too . Dont do it stay away! The withdrawals of it!?? Oh - My- Dear- Lord. Whole body hurts 24/7, when you lie down to bed it still hurts, you cant go to sleep, I even couldnt sleep with weed when I quit codeine , the weed was like not effecting at all, it was weird, and trust me I only get the A+ stuff, but overall I loved Codeine, calming down, but dangerous sometimes because if you miss the dose and keep goin your heart stops , its slows you that much.)\n\n6) lyrica(pregabalin 300mg) my favorite in the whole drugs industry. I was a extreme alhocolic. I would wake up at 4 AM, and start drinking at 12:00 lunchtime starting with 2 double whiskies, then go lunch and have some Wine, dont even ask the rest of the day, 70cl Whiskey mostly half of it, Weed included, sometimes xanax included. Real blackout. Why I tell this? Because Lyrica is the drug that make me quit Alcohol. Basically it makes me calm,chill, talkative, motivated, uplifted, energetic, always wanna chat with people , normally Im shy really :)\n\n7) Cocaine ( Maybe 7-10 lines working all nighter with coffee and weed to University things, was giving extreme dopamine to make me do work, but the wear off is like hell, and dangerous to mix with alcohol, so you have to hug the pain in this ones withdrawal)\n\n8) MDMA (my favorite, I took it and its like my friend touched my arm I almost came \u0131 swear. Its extreme warmness, extreme motivation, extreme talkativeness, very social, energetic, you would die because of the goodness of the music when you open it up. But stay away! Because I took it, and I was extremelly depressed, I sometimes cried because of sadness out of no where when alone , I cured this by weed, but Weed didnt even make me high at that time I swear on God.\n\n9)Extacy with Molly (I did this 3 times, all for celebrating after Uni Exams by the force of my ex evil. No blame but she introduced to me these chemicals, otherwise Id never do antrhing else than Weed. This is the best I can say but not good as Mushrooms and LSD, this was like you look at your friends face, his face turns to like Avatar like Blue Effects around Fire around, very visual but never bad trippin because it boosts your seratonin, you wouldnt trip bad on this.\n\n10) Homemade Ayahuasca (Syrian Rue+Acacia Confusa+Half Lemon Squeezed+Sea Salt one Nut large) - This was really good. But I tripped bad. It was a bad trip. Look , you see nothing scary, but you just feel like you so sticked to material world, and start feeling paranoid and unsafe. Ill figure this out and try again tho, am not gonna stop in this one.\n\n\nAlright so lets start the guidance;\n\nAs an example;\n1) If you taking MDMA always have a scale, and dont exceed the amount. When the MDMA wears of , if you cant bare the depression after that night dont take a second dosage ever, ever , never! Second dose can be good, but the next day? Im not even sayin only next day. The seratonin and dopamine will lack for months trust me. You wont find happiness for time.\n\nSo you took it measured it, drank some sprite for the bad taste (talking about pure crystal ones) \n\nEnjoy it, dont think bad things, and it wont make you think bad things this drug is like a happiness drug.\n\nDont mix with any alcohol, not even 1 beer. Are you gonna 100% die? No! But theres a chance of heart attack, statistics shows its more common in women. So dont mix. If you gonna mix with something and not listen to my words. Then mix with 1 pill of Extacy and enjoy it.\n\nWhen the effects are gone, only thing you gonna do, and nothing else! Is take 2mg of Xanax with water. Lie down, open some chill music, wait till sleep comes. Sleep, rest your brain. Thats how you dont damage your brain. If you awake eithout sleeping, you gonna be depressive mood questioning bullsh\u015ft things. So set OFF your brain, sleep rest. Wake up and drink organic mixture of fruits juice. Eat eggs. Start a nice day.\n\n\n\nFor LSD; 12 hours its gonna last. But 6 hours is the max climax. Same tactic when its off, take xanax and sleep.\n\nMushrooms, anything you wanna do is fine dont worry :) Its fun.\n\nWeed, do smoke weed when you on Mushrooms, when you on LSD, MDMA, Ex. Everything above. Always have weed with you roll like 5-10 rolls before taking the hard drugs. That weed gonna always put you in a calm trip relaxed trip.\n\nCodeine with Prometh; take 3 caps of codeine pour it in to Sprite bottle filled with Sprite, drop a Prometh for nausea , because it really makes you so nauseous otherwise. Never mix with alcohol . \u0130ts already strong calming thing you w\u0131nt need it. Dont exceed 1 week , to prevent addiction. Do this 3 cap thing max 3 times a day. Dont overd\u0131se its dangerous, you literally die.\n\n\nCocaine; you can multiple your doses at once. But just for once. Dont do all night. Take one bigline toright nose, take one big line to left nose. And you are fine for 1 hour. Dont waste the drug by taking more before 1 hour. Take xanax if you so depressed after your Cocaine finished at the end of the night.\n\nLyrica: Take 1 pill first, enjoy it its lovely. Next day take 600 up to 900 mg. \n\nOnly problem with high dose is it makes your hands shake , buzz. So if you use in public and get paranoid about gettin exposed only 1 pill enough to be social.\n\n\nMy hands tired. Ill keep writing my experiences. This is me when I was 19-20-21-22-23. Now Im off , just doing some xannies when I wanna celebrate.\n\n\nGod Bless you, always celebrate no medicate!", "author": "bleepyyy", "score": 363, "flair": "See Comments", "created": 1593235675.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hgggtx/safety_guidance_for_hard_drugs_and_prevent_brain/", "num_comments": 83, "title": "Safety Guidance for Hard Drugs, and prevent Brain Damage, minimize Depression my own Experience.", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fw46vo3": {"score": 219, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/hgggtx/safety_guidance_for_hard_drugs_and_prevent_brain/fw46vo3/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1593243560.0, "body": "To be honest I really don\u2019t think this is a very good post.

Found out my longtime girlfriend had cheated on me told her to lose my number and never speak to me again before and I just wanted to get fucked up. Oh boy did I. Also this gets a bit dark so heads up.\n\nTLDR: took 30 mg of Xanax lost 5 days of memory, got myself arrested, missed X-mas, destroyed basically everything in my room, got into a fight with my dad which escalated into me getting into my car and totaling it, I then went to my exes house bleeding from my mouth nose and forehead, and proceeded to hit her for the first and only time I\u2019ve ever hit a woman, tried to fight her dad got knocked out and cops arrested me. Cha cha real smooth right? \n\nTo start I was going to the plugs to pick up some blow,  at the time I died it when I got sad along with oxy when I could get it they didn\u2019t have oxy. At the same time she offered me some Xanax for the comedown and I just bought all 15 she had cause I had used it a few times before in 2-4 mg doses.\n\n Well I got home blew threw that blow like I always did and the comedown came as always at around 11:30pm I took what I remember to be 3 bars (6mg) and was chilling in my room, already barred out my brain was like \u201cyo let\u2019s do some more\u201d compulsive redosing is a bitch especially with those since I never feel anything from them besides falling asleep. Took all of them over 2-3 hours. Didn\u2019t fall asleep this time though.\n\nI woke up finally coherent in a jail cell on December 27 just shy of 5 days from initial dose. First thing in my head was wtf what happened, I had never been to jail or even arrested, I spit up blood still had no idea what was happening until a cop came in he gave me vague information saying I had done a bunch of dumb shit, they knew I was very high at the time when it occurred and that they held me until I was coherent again. Well my mom comes to pick me up hours later after I had proved I was sober enough not to hurt myself or anyone else, I still am so fucking confused cause the cops obviously didn\u2019t give a fuck about me being informed or just didn\u2019t believe me when I said I don\u2019t remember any of that. \n\nShe starts going into detail and by God had I fucked up. I had fucked up before don\u2019t get me wrong but nothing to this scale. She told me I came out of my room around 2 am on Christmas Eve and proceeded to fall down the stairs, ok not so bad, oh boy was I wrong. My dad came to see what happened and tried to talk to me I was slurring saying I was going out for a smoke and he went out there to make sure I was okay well we got into really into it I cussed him out said he was horrible bunch of other shit, I don\u2019t know why I did he\u2019s always been great to me even after all this, he obviously upset told me to go to bed and sober up my barred out ass said I\u2019m 100% sober proceeding to walk into the house smoking a cigarette which they hate and had ripped on me so many times for. We get into again now my whole family is awake wondering what\u2019s happening since usually I\u2019m just the pot head chill laid back whatever guy, and now I\u2019m yelling and throwing glasses breaking a ton of stuff.\n\nThey tell me I need to leave right now and sober up somewhere so I grabbed some random stuff from my room that had no use, and walked my high ass to my now ex-girlfriends house and started pounding on the door and yelling. It\u2019s about 3 AM she opens the door and tells me to leave since I seemed very drunk and we could talk when I was sober. I left after and walked back to my parents and sat in my car for a bit or just started driving it right then and there. Hit up the plug to get more coke at 3:30 looking at the text it legit said \u201cgolf more blue?\u201d No reply.\n\nSometime around 3:45 I remember a small snippet of me crashing just going about I want to say 30 mph, I remember the music was Dean Martin  \u201cAin\u2019t that a kick in the head\u201d when a dog or cat ran out in front I was like fuck you, swerved and ran into the metal cross rail head on. Walked my ass over to the Ex\u2019s house she saw I was bleeding from my head pretty badly and tried to help me but I was so fucking out of it I proceeded to punch her in the face.\n\nWhen my mom told me that I told her to pull over and vomited, I loved that girl with all my heart and it still hadn\u2019t even set in she cheated on me now I did this how? I had never laid hands on a woman like that in my life I hadn\u2019t even been in a fight before that night. It\u2019s starting to set in I really fucked up. \n\nOh there\u2019s more she says all I can think is fuck how am I not dead that was just 3/4 hours in and I don\u2019t remember the last five days. \n\nEx\u2019s dad comes in hearing me yelling about some bullshit and she\u2019s bleeding from her lip. He got aggressive which I don\u2019t blame him for at all and I tried to fight him. I was 160 lbs 6\u20190 and fit but nothing special. He was huge solid 240 6\u20194 fucking jacked dude knocked me out in one punch. Cops are called I woke up right before they showed not remembering what happened when I saw 3 cars with lights on outside.\n\nI was arrested on the spot after they tried to talk to me and I told them \u201cthey could suck me dry and I might start to talk.\u201d Arresting officer cuffed me after the dad told his side. Told me my rights and shit ya know, I was just being a dick at this point jabbing at them verbally any way I could. \n\nI remember none of being in jail. Guess I was just a drooling asshole. Thankfully, though I wouldn\u2019t be mad at all if he they did, her dad never pressed any charges and she didn\u2019t want to either. \n\nAnd now that\u2019s about that all the shit I did barred. But the post-Xannie rage, regret and shame I felt was horrible I had never done anything of that magnitude of fuck up in my life before not even close. I was a stoner and did oxy 2 times a week. Coke was just to make me feel better and the Xanax was just because I wanted to forget. My job had fired me at this point, no call they had no info besides what my coworkers saw on Facebook, lol.\n\nAt this point I kinda just packed my shit and started walking, what else was I supposed to do? I thought everything was over I planned on blowing my brains out with the revolver my uncle got me months before. Basically just went homeless sleeping at the park and couch surfing with my homie, until about a week had passed and the cops pulled in to talk with me at the park I was having a cigarette at. They said my family is worried and they wanted me to come home, they were there to take me home. Made my amends with my family wasn\u2019t easy and I was worse than when I left. Things had just changed for me, I realized I wasn\u2019t the person I thought I really was. When my phone turned on for the first time my god was that a shit show you can probably guess almost 100 missed calls and 200+ messages mostly my mom and my Ex. \n\nI called the Ex told her what happened she asked if we could meet up and I just told her it wasn\u2019t a good idea. I felt so guilty I hurt her a lot and even though she had cheated on me which I don\u2019t even consider what she did cheating anymore, she had confessed that she had been fucking around with her ex when we first started dating over 1 1/2 years before, I was just hurt and made a massive mistake in my overreaction. We met up a week later over coffee and she told me I looked like hammered shit which didn\u2019t surprise me I had been using oxy and when that went down I kept buying until I spent $500 in a night and went through the 500 mg in 9 days. Was in withdrawals during our meetup and then it just escalated to me just breaking down at the table and we had to leave and shit cause we were both crying. She was willing to try again and we did but it didn\u2019t last I just couldn\u2019t look her in the eye after what I had done. \n\nI\u2019m sorry guys if this seems so all over the place I genuinely have no solid memory of it I have bits and pieces like some of things I said to the cops but nothing else really. To this day I\u2019m obviously not the same well over 2 years later just turned 21 but I\u2019m happy. Haven\u2019t touched benzos in any form since that night. Although I did develop a nasty 2-3 gram a week black tar habit at my worst that consumed me for just shy of a year. But I\u2019m on subs now I live alone and make decent money as a computer repair guy. Stayed single since then I smoke my weed now and enjoy a beer or 6 at night but that\u2019s about as hard as I can go anymore without hating myself. The Ex is happy, she got married last year and we still keep in touch every so often she\u2019ll check up on me. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why I decided to post this and I know it\u2019s Long as fuck but please if you use benzos just be prepared for the benzo demon that can lay dormant until the times right.

I got into pills for a while when I lived with my mom and I think they caught ln that I was abusing pills. But anyways fast forward and I'm living with my grandma, grandpa,aunt, and her bf. I was so depressed last night and I couldnt stop crying so I asked if I could try one of my aunts anti depressants and she said she would have to ask her bf and I said cool sounds good. And when she went to bed I was still having sad boi hours so I went to the kitchen and I had a half a bottle of cough syrup from when I was sick... shit alright so I drank it to get my mind off shit and it really did help. I told my aunt I was so much less depressed when I smoked weed and drank and I woke up and heard my aunt and grandma talking about me and she thinks I'm going to become a drug addict simply because I'm in a bad patch and drank a little cough syrup. She also said that she \"counts her pills even though she knows I wont take them\" jesus fuck I would never steal her pills and she doesnt even trust me for that because I smoke fucking weed. Why is all my family so misunderstanding of what drugs can do to change your life for good? Honestly idk but multiple people in my family died to substance abuse and they all think I'm going to aswell. If it's to the point of them thinking that why couldnt they just talk to me or set me up with a doctor and get meds like I need. \"You smoke pot it's the gateway drug here soon your going to be shooting heroin in a bathroom at a gas station\" - My mom... like that's so stupid its someone's choice to do whatever drug they choose. Let alone it's all up to the person if they want to do it or not. Please dont think I'm degrading anyone for their drug choice,use, or addiction because I'm not going to be every other pot smoker on this sub and discriminate you for choosing another drug that happens to be harder. If you wanna shoot some heroin go for it. If you wanna smoke some meth fine by me. But what I'm saying is people cant just discriminate someone because they choose to use a drug they dont... it doesnt make them a better person because they stay clean. Maybe their life was horrible and that's why they started heroin or smoking weed. What I'm ranting and saying here is drugs really do help us and other people to cope with what were feeling and living day to day can sometimes be hard without a xanny or a blaunt in the morning. So fuck everyone and do as you see fit because you gotta live your life the best way possible. Drugs really help people and more need to see that it's TRUE. \n\n\nTLDR: Was depressed so I drank some cough syrup and my aunt caught me now my whole family thinks I'm going to become a drug addict because I smoke weed and drank cough syrup.\n\nEDIT: My aunt just talked to me about it and how it concerned her but she said she didnt want to hide anything because she loves me and wanted me to know.", "author": "GTAssassin10", "score": 13, "flair": "Long Post", "created": 1583010372.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/fbc8zj/my_entire_family_thinks_im_going_to_become_a_drug/", "num_comments": 23, "title": "My entire family thinks I'm going to become a drug addict.", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fj3gczj": {"score": 14, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/fbc8zj/my_entire_family_thinks_im_going_to_become_a_drug/fj3gczj/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1583011496.0, "body": "First of all antidepressants won't do anything unless you take them for a few weeks in a row.\n\nLet them think whatever they want, as long as you have your life under control (basically either you study or you work) they have no say on you.

So 5 and a bit months later I end up taking 11mg of xanax by \"accident\". 2 mg wasn't giving me the desired effects so I took another 2 and took a shot of vanilla extract (it contains ethanol so it would kinda be the same as alcohol i assumed) Anyways I wake up again in a haze and walked to the kitchen where my grandparents were. They were just staring at me with disappointment. I asked them why they were looking at me like that and they explained the situation. The guilt that rushed over me was TERRIBLE. I went to check if I had any xannies left and I had four left so i decided,\" Fuck it, 4mg won't do anything (I know this was stupid but fuck it).: And I was wrong. Unknown to me and my brother, my father and his girlfriend signed us up for a workout course. So for an hour and a half I was running, doing sit ups, those scissor leg things, doing jumping jacks and much much more while I was xanned the fuck out.\n\nSo moral of the story is, DO NOT take xanax. It may be fun but it'll get you in a ton of shit. And half the time you just black out. So to whoever wants to try, I seriously don't recommend. Go smoke some weed or drink robotussin. There's plenty of drugs that won't kill you or get you in shit.\n\nBe safe.

I got a dropper bottle of etiozolam, and I did too much and blacked out. if you look in my history you can find that story.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter that, i tried it once more, maybe 1,5mgs , and threw out the bottle directly after doing it as i didnt feel like losing 2 days again, and i loved the feeling. it made me feel calm, collected, cool and able to hold a conversation with strangers. I felt welcome where i went. it was as if it removed this \"hole\" i constantly have. it made me just....ok, and it had a sense of euphoria (I have anxiety, its managable, but its always present)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course i swore off it, as i had embarrased myself so much in those 2 days i couldnt remember. But it was also empowering. I could physically do these things. none of my friends cut me off, nothing too bad happened. And i missed it. I wanted it again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nso of course, a month after i got another bottle. This was going to be the last time. I got a timed ksafe , that i figured would stop the constant re-dosing. it worked a little the first day, but obviously i broke into it day 2. it had way less of an effect this time, but the amnesia was present. thosse days are a blur and my roommates would constantly reference events i had no recollection of. at some point i fell asleep during a movie and my roommate had tried to slap me and i still didnt wake. That bottle lasted me maybe 5 days. Afterwards, i had forgotten all about it being the last time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthe amnesia was becoming a problem. i liked the euphoria, i liked the social effects, and for some reason i kinda liked how it made me dumber. like ditzy. cute almost. so maybe a week after i decided to get some diazepam, as i knew it was longer lasting, as well as weaker in general. i bought 1 blister of 15 10 mg pills. For some reason, i recieved 3 blisters in the mail. i tried deaddropping 2 of them, and giving out the location on a darkweb forum, but that wasnt allowed so my post was removed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni consumed that blister in one day, as diazepam is not as abusable. it didnt give me that....high i needed. so i went back to my dead drop and got all my diazepam. I smoked weed with it, and i cant exactly remember what happened. I know that my diazepam didnt last very long, maybe 5 days at most. Amnesia was still a real issue now. constantly i was forgetting things, almost burning down the house, always falling asleep at weird times. But it was still just \"a bit of fun\". \"this is just diazepam its not even that bad\"\n\nThen i ordered xanax, 400 mcg of lsd and some oxy. While i was waiting for it to arrive one night it started to hit me what was happening. I was becoming an addict. i couldnt sleep, and i was fearing \"maybe this is what withdrawal is like... maybe im already experiencing i mean...ive done 450 mgs of diazepam in less than a week!\"  \nI couldnt sleep, and i started reaching out to friends, telling them about my fears. i couldnt sleep before 8 am and my dreams were hell, all about dying alone and broke.\n\ni woke up and felt the most refreshed and good in my life.\n\nThen the xanax came in the mail. and well...i did it of course again. The same thing. This was the last time. It was always going to be just the last time.\n\nI had a mdma trip with some close friends and i started talking about my friends about my issues. One good friend bought 10 pills off me, to keep it from me. he left me 5, for the mdma comedown, as well as for the next day.  \n\n\nDay post mdma, im fine. im chillin on the few xannies and weed i have. The day after im dry. I hit up my buddy to get my pills. he says its not a good idea and wont do it. I admit he is right. My weed dealer hits me up, and i go there, to get some weed. I do. Then i decide to go to the shadiest part of town. Where all the junkies hang. Ive passed them before, they always offer you drugs. In my mind, im thinking maybe someone has weed there.  I get offered speed a lot, and dope, but i refuse. Then a man approaches me with the magical words \"xanax?\"\n\nI jump on it. This is the last time. As always. I finish it in one day. 14 1mg pills. one day, and in the end i would say im just feeling drunk.  \n\n\ni do it again. I get scammed one time, but i just take out more money and keep trying untill i get xans. and i go home, and i take them all(not at the same time) over 2 days.  \n\n\nI start messaging my friendsabout these problems, and every single friend is telling me \"you have already told me this several times. We had a whole conversation about it and you said why it was bad to do. You need to stop this. Im really worried about you\". And.....thats when i realized i cant remember most of february to april.....  \n\n\nIm not going to get any more benzos in my life. Maybe if i need to come down for a trip, i'll have one on hand, but...these drugs were nothing like what i was expecting. They creep up on you. They trick you.   \n\n\nI havent had any benzos in maybe...2 days now. I still am not experiencing any withdrawal, and i hope not to. if i do, im going to source some BPC-157 to combat the effects. \n\nI was underestimating this drug under opiates because i figured it was mostly just a sedative, an anti-anxiety medication. But they trick you into becoming a person you dont want to. Ive always said \"this is the last time\", and i really hope i mean it this time. \n\ni dont really know why im writing this all out, i guess i just felt like screaming into the void.\n\nTL;DNR dont do benzos kids lmao", "author": "MisanthropicKitten", "score": 8, "flair": null, "created": 1587059165.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/g2by5x/done_with_benzos_for_good_before_they_make_me/", "num_comments": 12, "title": "done with benzos for good before they make me into something i dont wanna become", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fnklbd1": {"score": 4, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/g2by5x/done_with_benzos_for_good_before_they_make_me/fnklbd1/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1587060226.0, "body": "I relate to this 100%.

For the record, she and I didn't hook up, he'd be mad because she said she wouldn't be staying over but obviously did. I take stock of the situation. We obviously made it back to my place.

We were playing skeeball, we blinked, and then we were waking up at my apartment.\n\nI checked my bank account and we got the McDonald's at 12:30AM, which meant that we couldn't have been at the bar for more than a couple of hours. We both still had our phones, our keys, wallets/purses. We'd brought some other drugs out with us as well and we did a quick inventory and none of that went missing either. Neither of us remember taking a cab back but apparently my friend did call a cab on her phone a little bit before the McDonald's.\n\nWhere things get shitty is that she lost $200 and I lost $100, all in cash. Neither of us can figure out what happened - we didn't spend it on drinks because neither of us felt hungover at all, a cab ride back to my place would've been $20 tops, the McDonald's came out of my debit account.\n\nWhile we were piecing the night together in pursuit of this missing cash my friend proved that her memory was at least *a little* clearer than mine by dropping a couple of knowledge bombs. We were tallying up how much Xanax we'd had before we left my apartment and she chimed in with, \"Oh and we took GHB.\"\n\n... wait, **what?**\n\n\"Yeah dude, we took GHB in shot glasses, mixed with Nudes.\"\n\nI look at the counter. There are two shot glasses sitting there. I open the bottle that I keep the GHB in. It's about the same as before but definitely *a liiiittle* bit less, so we did take some GHB but not very much. I don't remember this **at all**, but okay, surprise number one.\n\nWe continue retracing our steps and we're just before the part where we flag down the pizza guy and my friend chimes in, \"Oh yeah, and then when we decided to take another 1/2 bar.\"\n\n**WAIT WHAT?!**\n\n\"Yeah I said we should take another half bar so we're fully loaded by the time we get into the place and you were like, fuck yeah let's do it.\"\n\nBoth of these new facts happened **before** my latest memory, of playing skeeball, I don't even know how that happens, but at least I know why we blacked the fuck out - a half-bar of xanny that my dealer specifically told me not to take a half-bar of. We've accepted the idea that we're never going to see that cash again, the prevailing theory at the moment is that the cab driver robbed the fuck out of us, but who knows. Maybe our dumb high asses just straight up threw the money into the street.

If you do them I do not recommend using them as you intend (as desired rather than needed) because they are still addictive and they have the worst withdrawal. Like months and months of rebound anxiety and seizures that can kill you. When it comes to drugs like that either use it medically as prescribed or use occasionally as a recreational drug. (as in without structured use, addiction comes with regularity whether it be weekly, monthly, etc.). Once you cross the line from therapeutic to recreational use you can't really go back. You already opened up that mental pathway and it is easier to follow that pathway and harder to keep your use responsible and safe. Using drugs to come out of your shell can only take you so far though so be careful using for those reasons. Acid and shrooms are really cool though, psychedelics are my favorite drugs by far with dissociatives (like Ketamine) coming second, empathogens third (like MDMA), and opioids next. Psychedelics, dissociatives, and empathogens are my favorites though due to long lasting positive psychological changes.

Last summer i abused benzos cause they make me feel so much better. Didn't cause any trouble nor had any crazy blackout episodes. Now my friends won't talk to me.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a 23 years old guy trynna live life. I've been fighting depression and anxiety my whole life. Tinnitus only made things worse. Long story short life's been hard lately and i've got nobody to talk to about this sht.\n\nWeed and alcohol was my sht but i gave up on them cause my paranoia got so crazy to the point where i was having full blown panic attacks.\n\nBeing sober for a year was the best thing i could have ever done. My anxiety got better. I could leave my home without having panic attacks. My agoraphobia got better as well and i remastered some of my long forgotten social skills lol.\n\nLife was good. Summer was close. Finally some time away from college to spend with my friends.\n\nI've been friends with these guys for 5-6 years. Got through so much shit together. We were close af. Having fun. Talking bout everything with each other and making dreams.\n\n\\*I was never against drugs and would never shame them or stop talking to them if they did sht. Which they did. A lot of sht lol. I didn't mind. Even when they abused sht/neglected me for their drugs or drug induced activities. Did it felt good? Nope. I love these guys and i could never stay mad at them for sht like this. They just want to have fun. And that's absolutely fine. We still young. We gon learn. I can't judge em. I was abusing weed daily myself. I'm not perfect.  I've only tried to persuade them to drop weed or to at least stop using daily. Cause shts been changing them.\n\nAnyway sorry for the sidetracking. Back to when my story went downhill.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally summer! Time for my friends, myself and vacations. I've been sober for so long so I'm looking forward to partying and getting fucked up again. Which we did. It was my first time trying MDMA. It was def a magical experience.\n\nFast forward to the end of summer vacations i've got my hands on some benzos.\n\nAnd boy oh boy was my tinnitus gone..\n\nI could just lay in bed for hours enjoying the vast emptiness of my mind that has been running in circles for so many years. It must have been ages since i've last heard silence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Even writing this makes me cry cause i can't stand the constant high pitched sound penetrating my head and the unconscious clinging of my jaw due to anxiety and tension. \\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy boys didn't like the fact that i was using benzos and somewhere around this time i also had a pretty bad experience with them while on MDMA which made me seek professional help.\n\nBoys told me that if i wouldn't  stop using benzos they would stop talking to me. So i stopped.\n\nMy therapist helped me a lot. But i stopped going cause unfortunately therapy is expensive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward Christmas 2019-2020 friends saw an ig story of me flexing some xannies i got my hands on. Yea i know i'm stupid i don't even know why i did that. So they cut me off. Loneliest Christmas of my life.\n\nWe occasionally talk with each other and ask how we've been doin. But sht's not the same and i'm constantly being ghosted. They've called me today to meet but i couldn't at the time and when i called back noone answered again..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know how to handle this situation.\n\nOn one hand i'm so mad at them for treating me this way. I feel like its so hypocritical of them to act like this when they've been abusing so many drugs these years and even treat me like a nobody cause of them (ditching me and sht). Specially when my priorities are my friends even if i'm fucked up. I don't care about bitches or getting my next dose. I just want to have fun with my guys.\n\nBut on the other hand i'm so sad. It's so hard dealing with everything without them. They didn't even bother asking why i was so into benzos. Even when i brought up my tinnitus. I was so proud of myself when i gave up on the pills cause i love my friends. But sht is not easy when i have to deal with so many demons on my own. Of course i'm gonna use again. My mind kills me.

Did i ever tell them that if they don't drop weed and all the damn drugs they've been using i would stop hanging out with them? Fuck no. Cause i fucking love them. Even when they are the ones that have changed and act like complete pricks cause of the damn drugs. Who am I to judge them in such a selfish way.  Do whatever you gotta do to feel better. All i ever told them was that they gotta stop using so often.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been hurt . Ditched and ghosted by my own friends. All for some moments of bliss which i so needed. Now they hang out with people they didn't even know a year back and people they been hatin. This is bs.\n\nSorry for the passive aggressiveness. I love you my dude.

I had trauma, worked through it and made it to a \"healthy\" place that most people are able to get too. And its just that \"one\" thing that they had to survive and heal from. But for me it so many countless things ive lost track. I mean just YEARS of it. Coming, and coming, and coming for years. Ended up believing in my core that I was truly a punk no good piece of shit scum human. By the time I was a Junior in Highscool my plan was to just drop out and use IV until they killed me.\n\nIdk how but after a strong LSD trip I saw something called love, and ended up finding God. I might be \"crazy\" but if you read REAL scripture that isn't isolated from it's context and understand the big message and ENTIRE point of each passage or chapter. It's real man. AND IT IS NOT RELIGION!! I recommend you, one of these next times you take a psychedelic. To honestly in your heart mind and soul, reach out to a \"God\" that you don't even believe in. But, truly sincerely Ask Him to show you that he is real and made you for a REASON. Something will happen. He made you, RELIGION IS FAKE, CONNECT WITH the \"Creator\" not an old man in a chair. But the badass mother fucker who decided make a creature that unlike an animal, we hold the IMAGE of God in US. Psalms says we are gods, NOT God, but gods. When you experience ego death and are at that point of CENTER awareness. YOU. Not you \"yourself\",,,,,, but the YOU that is PERCEIVING it all. The grand center point. Thats what I think it means we are made in the Image of God. We are able to think create and do whatever we want, just quit giving into America and overstimulation of society. We are not seperate from nature. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHeres a quote from a rapper. --- \"Who you worship before they came with the church.\"\n\nForget EVERYTHING you know about \"Christianity\", just pray to Him cause He made you for a reason, and since he made you, once He knows that you ARE seeking for Him, He will provide a way for you to know that He is with you. He made you! ;)", "replies": {}}}}, "g0pfwlv": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/i5ikwd/just_need_some_advice_if_your_willing_thanks_yall/g0pfwlv/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1596853164.0, "body": "L-Tyrosine, from what I understand, helps replenish healthy dopamine levels in your brain so if you use any substance that affects dopamine you should realistically be using L-Tyrosine to help you dopamine homeostasis.

At the risk of detracting from my street cred, I\u2019ll be the first to admit the reality is closer to the opposite, and in a lotta ways, illustrates and exposes the general idiocy and official corruption caused by the drug war.\n\nI\u2019ve never considered myself a \u201cdrug dealer\u201d. By that I mean I was never in possession of large quantities of drugs that I intended to sell for profit. If the cops ever raided my place, the only time they\u2019d discover dugs would be on a plate about to be snorted. Otherwise, I never had a stock set aside for others or the future(i.e. next week). I did \u201cmiddle-man\u201d deals in order to support my own habit, but that was the extent of my kingpin empire. I was never the plug.\n\nDuring the last year preceding my arrest, I did grow close to the actual plug, or, at least, I had thought of us as friends. At the same time, I was partly terrified of him. He was prone to violence, owned a gun illegally, and exhibited incredible pettiness.\n\nFor example, I once arranged for a friend to buy a decent amount of coke from him. Bigs, as I called him, was on his way to deliver the product when my friend backed out. When Bigs arrived, I explained the situation and offered the little money I did have in exchange for some blow, albeit less than originally agreed upon, just so this wouldn\u2019t be a complete waste of his time. Instead, he took the money, struck me in the face, and drove off, leaving me empty-handed.\n\nThat incident should\u2019ve ended our relationship altogether, but in the confused mind of an addict, your dealer often switches from being your best friend to your worst enemy and then back again. He called back days later to apologize but without making any kind of meaningful amends. This established a behavioral pattern that would characterize our relationship: his angry outburst, my non-reaction, his empty apology.\n\nMy fatal mistake was assuming that anyone I showed so much compassion for would never return my kindness with outright malice. So, when he first suggested that I sell some xanax to one of his custos, I didn\u2019t recognize the ploy for what it was. \n\nBigs explained that he had a white guy in Westland to whom I could sell some xanax and cocaine. The first issue was that my xannie supplier no longer had them (or so he told me); I was getting coke from Bigs. The other was that I was getting my shit straight and wanted to cease middle-manning anything. \n\nRegardless, I had no product, no money to buy anything, and no interest to sell anything to this dude. A month or two passed after the initial proposition; nothing happened. Until one day, I returned from my girlfriend\u2019s house to find Bigs waiting at my place, asserting that we\u2019ve got to go meet up with the dude in Westland. When I asked why it was so urgent, he just said, brusquely, that he gave his word and we\u2019d been putting it off for too long. \u201cPlus,\u201d Bigs added, \u201cyou owe me money. You can make a few bucks to pay me back.\u201d\n\n(I really didn\u2019t lose him money. In fact, I had already paid him back, but I was a few days late, because I was in the hospital, having overdosed on drugs he sold me. Since I was there for 3 days, he wanted $30 for each day tardy, so $90 in total. I initially refused and laughed at such a ridiculous demand. He responded by strangling me in my kitchen. His crack head sidekick eventually restrained him with commonsense.)\n\nWhen we arrived at the bar where we were set to meet this dude, we parked and then Bigs handed me the teener in the car as he explained that he gonna make the introduction and lemme handle the entire deal. We walked inside and sat at the bar. While we waited for his \u201ccustomer\u201d, I snuck off to the bathroom to do a few lines from the very same bag I was supposed to sell\u2013a vivid illustration of my ultimate endgame in all this.\n\nAs I came walking back, high as fuck, Bigs was sitting with a square-looking, fat white dude, who ordered us all a shot when I sat down. Bigs then promised this slob I\u2019d be able to hook him up from here out. I was a little nonplussed and taken aback (hadn\u2019t he already been doing business which Bigs? I thought). \n\nWe talked business briefly; some of his comments struck me as incongruent with my understanding of the situation, which was: since he really wanted the xannies, which Bigs did not have access to, at least the amount I did, I\u2019d sell him those as well as coke since I would already be dealing with him. But the xanax seemed like an afterthought to him. Plus, he looked and talked like such a fucking square dork that his only use for coke would be to incentivize the hookers, which he undoubtedly needed as his only sexual outlet, and who, just as assuredly, hesitated at the prospect of sleeping with this poorly put together specimen. But I was too zooted to voice these qualms, or even consider them seriously.\n\nWe quickly exchanged dope for money under the bar, and then departed. Immediately upon getting in the car, I subtly grilled Bigs on how he had met fat Steve. He casually described how another custo introduced them two months ago and had been doing business with him since then. \u201cBut I\u2019m too busy now to drive out here and serve him,\u201d he explained. \u201cI told him we\u2019re only doing large quantities from here on out so you can make a lotta coin for a little work twice a month.\u201d\n\nAbout a week later, that same dude, or \u201cfat Steve\u201d as I had him saved in my phone, hit me up for a lot of coke. $3000 worth to be exact. Bigs already groomed me to expect dealing with larger quantities, so that part didn\u2019t surprise me. What did bother me was that he didn\u2019t even ask about bars, which was ostensibly the reason for my involvement. Now my role seemed superfluous\n\nI replied that I didn\u2019t have that much (or any, for that matter) but Bigs did. He said Bigs said that I\u2019d be able to take care of him no matter what. I didn\u2019t know what he meant by that so I called Bigs to relate what was going on.\n\nI distinctly recall Bigs calling fat Steve a racist for never wanting to spend that much money with \u201cthe black guy\u201d. and then, to my utter surprise, he offered to front the dope, which he rarely did, even with little shit like a half g. Bigs let it slip that he was already in Westland so I suggested that he call up fat Steve so they could arrange to meet for the deal much sooner than I could, which only resulted in an angry nonsensical outburst, ending in his assertion that I had to do it because I still owed him $40, and he promised fat boy that I was, essentially, the man. \n\nHowever, Bigs refused to drive me there, which was disconcerting since he literally escorted me the previous week. Typically, he was straight with driving and reluctant to hand product over without money. To be honest, I felt suspicious of this reversal of behavior and fat Steve\u2019s off key vibe, like a square trying to be a trapezoid. Yet, the looming threat of facing Bigs\u2019 ire overruled these concerns, and I placed my trust that Bigs\u2013someone I had gone out to the bars with plenty of times, introducing him to a bunch of girls and a customer base he\u2019d never have access to without me, someone who was at the strip club with me and some close friends just a few days prior\u2013was not leading me astray, or letting me get blindsided.\n\nAfter an hour or two, he arrived at my place with the shit. As he set it on the scale, the bag weighed out to 55 grams. I immediately scraped off 7 grams, so it came to 48 grams. Bigs stared at me incredulously, as if he didn\u2019t expect me to skim some off the top. He started yelling that I couldn\u2019t fuck this up, that I couldn\u2019t short the sack my first time dealing with him alone. \n\nI was ignorant of the 50 gram laws of the time (because selling drugs wasn\u2019t my occupation), so I stupidly assumed Bigs was trying to introduce some integrity to the proceedings. What he was actually doing was fulfilling his end of the bargain with the authorities by giving them someone on an over 50 charge.\n\nAs he was putting the dope in my hand, Bigs stared me in the eye and threatened that I couldn\u2019t just return with the dope and no cash; I had to bring him back the cash or else he would go to my family\u2019s house and get it from them. I shrugged it off as bluster and didn\u2019t consider it applicable because I planned on going thru with the deal. In retrospect I perceive it as the coercive tactic it was.\n\nNext, he dumped a half gram on a plate for me; I chopped it up quickly, arranged 4 fat rails, and snorted all 4 and crushed a beer within two minutes. This was enough to totally dismiss my misgivings, and ignore my gut instinct insisting something\u2019s amiss. I reassured myself that Bigs would never front me that much dope knowing I wouldn\u2019t actually return with the dough. (Again, this should\u2019ve sounded an alarm bell; he either was getting them from the cops, was getting reimbursed somehow, or could honestly afford to take the loss in exchange for dropping charges.)\n\nI met fat Steve at the same bar, and carried out the transaction in the restroom. When the cops were swarming the building, slamming my head into a table, and arresting the guys who ended up giving me a ride, I couldn\u2019t believe it\u2013and at the same time, knew all along.\n\nThe same guy supplying the drugs was also the confidential informant? Didn\u2019t they realize I was getting drugs from Bigs? As in, they actually believed that this huge 6\u20194 black guy driving fancy cars and no taxable income was copping ounces from a white college grad with little money and a voracious coke habit who had to bum rides to get anywhere outside of the Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti hub? \n\nThey couldn\u2019t, truly, but they certainly pursued and prosecuted the case as if that didn\u2019t seem backwards in all the ways that matter. I used to think stories of corrupt cops working with big time dealers (who feed them low level busts in a manner approximating entrapment) were an urban myth, but I found myself in that exact same predicament. And I can\u2019t help but feel that this is standard operating procedure for law enforcement, especially local police departments, whose budgets and paychecks are bolstered by the existence of a public drug problem, and who devote 5x more personnel to narcotics than to homicide and rape. \n\nI can\u2019t say with certainty whether the Westland cops were working with Bigs, a high-level dealer with an extensive criminal history, due to corruption or incompetence, and I still don\u2019t know which would be worse (and more terrifying).\n\nwww.easy-trouble.com", "author": "easytrouble92", "score": 1, "flair": "In memoriam", "created": 1601770927.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/j4hvxt/country_road_with_rick_ross/", "num_comments": 3, "title": "Country Road with Rick Ross", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"g7izksj": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/j4hvxt/country_road_with_rick_ross/g7izksj/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1601771960.0, "body": "as biggie would say never get high on your own supply.

I'm not saying I agree with him, but it's interesting and I'm certainly saving half a pill to test this out on later, as I've religiously never snorted benzos. But tell me what you all think. It's an interesting read. Here it is:\n\n\" We've all seen it. It's littered throughout Bluelight, Reddit, and everywhere else on the web. It's the myth that insufflation as a route of administration for benzodiazepines is ineffective, has a low bio-availability, and in other words \"is a waste of our pills\".\n\nAccording to actual research, AKA lab drug studies, the insufflation bio-availability of midazolam has been show to be good, if not great. Due to it being one of the more popular of only a few studies in this subject matter, it has built a reputation as the only benzodiazepine with a good intranasal BA. Unfortunately, this has led to the dissemination of false information regarding BA, and the rumor that benzodiazepines, since not water-soluble, can't be snorted.\n\nFirst off, let me just negate the latter claim about water-solubility. You wouldn't be able to sublingual your xanny bar if 'water-solubility' played any role in the bodies ability to absorb a substance. That claim is simply *fake news*. *Sad.*\n\nBeyond that, BA for insufflation use of diazepam, temazepam, and lorazepam has been shown throughout intranasal use studies as being nearly as high, if not the same to oral BA (usually within \\~10%). [For example](https://ic.ucsc.edu/~drsmith/metx270/html/Case2%20Grp1%20paper.pdf); lorazepam has been shown to have a nasal BA of around 77%. According to another study, the average BA orally for lorazepam, among test subjects, was also 77%.\n\nPersonally, I've snorted Klonopin, Ativan, Restoril, and Valium. I'd never insufflate alprazolam, I'd rather sublingual that bitter taste than cover my nasal cavity in it. Restoril (temazepam) was/is *VERY* effective and came on strong within \\~20 seconds. It's what sparked my research session. I snort around half of my prescribed dosage, each and every day. I had to debunk this stupid shit, based on research, instead of my own experience.\n\nFrom what I've found in my \\~6 hours of digging around the internet and actually doing my research, diazepam, temazepam, lorazepam, and midazolam are among the only benzodiazepines studied for this route of administration. This is due to it having low medical application potential, asides from dosing seizing patients. A lack of information about other benzodiazepine's intranasal bio-availability **never** is simply grounds for ruling out the possible success of it for intranasal use. Nor does it imply all other benzodiazepines have low insufflation BAs. If we were to look at the benzodiazepine class as a whole, and the large number of properties each shares, the majority hypothetically should share the same BA potential.\n\n**TLDR;** *Break out the credit cards and dollar bills. Time to partake in snorting the coke of downers.* This is a scientifically-based opinion piece.\n\n*If* you'd like to counter this debate; go do research into some legitimate primary sources, and speak your piece.\"", "author": "DavenportMorality", "score": 5, "flair": null, "created": 1576223713.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/e9vux2/opinions_on_this_piece_defending_nasal_ba_of/", "num_comments": 0, "title": "Opinions on this piece?

In these two years I've gotten to meet a few life long friends and more importantly my soon to be wife. In this time I have also have gotten a few connection I had never tried before including; xanax, valium, alcohol, adderall, acid (1 trip before back in aus), shrooms and unfortunately nicotine lol.\n\nYes all those drugs I have mentioned have been nothing but great experiences the best part was who I was with and how I spent my time with those drugs.\n\nI could go on and on about the times I've had as they were all special experiences but to keep it brief I've had a really nice moments in the beggining of 2018 and the last two weeks of my life actually!\n\nBut before I go onto the memorable moments I've had recently to describe my time in Michigan I'd say it was nothing but an amazing time. Shit that's where I tried all those drugs. I've had quite a few solo trips or shroom vibing but a lot of that time even then was spent on discord who I have spent time with for many years. Getting wacked and gaming having a good laugh the whole time. And if I wasn't doing that I was using those drugs with the new friends I hade made in this new state.\n\nWhen I first Moved to Michigan I had a friend that was extremely hyped to come and visit me. He lives in NC and we have been playing video games for 7 years. He drove up to meet me one week after be there and then I spent one week in NC and it was an amaizng time. Smoked a lot weed, tripped on acid and bought some vyvanse and got sold some addys at a gas station in Detroit was sick. Meeting someone who you have known for so long was a crazy experience having the connection and experience we had.\n\nAbout a week and a half before my flight I had another friend who I was playing games with for about 5 years come visit me at my house and that was an awesome time too. We did a lot of shit showed him around the city and just vibed hard.\n\nThe day of my flight after I flew from Detroit to LAX I met up with another friend who I have been friends with since 7th grade back in Cali, I'm 20 now. He drove 2 hours from his city to come see me for about an hour and a half during my layaway and smoked me the fuck out on some fire cali kush. Then gave me an edible for my 14 hour flight and I slept for 10 hours, the best long flight I've ever had. Was such a cool brief vibe but something that was so stimulating seeing someone who you haven't seen for such a long time since you've moved away for quite a while. We played games everyday since 7th grade, till this day.\n\nNow that I'm back in Australia and off my international quaratine I get to sneak a couple visits at the crib. Doing my best to respect social distancing and only hanging out with my close friend I made while I was here before I moved back to the states. He's been able to come over a slim amount of times and has been provided more then a half ounce kush, a few xannies and a cap which was my first time MDMA experience. I'm looking forward to more of the times I get to spend with my homie!\n\nAnyway sorry for the rant but I'm just wondering what have been some of your favorite or even simmilar drug experiences you've had with the people close to you?
