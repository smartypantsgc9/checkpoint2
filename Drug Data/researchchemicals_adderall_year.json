{"fcone5": {"text": "To preface this, I should mention that I really love stimulants, amphetamines in particular. I have a naturally high tolerance to them, and can handle rather unhealthy amounts of them. For reference a single 30mg adderall taken intranasally doesn't feel that strong to me, and will mostly have the effect of making me crave more. For me the lines blur between \"functional\" and \"recreational\" when it comes to amphetamines, which is why I love them so. I enjoy the fact that I can be very high and experiencing significant euphoria, while also still being able to socialize, complete tasks, and pass as sober to society at large. I fell in love with prescription amphetamine pretty much instantly, so the prospect of an RC that is far cheaper, easily available, and just as good (or even almost as good) was very appealing. As a result I have taken many of them. I will be comparing them to amphetamine mostly, so you can consider that the \"control\" to for all these RCs. I take something for the comedown anytime I take a stimulant. I often also take these long before I come down to smooth it out. My go to is phenibut, but I also use and have used kratom, hydrocodone, 1,4-BDO, CBD, and some RC benzos for this purpose. I have pretty rough comedowns because I tend to take a lot, and I also redose to stay high for a whole day when I take stims. I also wait at least a week between my \"speed days\" and at most I allow myself to take them two days in a row, never more. So I typically am going into the experience with either no tolerance or a rather low tolerance. My habits of usage certainly play a role in how the drugs affect me, so keep that in mind. I will rank each one at the end of its review.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2-FA:** This one is by far the closest RC to Amphetamine in my experience. A 30mg oral dose of 2-FA nearly the same as a 30mg Adderall IR to me, as far as mood lift, stimulation, and side effects. The duration is pretty similar as well. I think Amphetamine is capable of inducing somewhat more euphoria at higher doses, but the difference is rather small. 2-FA still has good euphoria if the proper dose is taken, but its ability as a consistent mood booster is as good as standard amphetamine. In my seasoned opinion, this is the gold standard of functional RC stims, and it is good enough to totally replace expensive RX stims. I think that 2-FA may have a slightly milder comedown compared against the control, but like most of it's qualities it's far more similar than it is different. Great mood boost and stimulation without being too distracting. It is everything that I thought 2-FMA would be, which is an Adderall clone. It is pretty terrible to snort, and it doesn't vape. This one is best oral, but also works very well plugged. I don't have a ton to say about this one, because it's very similar to amphetamine in every regard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2-FMA:** This one was a huge disappointment for me. I was really just hoping it would be even half as good as RX amphetamines, but it just wasn't. People were right when they said it is very functional and has low abuse potential, but that's only because it lacks any significant mood boost/euphoria. Everything was there, the strong stimulation, the focus, muscle tension, the long duration, everything except the enjoyment. It feels like amphetamine with all the pleasure stripped away. It didn't necessarily make me feel bad, but I didn't feel good either. It basically made me feel apathetic and robotic. Even if I was very awake and could focus, I didn't really give a shit about anything. For me amphetamine is useful not just because it helps me focus, but because it gives me a fantastic mood that makes tasks so much more interesting and engaging. Therefore, making me productive. For this reason, 2-FMA was pretty much useless for me. Feeling like a robot who is only compelled to do things by joyless stimulation kind of sucks.\n\nThe only application I could imagine for this drug would be in combinations with other drugs that are enjoyable on their own, but would benefit from a bit of stimulation. At least the potency and duration were rather high. This is by far my least favorite RC amphetamine, it actually really confuses me that people recommend this drug so much, but perhaps I'm to fixated on pleasure to appreciate this as the tool that it is to some people. An amphetamine without pleasure is like an opiod that dulls pain but doesn't have euphoria, what's the point?  At one point, I put some in a bowl of weed, and I think it worked partially. I refuse to get this one again to give a proper vape trial as I would have to pay for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3-FMA:** This one is weird. It honestly does feel somewhat like a midway point between 2-FMA and 4-FMA. The first thing that I noticed about it was how potent it is. I vaporized 30 milligrams, and it felt like I was just coming up on 60mgs of adderall. I found it to be significantly more potent and longer lasting than amphetamine, especially when taken orally. It is also unique in the fact that it vapes nicely. It is pretty euphoric as well, in the ballpark of adderall, maybe a little more intense. When I get really high on speed I get to a point where it's difficult to not rapidly form ideas, either by talking to people, writing, or just basically forming a complex dialogue in my own head. I get to that state VERY QUICKLY with this stuff. It's weird because it can serve the role of a functional drug well enough, but it's definitely not ideal for it. It just skips the stage of being pleasantly stimulated and focused, and goes straight to what is basically a state of controlled mania.\n\nI'm not sure if it does have any effect on serotonin, but if it does it certainly releases far less then 4-FMA. It also seems to be a little on the edgier side, it caused jitteryness and a feeling of over stimulation more than its peers. In general, I think the amphetamines with a methyl group tend to be a little more potent, but are also a little heavier in the undesirable side effects. I found myself needing a little kratom or phenibut to smooth this one out. This one isn't my favorite, but its impressive potency and duration give you a lot of bang for your buck. The fact that you can vape it is also very nice. The powder was mostly small rocks, and it smelled really chemically in an unpleasant way, so I assumed it would be nasty. However, upon vaping it off foil I realized that it had a very mild taste, kind of like a fake sweetener, and didn't burn my lungs at all. It vaporizes even a little bit better than 3-FPM, at least for the batch I got. This one is worth giving a try for amphetamine lovers who enjoy being perhaps a little too blasted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4-FMA:** This one is really rather euphoric. It definitely releases some serotonin, but not enough to make it a proper empathogen. It also releases to much to really be a functional stimulant either. This one is kind of just in a stimulant limbo. On one occasion, I did take it at work in a succession of smaller doses. It got me through my shift with no sleep, but it took a toll on me. It's very good for socializing, especially informally with friends, but it's a little too rolly to be good for focusing or studying. It's also not even as complete of a roll as say 3-MMC. I found that it was a little less potent than amphetamine, and also had a worse comedown. In general, it seems to be a bit harsher on the body and mind, probably in part due to serotonin release. It's not really a terrible drug, it's just right in-between two roles, neither of which it can satisfactorily fulfill. This one would probably be best for recreational activities where you want plenty of euphoria and stimulation without dedicating to an actual roll. It's not the worse stimulant I've tried for sure, but if you've got other options go with those.  It seems like this is just a shittier version of 4-FA, a drug that was able to fit into two roles far better. The second worse one I've tried.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3-FEA:** This is the only one in this list that I would consider to be a true empathogen. This is possibly the most unique amphetamine that I have tried, because it is by far the least stimulating. When you take an empathogen like MDMA, there is some level of relaxation mixed with the stimulation due to the serotonin release. It's pretty subtle with a drug like MDMA, but its like 3-FEA takes that kind of serotoninergic chill, and presents it in its pure form, without the in your face stimulation. It almost seems as if it's amphetamine, but with most of the dopamine and norepinephrine replaced by serotonin. It's the only amphetamine I have taken that didn't compel me to constantly move. The dosages for this one were very high, but even at very high doses there wasn't a whole lot of muscle tension or stimulation. At a certain dose level (I don't remember what it was, but it was high) it did become a true roll in my opinion, just the most relaxing roll ever. It actually was a little trippy at that point. Unlike 4-FMA, where even when you took a lot you never felt like you were even close to rolling. The weird part was that at doses below the threshold of rolling, it was literally just a relaxing amphetamine. It felt like speed, just instead of that pushy energetic rush, there was a calm sense of well being and chill. I felt more social, but instead of it being driven by stimulation it was driven by a feeling of openness and calm.\n\nDue to its rolly nature, this one is probably not good to take as frequently as standard amphetamines, but it is really nice and worth trying. Some people characterized this drug as being a useless in-between like 4-FMA, but it's far more interesting and fun than that. I personally found the comedown to be a lot more tolerable than drugs like 6-APB or MDMA. It was about as bad as an amphetamine comedown, just different. Instead of acute mental and physical discomfort, it took the form of a gradual transition out of the high and into a feeling similar to how you feel about a day after a strong MDMA roll, emotionally drained. This drug is super unique, if you like entactogens this one is worth trying, if nothing else but for the novelty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3-FPM:** I know this isn't technically an amphetamine, but it's pretty similar and it's got a flourine on it. Plus I want to talk about this one. This is one of two stimulants I have vaped. Because of this, it is elevated to a higher status for me. Especially since this drug is fucking painful to sniff, even more so than most of the previously mentioned drugs; all of which, besides pharma amphetamine, are pretty awful to snort. I think what I like the most about 3-FPM is that is has less unpleasant side effects than any other drug on this list overall. I can sleep more quickly, eat more easily, clench my jaw less, and have considerably more tolerable comedowns. One might assume that this is a trade off for euphoria, but I disagree (sort of). For me, 3-FPM can have euphoria as good as amphetamine, it just doesn't last as long. It has a short window of real pleasure, and then the majority of the rest of the high is just okay. Oral amphetamine has 3 to 4 hours of the actually really good peak effects, where 3-FPM has one, even though I feel like the total duration of 3-FPM is roughly the same. As a result of this, it lends itself to continual dosing, which is why vaporization is my favorite ROA for this one. It's really easy to just vape a bit of it every half hour or so and just keep a nice high going. It's strange though. You want to redose to get back the euphoria, but you don't actually start coming down until a few hours after you start craving. So it can be insanely fiendish, but if you're occupied you can kind of just ignore it for a little bit, as opposed to something like coke.\n\nIt's also far less potent that amphetamine, probably about half as strong. The lower potency combined with the extremely forgiving nature of this stim means that even when you're using a ridiculous amount of the stuff during a binge it never fucks with you as much as you feel like it should. For these reasons, it's a pretty good functional drug (as long as you're using ROA's other than vaped), second to 2-FA as far as RCs go for me, but it's also a pretty decent recreational drug. It's super fun to vape a ton of it with some friends because you can enjoy that satisfaction of overindulgence without paying the price that less friendly stims will charge (shit like hexen for example). I have a feeling that 3-FPM has far less of an effect on adrenaline than most amphetamines, while still releasing a good amount of dopamine. The high is really smooth and clean and doesn't have much edginess to it. It's not like a serotonergic kind of smoothness either, it's like a purified dopamine high. This one is one of my favorite stims, simply because it's so light, yet it still has that nice energetic euphoria. I blow through this drug so quickly when I have it though. It's ironic that the lightest stim on this list is also the most compulsive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis list has all of the ones I've tried so far. I know this list is missing 3-FA, 4-FA, and 4-FEA. I would love to try the first two, although it wouldn't surprise me if 4-FA is pretty much extinct to Americans. From what I hear, 4-FEA is an even less potent version of 3-FEA, which sounds pretty useless, so I doubt I'll try it. I hope someone can get something of value from this 3-FMA fueled monstrosity, my apologies for this wall o' text.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited for grammar and sanity.", "author": "colorfulexistance", "score": 255, "flair": null, "created": 1583235805.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/fcone5/my_reviews_on_all_of_the_flourinated_amphetamines/", "num_comments": 111, "title": "My Reviews On All of The Flourinated Amphetamines I've Tried", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fjc3rrp": {"score": 45, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/fcone5/my_reviews_on_all_of_the_flourinated_amphetamines/fjc3rrp/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1583236662.0, "body": "Good read.

Makes you look and act like a crackhead tho. Super compulsive AND super addictive, probably the one drug that makes me think about it a bit too concerningly often. \n\nSurprisingly little to no comedown too. \n\n**4F-MPH:** It's everything about ritalin but turned 120% up. Currently on it for the first time. Slaps.\n\n**Methylphenidate:** Amazing stim, gives me smooth euphoria throughout the day. Sometimes makes me tweak a bit but it's great for anything productive while being fun as shit. \n\nDoesn't make me feel like im high on drugs, just makes me a better and happier me. Its expensive though and the comedown **sucks** so i don't use it often. \n\nDefinitely something i should watch out with 4f though, its cheap asf and easy to get in large amounts. \n\n**Caffeine:** been addicted to this since i was 13 lol. If i take a 2 week tolerance break it literally gives me euphoria. Isn't unhealthy. It's socially acceptable. Makes me function very well. It's not something too special but it has a place in my heart. \n\nAlso coffee in most forms tastes delicious. \n\n**Armodafinil/modafinil:** used it for a while to be productive. It worked well. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\nHas no comedown and feels healthier than other stims so I'm ranking it higher. \n\n**Methamphetamine:** Did it once so i don't have much to say here. Good euphoria but a whole week of comedown + those redose cravings is no bueno for me. \n\n**Amphetamine:** Makes me feel great if its good but most street speed is cut to hell and gives me a lot of anxiety. If it's pharma adderall, i like it a lot. Not much experience with it though. If i got access to pharmacy stims I'm going for the ritalin \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\n**2-FMA:** Pretty nice stim, has a little bit of euphoria and makes me productive. Nearly no comedown. It gives me more anxiety than i want and my heart rate JUMPS waaaaay more than other stims. Feels really unhealthy in that regard. \n\n**1-ethyl-theobromine:** Synthesised with a friend of mine from theobromine as a fun lil experiment. Used a caffeine synth but replaced the methyl iodide with ethyl iodide. Worked well and had a melting point matching the literature. \n\nI took some. Felt like a really strong coffee. Lasted shorter. Was a nice lil experience. Uh. That's all. \n\n**_From here onwards they're all garbage imo_**\n\n**Flmodafinil:** It's a lot like modafinil but makes me an anxious mess. I'll pass. \n\n**Theobromine:** eating a bar of dark chocolate for breakfast after a coffee tolerance break just made me unable to sleep with no other discernible effects. The definition of meh. \n\n**Theacrine:** useless, no effects. \n\n**IPPH:** made me feel like shit and annoyed at everything. No stimulation, no anything else. Just annoying edgyness.

This is rather a newer understanding from what I gather. Amphetamines entering synaptic vesicles through VMAT-2 collapse the pH gradient between cytosol and synaptic vesicle which allows monoamines to exit the synaptic vesicle into the cytosol. (More availability for efflux caused by TAAR-1).\n\nMonoamine transporters themselves (DAT, SERT, and NET themselves rather than VMAT) are co-localized with TAAR-1 receptors throughout the brain, and when amphetamines are taken up through monoamine transporters they activate TAAR-1 causing transporter phosphorylation which reverses the transporter and causes efflux of the relevant associated monoamine. (Of which more are available from VMAT)\n\nObviously this effect will be more pronounced at dopaminergic neurons, as the affinity for uptake through DAT is higher than SERT, unless dopamine or norepinephrine transporters are co-localalized with SERT. I don't have extensive knowledge of how often this occurs but I know there are instances of DA/5-HT co-localalization.\n\nI'm no biochemist but all of this taken together seems to me to suggest a potential for a non-negligible effect (1.7 mM isn't strong but it isn't nothing).\n\nYou could be correct, and maybe the differences have more to do with increased cAMP through TAAR-1 activation. I had kind of forgot that TAAR-1 was inside the terminal and thus needs to actually be taken through the relevant transporter to act as a releasing agent rather than just indiscriminately blasting all monoamines.\n\nAlso just a side note, I understand TAAR's association with amphetamine is a relatively recent understanding (last decade or so) of amphetamines' MOA, whereas previously it was thought that it was simple competitive reuptake inhibition via the fact that amphetamines had affinity for DAT/NET.

If you have only 3MMC as reference point then the taking 4MMC won't all of a sudden make (quality) 3MMC totally worthless as many people seem to suggest (not you, you've phrased it suggestive in a positive way) But many times i see no mention of the fact that even though 4MMC have significant better euphoria, it comes with it downsides as well for the SERT affinity. So I might agree that 3MMC is even a better 'stimulant' then 4MMC which i feel belongs under the pure entactogens. Personally there both far to recreational to be of any productive kind for me, but 3MMC has imo a little stronger aphrodisiac effects and much less of a sudden crash. Which in turn makes it a lot less fiendish then 4MMC... again in my opionion.\nBut all that being said: quality 4MMC is an amazing compound\n\n2. Not everybody has easy access to REAL and quality 4MMC these days since its pretty much global ban. So if you get it test it to be sure, as many times people get sold other cathinones or mixes there off being sold as 4MMC (65:35 3mmc/4emc is a common example i find) furthermore it depends where you live of course.. in my county the Netherlands its still readily available as is 4FA. But 100km south when in Belgium i have only ever run in to fake mixes (just as an example, nothing against Belgium)\n\nTo OP: great post, you've clearly found 4f-MPH which is a great substance. But my advise keep your usage minimal as its very addictive productive stimulant, but loses its euphoric aspect quickly if used to often and then the side effects become more prominent.

The entity said none of this matters anyway and you will forget everything when you go back to Earth. After that, the nitrous wore off and it had only been about 30 seconds since I first took the nitrous. It felt like I spent a thousand years listening to this entity and was so disappointed that I couldn't remember the story of the Universe when I came back to Earth. All I  can remember is exactly what I wrote in this comment but it was still a very enlightening experience. I've tried MDMA and nitrous a few other times and it has given me more answers about the universe than any other drug I've tried. I felt like I was a thought and an object at the same time, like I was transforming between energy and matter. This is something everyone should try, nitrous is very safe too.

I kept getting my mind blown every time I took the no2, kept saying I figured everything out and it turned into a joke in the end because after every hit I took, I would remember that I was going to forget everything and then I realised I kept forgetting everything because the information I was receiving was meant to be kept a secret as I was unable to speak out loud the ideas I was getting. Eventually I managed to pull some information out, writing down things as well but I don't know if I remembered this 'secret'. I figured out that I was merely a thought travelling through still frames of reality and that time was created by travelling through these still frames one by one like a digital video. It looks like a lag effect. Every frame of reality exists at once in the Universe; past, present and future. The Universe is like a finshed film and time is the illusion of movement created by travelling through these still frames of the film one by one, from start to finish. I also figured out that our conscious is nothing but a chain of thoughts and memories, a chain of moments of reality. Every thought connects with a unique reality or dimension. Our thoughts mirrors our environment and we are moulded by the thoughts and moments we remember. We can change who we are by changing our thoughts and memories. I had contradictory thoughts all the time too. I remember being a thought and the environment at the same time, kinda like the quantum cat theory, I felt like I was alive and dead at the same time as well. I eventually realised that everything in the Universe exists on a spectrum and that the world isn't black or white. We are a mix of two opposites which means I could be 90% alive and 10% dead and that makes me healthy and energetic or I could be 60% alive and 40% dead which makes me sick and have no energy. Gender is mixed too and defined by masculine and feminine energies. I could be 80% masculine and 20% feminine which makes me a man or I could be 45% masculine and 55% feminine which makes me a tomboy. 90% feminine and 10% masculine would likely make me a girly girl. We are all a mix of light and dark energy, good and bad, yin and yang. The spectrum theory really helps me understand why the world works the way it does. One other thing I remember as well is that I felt like I had no control over the thoughts I was having, it felt like my mind was mirroring the environment and it was the environment that was in control of my thoughts. For example, if I wanted to take another hit of the No2, it was the energy of the No2 itself that gave me the thoughts to huff it. If I wanted to eat a burger for dinner, it was the collective energy of the burger that gave me the thoughts to want to eat one. It's like all matter has a purpose and we get thoughts based on the environments energy and purpose. This has led me to start to believing that everything in the Universe is consciousness and I'm now experimenting with the idea that the conscious environment controls the everyday thoughts that you have. MDMA and No2 together is truly a powerful experience and I've always had mind blowing trips every time. Who knows what I'll find out next, what do you think of the information I got out of this mix?\nI've never had experiences this mind blowing before.", "replies": {"fiyec40": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/f9f7hs/my_research_chemical_and_drug_review_compilation/fiyec40/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1582866568.0, "body": "Consciousness is energy and the universe is an ocean of energy.

Either way it's reckless.", "replies": {}}}}}}}}, "eqi6nb": {"text": "I've tried to review it twice and never really had enough perspective so here's my true take on it:\n\n\n\nIt has no percievable recreational effects of any kind and if you try to get them it becomes extremely jittery and makes your whole body hurt. \n\n\nIt doesnt act as an effective appetite suppressant. \n\n\nIt does not increase motivation. \n\n\nIt kills libido entirely. (For you stim fap fiends. Seriously. Nothing. Nada. Not even a wiggle) \n\n\nWhen you do manage to feel stimulated its all physical and you just want to pace around but youre scatterbrained and nothing is interesting, and you dont feel good. Like a cup of coffee is easily twice as euphoric.\n\n\n\nYou will still compulsively redose because somehow it has a crash despite not having a high. And it has a short duration so you at least feel content with the awful side effects one second, then the next second your mood drops and you just feel uncomfortable. \n\n\n\nThe only ROAs that work well are vaped and oral. \n\n\n\nIm sitting here two days later after going through only 200mg and I still feel like it's affecting me. Im anxious and my chest hurts and I randomly feel jittery. \n\n\nI smoked weed last night and was on the verge of a panic attack and it just felt like something was wrong I actually got quite stimulated and couldnt stop bouncing my leg. This was the day after having taken it. Im a daily smoker and was barely high.\n\nAnywho back to morphodrol, just thought that was weird.\n\n\nThe first dose I tried made my body really warm and it wasnt euphoric but it was somewhat relaxing and it never did that again so Im scared it has serotonin action and I fried my brain for the time being. I feel dissociated.\n\n\nThe very, very slight benefits last 1.5 hours tops and the side effects last like 3-4. \n\n\n\nMy visual accuity is lower than normal. \n\n\nI took kratom 3 days in a row and benzos 2 nights in a row (use both very sparingly) so Im really praying this is just all 3 things combined, but Ive done those latter 2 in a more abusive manner before and Ive never felt like this. \n\n\nHere was doses and rate of use:\n\n\nWednesday 2-3mg allergy test at 2pm\n\n10mg nasally at 5\n\n10mg nasally at 5:30 or so \n\n10mg nasally maybe an hour later\n\n\n5mg vaped every here and there until ten when I was finally able to force myself to stop. \n\n\n5g kratom is taken now, along with 150ug flualprazolam and then 1mg bromazolam because I was scared to redose more flap. \n\n\n\nWake up on thursday. Feel out of it and unmotivated and dont wanna move. \n\n\nTry 20mg orally. Finally actually works and I gain the ability to move and not feel like just laying in bed. I become impressed and start telling people its actually decent. In an hour I have to redose after I start feeling gross. \n\n\nRepeat all day ad nauseum, the physical tension increasing with every dose. \n\nThat night I take a boatload of kratom and upwards of 2mg of bromazolam. \n\n\nThen on friday, I took kratom in the morning along with L-tyrosine and 5-htp and a little coffee and some weed later on. \n\nFeel weird most of the day but also high and fuzzy and the bromazolam from the night before was still doing stuff most of the day so not that awful. \n\n\n\nSleep all night with bizarre dreams. \n\n\n\nHere I am today. Sober minus tyrosine and 5htp. \n\nI feel like I did a gram of molly last night. Maybe even worse. Not as depressed, but somehow its still worse.  I feel really scared I fucked up by consuming this bullshit. \n\n\nKratom and two nights of benzos should not have me feeling this way. \n\n\n\nDont take this drug please there is no point. Im almost considering getting banned from the vendor selling it by just saying how awful it is and to please stop selling it. \n\n\nI dont even have the mental power or energy to organize this post better I know it doesnt read well or make total sense in the way I wrote it.\n\n\nPlease be safe. Im never touching a brand new drug again. I have a very strong feeling this shit has some weird mechanisms of action and isnt just a reuptake inhibitor as suspected.\n\n#edits and updates:\n\n\nPS.\nIf you took a decent sized hit for your first dose it might be euphoric actually, but itll end after a minute and youre gonna have a shitty rest of the day.\n\n\nEdit: I tried slowly sipping a coffee and Im getting chest pains and jitters after only half of it. I normally have 400+mg caffeine per day. Again, 36 hours or so since my last dose. I shouldnt still have residual side effects if I do say so myself. Im laying down and shaking sort of. If I try to gently rest my top and bottom teeth together they chatter.\n\nI shouldve just bought fucking cocaine when I was craving stims. This has become a way bigger ordeal. I got shit to do and no drive to do it. It wouldve only been $10 extra too \ud83d\ude02\n\nEdit: Can someone smart please hypothesize wtf this did to my brain Im soooo fucking jittery and tense and getting sharp pains from the smallest amount of coffee\n\nIm kind of thankful this happened because I was starting to dislike life and kept craving a reckless bender and now I feel like getting my life in order\n\nAlso oddly enough the coffee is strangely mood lifting today despite the way lower than normal dose.\n\nI swear to goodness there has been some lasting change to the way my dopamine and norepinephrine systems are working. (I know it wont be permanent, I just mean theres some bizarre longer duration thing going on. Im tense and hyper focused like Im on adderall. Not complaining about that part)\n\n\n\nOkay hopefully last edit: I figured it out. It is cocaine that only works on your subconscious mind. The dopamine never makes it to the percievable part of your brain. You are doing crack and cant feel it basically.\n\nSo if youd like to have all the side effects of crack cocaine without that pesky euphoric high- Try vaping morphodrol!\n\nOne user even blew through 500mg in a night! (Poor guy, I cringe as I remember reading that report)\n\n\nOkay last one for real: That awkward moment when youve used every drug class to mask the side effects of other drug classes so now you have to be sober and uncomfortable because youll make it worse doing anything else\n\nEdit later at night: Im fucking fried and Im really scared. So much anxiety, hearts beating so hard, every single aspect of my body is uncomfortable, and Im having weird visual distortions like HPPD but worse. I can look at anything for more than five seconds before it starts moving around and warping and messing with me\n\n\n30 mins later: Started feeling warm and giggling like crazy at the show Im watching. \n\n\nWhat the fuck is happening to me\n\nIm scared to even take velerian root\n\nIm trying weed in literally 3mg increments or so.\n\n\n\nSunday: Feel a lot better. Might even be fine after I have some coffee and get rid of these caffeine withdrawals. I dont understand what happened or why it happened but Im glad to have 30mg left so that I can look at it in my stash and remind myself to be smarter for years to come. \n\nIm glad I had a bad experience", "author": "fluffedpillows", "score": 24, "flair": null, "created": 1579392518.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/eqi6nb/dont_touch_morphodrol_morphodrol_review/", "num_comments": 62, "title": "Don't touch morphodrol.

Do you enjoy them or have experience with different types?\n\nAfter looking at the structure I would speculate that it is definitely acting as a monoamine reuptake inhibitor (like methylphenidate) rather than a releaser (like amphetamines) since it's too bulky to be a substrate for DAT/NAT/SERT.  I have fairly extensive experience with many different stimulants but I only really enjoy releaser-type stimulants such as amps.  The effects you describe are what I typically get from reuptake inhibitors such as methylphenidate and related compounds despite the fact that I enjoy stimulants very much.\n\nIt's pretty well documented in the medical literature that there is significant inter-individual variability in whether patients respond to amphetamines or reuptake inhibitors.  Often times one class will produce desirable effects while the other produces mostly adverse effects.  Despite amphetamines, phenidates, and pyrovalerone-cathinones all being 'stimulants' they produce their effects very differently and effect dopaminergic transmission differently in key brain areas.\n\nI personally don't really enjoy phenidates (or even cocaine that much any more) since they typically just make me anxious, physically stimulated and vaguely dysphoric after the initial rush with little in the way of useful effects.  The point I'm trying to make is that it may just be that the class of drug doesn't agree with you while others may be able to get desirable effects.\n\nSorry for the rambling reply and thanks for posting your experience, it's given me some good food for thought.

I haven\u2019t taken a stim for around 2 weeks so my tolerance is basically zero right now. \n\nAlso, for a time reference, I eneded up taking the 3-FA at 5:30 PM\n\n-0:30: I took 2400mg fish oil, 400mg CoQ10, 420mg magnesium citrate, 1 grams of arjuna, and 3 grams of l-arginine for harm reduction purposes and vasoconstriction. \n\n+0:00: consumed a cap filled with 70mg of 3-FA. \n\n+0:30 definitely starting to feel it, 3-FA gives me a wonderful tingly sensation that adderall and vyvanse give me. 2-FA, 2-FMA, and 4F-MPH do not give me this feeling, which frankly is one of my favorite parts. \n\n+1:07: I have passed the come up phase and am feeling pretty good rn. Heart rate is 71 BPM which is great to see. \n\n+2:01 i definitely feel like I am peaking or close to it. 3-FA blows 2-FA out of the water in terms of euphoria. But not to much euphoria to handle, because I can still focus extremely well on my studies. Heart rate is 73 BPM.\n\n+5:00 There is not much to add, I basically sat at my computer this whole time working on arbitrary assignments and projects for school. \n\n+6:00 getting that stim headache right about now. Bot coming down to hard yet\n\n+7:15: I finish up the last of my school work and decided it\u2019s definitely time to go to bed. (Its 12:45 AM at this point).

Apologies if this 3the wrong place for questions but I couldn't figure out hor to start my own thread with my 2 questions.  I hope for just honest feedback as it is important to my research. 1. I've developed a benzo(flu-alprazolsm) I know I'm an idiot so I don't need to be told I'm stupid.  But I first noticed with dmt , real dmt that is made locally,  just order the  bark from S. America.  I used to get super high ,  cover my head with a blanket do no light would get in and see and feel in awesome.  And with the flap addiction I only get the body high and no visuals in me hesd. 2. 2nd question I never did meth and adderall was a  it much because I was getting it in powder form so not having a mg. scale I may have dont little to much and I work so I need my sleep at night. So I've been using 3-fpm on and off for 8 months or so . It was fine at first  but I  can only take it bi weekly because of tolerance, and maybe the occasional adderall wasn't helping with the tolerance.  But the adderall is gone. The only stim I can get at the moment is 3-fea. Is that going to  be stronger than the 3-fpm ?  But it's for focusing at work or just days when I'm  best from work 45 or more hours at work.  I dont something as strong as meth strong I'm not into missing sleep because I work the only other rc stim a a available to me is 5-MAPB.  Which would be  better if  I wanted stronger than 3-fpm but not as strong as meth? And of  course is it the flap that has made my trips on dmt  , lsd, 2c,b not as good or do all benzo addiction effect my trips,  never noticed when I was on 4mg. of klonopin.  But I was   it off after doing nothing wrong like trying to get my refill early and flap took all those problems away , I'm going to try and switch back to klonopin,  I have a out 230 footballs,  and 102 2mg klonopin . I apologize again for not making my own thread, first day here and just needed advice that's good not from some Dr. or prick who days your an idiot , quit all that research now. Please some good advice on what's happening to me.

Just trying to understand a little better what your situation is.\n\nIt sounds to me that you would benefit the most from taking a long break from all research chemicals after tapering off of whatever flualprazolam habit you have by using diclazepam or your remaining klonopin.\n\nNone of the stimulants you've come across will fit your needs or help you remedy your situation.  3-FEA is fairly serotonergic, meaning that it won't focus you like 3-fpm and you can't use it very often.  5-MAPB is way more serotonergic (ala MDMA) and will not give you any sort of energy or focus that you're looking for in a stimulant.\n\nIf you want my honest advice, you need to start with dropping the stims first and balancing out.  The only stimulant that might help you at all is 2-FMA which is still pretty widely available and is weaker than meth and less euphoric than either adderall or meth.  If you end up getting any 2-FMA try to use it to get off the 3-fpm/adderall by taking a single dose in the morning and reducing that dose over time.\n\nThe flualprazolam is likely what's diminishing your response to psychedelics and if you're taking it every day it's definitely the primary thing you need to focus on getting off.  Luckily, it sounds like you have a decent enough stockpile of medium-acting pharma benzos to help cushion the fall should that be necessary.  May I ask how much flualp you have been taking daily?\n\nThere's no need to apologize bud, I can understand being in dire straights and not understanding reddit's format at first.  I've certainly abused stimulants heavily myself, although not RC stims to any significant extent.  Additionally, I've never been dependent on benzos but I certainly have experience with benzo+stimulant binges that can really flip your head upside-down.  I'm sure that others here will be able to chime in with advice on dealing with the flualp problem as many people here are unfortunately familiar with this terrain. \n\nAs long as you go slow and follow a taper (i.e. the Ashton Manual) you should be just fine.

I truly wasn't trying to be rude, I figured you were probably typing fast.  \n\nI'm glad to hear that you don't feel that the stimulants are a problem for you and I hope you don't have any issues putting them down for a bit.  Letting the stimulant anxiety dissapate before doing anything with your benzo dose is probably a good idea and the lack of stimulation might even help you fall asleep easier without the aid of benzos.\n\nThe most concerning thing is definitely the flualp.  5-10mg of flualp is a *ton* to be taking every day, multiple times a day.  With how potent flualp is you might be able to taper off on your own but please keep in mind that reaching out to a doctor might be the right call at some point.  Everyone is different, but coming off that much flualp is going to take some willpower and dilligence to do safely.  I try not to judge because lord knows I'm extremely educated when it comes to drugs and I've still managed to get myself into some bad situations.  I won't say much more except reiterate that you need to start working on getting off or reducing your dose ASAP, preferably with the help of the Ashton manual (and get some diclazepam).\n\nAs for the DMT, I've definitely experienced something similar with psychedelics over the years where they have become much less visual than they used to be.  Thinking about my own experiences actually made something click in relation to a research project I just finished a few weeks ago.  The loss of visual phenomenon is likely due to the stimulants  as well since hallucinogens heavily depend on interactions with mGlu2 glutamate receptors in the brain (cortex mostly) to elicit their effects.  Stimulants obviously modulate glutamatergic signaling and most likely lead to altered levels of mGlu2-5HT2a heterodimers in the brain after chronic use.  Between altered cortical GABA signaling and mGlu signaling it is possible that both classes of drugs have made your brain less sensitive to the sensory phenomenon associated with tripping.  It's also possible that between using all three classes of drugs you simply respond to the DMT experience differently than you used to.

Could also be a decent component in the Borax combo, but in that case the straight stim you use there would need to be a heavy hitter, like maybe vyvanse. 3-FA could be used in combo with 4-FEA as well but its such a special drug I would only use it by itself.\n\nIts a real shame that 4-FA is near impossible to find now.

That's because my whole motivation for buying it was that I was craving amphetamine so I thought why not switch it up see if I could stimfap on this etc. Because of this my tolerance to amphetamines is really high right now, so I doubt any of my dosage would be sensable for a \"normal\"  user (this really shows in comparison of my doses to the reccomended ones lol)\n\nAnother thing is (I've seen only 1 person talk about this)  this shit keeps you stimulated CRAZY long. It's been almost 30 hours since my last redose yet here I am, feeling totally sober but skipped 3 nights and the hallucinations are coming in really strong all of a sudden, way more intense than after amphetamine binge (for me so far at least) so I'm gonna try to get a lot of sleep later today or tonight.\n\nAs a last sidenote, I do have \"experience\" with these stim binges and abuse, it's still a bad thing to do but at least I know to properly feed, hydrate myself and stretch and do important things like that. Also have every supplement in the world at my disposal.\n\nANYWAY you can tell I still have stimulation going on by the fact that this FOREWORD is already the length of what could be the whole post lmao. Soooo here is the report:\n\n\\---------\n\nI was able to get really good, clean trustworthy pills of these bad boys, 100mg pills that are dividable in two.\n\n**T0:00 :**     I take a bite, so roughly a little less than a quarter of one of them, just to see if everything reacts well so I can now if I can really go for it.       (Prob around 20-25 mg)\n\n\\-------\n\n**T0:40:**   I feel absolutely nothing beyond normal, so I start out with the remainder of that pill I broke a piece off of. ( 80 - 85 mg)\n\n\\--------------\n\nsomewhere between these times I actually distinctly noticed colours looked different , which I read in a few reports as well. Maybe it was just bias from having read those reports that day but it did seem distinctly vibrant and warm , for a low dose in a dark room\n\n**T1:30:** At this point I realize how high my tolerance must be , since 100mg is given as a high dose in most places, yet I basicly felt nothing. It felt like a low , functional dose of 2FMA or dexedrine. I was awake and able to concentrate but wouldn't know I was high if I didn't have the memory, ya know. For this reason I chat with someone that took this before (also with tolerance) and decide I'm good to go to 200mg.  My plan was to do a possible redose early in the night, to prevent binge and sleep defficiency, and that awful entactogen/empathogen comedown where you get sad but you're still stimulated. (For those of you who didn't know, 4FMA releases significant amounts of serotonin. I actually saw one study suggesting it may even be more than mdma but I guess it's all new and hard to verify). I felt comforatble doing it because I never really abuse serotogenic stims, because I always feel exhausted and emotionally drained afterwards and not as casually \"yep let's do that again some time!\"  like with amphetamine. Sorry got derailed here I'll continue.\n\nImportant thing is at this time I took another pill so ( 1oo mg ,   now standing at 200 total )\n\nMy personal experience and theory with mdma is that you can't really extend a roll,you either dial down the intensity to make it longer or you make it intenser but shorter. That's why I never redose past 3 hours into mdma, because it has never even remotely brought back the \"true\" roll for me. Yes it stimulates, and can even feel euphoric but so can any amphetamine that doesn't require serotonin.  SOOOo I was planning to investigate slightly with this one but didn't have high hopes and indeed, my theory was confirmed. It was not possible to extend the roll, but I'll get to that later\n\n\\-----------\n\n**T1:42**\n\nDefinetely starting to feel a high now. Feels like how a good stimulant should feel; confident, clear headed and calm. That's generally the vibe I get from 2FMA, but this was way more relaxing (probs the serotonin is my guess).  I feel a soft \"glow\" of nicety, in my mood and the world. It's not over the top mdma love, and I would still be able to feel like this while sober , it's more of an emotion than feeling \"high\"   (yet, lol).  In this stage, I'm extremely good at doing what needs to be done around the house etc, even more than with traditional stims like adderall. I think the slightly reduced anxiety/inhibitions plays a role. Makes it feel even more clear headed and calm than dexedrine (at a low dosage that is. the other dose still had to kick in)\n\n\\-------\n\n**T:1:53**\n\nIt's def starting to kick in fast now, but I had no come up anxiety like I've occasionally had with mdma. Could just be that I'm used to the come ups more though, + I was alone in a safe space so couldn't get paranoid. At this point I loose interest in the concept of having to entertain myself, and I just gently lie down comfortably in bed and just enjoy the moment. Music of anything social seems overwhleming to my mind still, because even just the empty silent room was feeling pretty perfect to me. Blankets were getting softer to touch by the second. So basicly all the classic entactogen effects (more to come later) , but it hits SO differently from mdma. Mdma in my experience lingers somewhere in your subconsciousness annoyingly for a while, then it just straight up hits you in the face all at once. With 4FMA it was just a gradual upward slope, so gradual that it's relaxing instead of horrifying like when the molly hits you like a freight train.\n\n\\---------\n\n**T:2:00**\n\nHere is where I could definetely \"feel\" the high , also similary to mdma. With amphetamine I've never really \"felt\" high, just realized I looked or acted high. But this intoxicating bliss was just literally too strong to ignore at any moment. I'm really gonna talk about this feeling now and I don't neccecarily want to promote this chem because there's a lot of downsides and seems to affect people differently , but basicly;\n\nyou know on mdma you have moments, esp at the come up, where you just can't stop stretching and yawning because your body feels so warm/relaxed, like that warm glow flooding in from inside? I think it's a pretty consistent effect on mollly, but never had it for more than like 10 minutes at a time. Which don't get me wrong, it's perfect. This however kicked it up a notch. In return for the really slow come up, (basicly the come up for this drug if you're going full dose is a very slow transition from functional to emphathogenic stim), resulted in the longest, most intense and euphoric rush I've ever felt. It was literally hard to do anything, because I was just crawling around bed moaning from the physical bliss.  I've also got mild nystagmus going exactly like how it'd be on mdma, though the gurning was a lot more controllable. (The biting was more like cheek/tongue biting like on amphetamine, not that ultra-strength chewing muscles thing as much )\n\n\\---------\n\n**T:2:15**\n\nI made a note here saying something like \"dude I'm full on rolling\" because I couldn't believe it. I was rolling super hard, and STILL this euphoric rush was coming over my body, it was honestly almost overwhelming (it was amazing at home but in public I'd go ape because of the lack of concentration and zoning out ).\n\nListening to music was incredibly, at least equally good as on mdma perhaps even better. Spiritual is all i can say. Raw, emotional, mood vibes that are totally coming from you and the music and no outside thoughts. Effortlessly meditating. I know I'm basicly just giving a promo for this chem now lol but there's downsides which I'll get to too. My original plan for buying this stim was to fap, but I was already in heaven listening to music and the notion of stopping that to fap just felt dumb (+ my fapping experience on mdma was lackluster) so I just spent the whole roll lying there, listening to music and chatting with friends and strangers online.\n\nDuring this rushing period, I had constant dark-hued faded but clearly visable Closed Eye Visuals. I also experienced a few minor halllucinations. This all looked exactly like what I experience on mdma, even the CEV looked the same.\n\n\\---------\n\n**T:2:45**\n\nThis is the moment the \"rush\"  pretty much stopped. It was very noticable, but not in a bad way, just like someone slowly slowly slowly claused the serotonin faucet in my brain. I was still rolling balls and would continue to roll balls for a while, but that physical orgasm-like feeling was fainting away slowly but surely. This was also the moment the roll started decreasing in intensity very slowly. It follows a very different pattern from mdma in my experience;  mdma rolls are short but chaotic, with moments of feeling randomly sober and these random huge flashes of physical euphoria, rolling in and out. With this all of that was just concentrated in that one moment, and there was no \"rolling\"  in and out of euphoria afterwards, just a very slow and steady decline.\n\nI think my roll lasted another good 1.5 - 2 hours or so.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I did try to redose late and see if I could bring back of extend the roll. Neither was succeeded. Even with a double dosage, there was not even a shred of rolling to continue or come back. I didn't feel a lot more stimulated either. It actually mostly just made me feel physically unwell which is the greatest downside of this chem. Most people seem to have issues with heartrate , heat and headache. I think because I was inside, nonmobile and well hydrated I wasn't at a big risk and my heartrate was actually very normal the whole night. It did however cause my stomach to go in a state incapable of processing food. I don't know how or what the mechanism is, but I ate a banana and half a  day later I had to throw up the banana which was still very much intact in pieces. I couldn't keep anything in and even water tasted bad. But, for the more serious issues, luckily there was nothing to note. Temperature was a  little high and I felt a little cold but nothing unlike most other stims.\n\n\\--------\n\n**T:4:30  +**\n\nJust like the come up was a gradual shift from functional stim to entactogen, the comedown was the other way around. I had ZERO of that instant nostalgia or instant sadness which I've gotten literally every time I do mdma, regardless of alone or with others, location, etc. In general , after mdma I feel drained and a little worried/anxious, here this was not the case BUT this may be due to the redoses. I was still very stimulated , which I now know from the fact that it's days later and I still am stimulated. But it doesn't have that sharp \"edge\"  that I'm used to of amphetamine, so I didn't judge my own state correctly.\n\nAlso of possible interest;  I attempted to masterbate and it was literally impossible. I don't mean like stim dick, because on amphetamine I can beat that deformed little shit into a pulp and it can still feel good. It was just like my dick and brain didn't work at all. Like I became temporarily asexual. I could actually get hard easily but it wouldn't \"go\" anywhere no matter what I did, so after 2 hours of frustration I gave up. I tried a few more times later but actually had to wait untill today (so more than a whole day later) before I could orgasm again. But good to know my dicks not broken anyawy.\n\nTHe \"failed binge\"  I'm referring to in the title was me waiting all night for me to get in \"the mood\"  that I get in in an addy binge, but it never came. Different moods entirely. So the redosing just kept me awake and got me sick. **Don't redose late with this shit!** It's absolutely worthless and adds nothing to your high, maybe extends it a little but redosing made me physically slightly ill. - it also gave me a very unpleasant dry throat similar to what it felt like after a week long adderall binge. Where it's so dry it becomes physically impossible to swallow. So make extra sure you stay hydrated. And gum saved my life! The gurning wasn't really near how it is on mdma but it was especially useful to keep the saliva flowing through mouth and throat. otherwise that feeling kind of sucked. Don't know what causes it exactly.\n\nSeen so many strongly negative reactions to this substance, usually either\n\n\\- headache (  I have yet to see a case for this with oral, everyoone descibes headaches and other pain in the sinusses after snorting. Don't snort this drug. Which gets me to the second criticism)\n\n\\- It doesn't work ;  the people saying this are either snorting it, in which case it's extremely unreliable (not ineffective per se, just unprodicable and hella bad for your noseholes so don't do it. Plus the rush this gives from oral alone makes snorting totally unnececary.  Also seen a lot of people who regulary do amphetamines (like me) who simply need a lot more. Despite this being one of my most euphoric experiences ever, I really don't even feel like repeating it. It's like there's a natural filter for being addicted to these because they're so mindfucky. It's a wild ride to go on. Unless you go on it all the time in which case it's hardly a ride anymore. And that's my final point; yall gotta have more patience with the emphatogens/entactogens. Half the reports I read saying it didn't \"feel like a roll\"  were people who abused serotogenic stims the same week. I don't know why I'm trying to hard to be a smartass here.\n\nBasicly my point is, this drug is very interesting, very euphoric -   and therefore probably also has high potential for addiction so beware ,  and most definetely overlooked! There's no concrete evidence yet to support that it's spefically damaging or unhealthy compared to other similar stims. Of course there are risks but idk why this one specifically gets  a bad rap. Just avoid it if you're prone to migraines, I guess. I had a swell time, 10/10 will gladly reccomend to anyone who's looking for an mdma alternative. I actually prefer this experience to mdma but I'll be more sparing with this, because there's less known and who knows what is going on behind the screens.\n\n*Footnote;  there was a significantly stronger psychedelic edge to this than MDMA, but they play with similar mindfucks. For example, being in a different room or thinking you're in a different room than you are. Objects standing upside down.  Signs that say nonsensical or personal things. Just to name a few. No visual filters or geometry except for the closed eye visuals which are to me very typical of what they look like on mdma. Also weird dejavus, flashbacks, flash forwards and time just generally acting strange. Even though this felt more psychedelic, mdma still feels more \"chaotic\"  to me, maybe just because of the more time having experienced it.*\n\n*Footnote 2:  For going to a festival or something active, I would not suggest 4FMA. for two simple reasons;*\n\n\\- anectodaly, it seems to raise heartrate more and cause overheating more\n\n\\- It has a very strong serotonin releasing ability that will making laying down awesome, so trying it at home is a win and not a loss\n\nFootnote 3:\n\nsorry yall I know how fucking speedy this wall of text is lmao. But I wanted to add,\n\nthis definetely gave me a lot of memory loss , but I don't know if it's to the same extent as mdma. I know with mdma I always remember \"moments\"  of the peak, but never a lot and never accurately, and it seems to fade away like a dream, especially right in the middle of coming down. (in my experience)\n\nI know I lost a shit ton of memory because I was looking at my browser history of that night just now, and there were like 30 youtube videos I had no memory of watching, mostly music I listened to. idk this isn't really shocking to me as it's normal for me with mdma, not everyone seems to get affected that way to the same extent though\n\n\\--------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR   -   Had a beautiful really strong euphoric roll, but dosed too much/late so I'm still in the residual stimulation which there is a lot of.  Way underrated chem imo if used properly. Great alternative for mdma but dosage seems tricky according to the wildly varying dosage numbers I've seen. But always stick to the safe side to be sure.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone even has the patience to read this, feel free to ask anything. I'll also post an update later today or tomorrow to see if the depression is gonna jump at me or what. So far I've felt nothing but relaxation for two days so think I'm stilll a little high heheh\n\n\\-------\n\nupdate;   it's now a few days later and I finally got  a good few hours of sleep. I spent half of yesterday in a dream like world since my field of vision was just absolutely filled with constant lifelike hallucinations,never experienced something like that before. it wasn't scary/bad but kind of overwhleming but also fascinating, I've seen visions I'll probably never forget. tried to force myself to sleep to kind of \"sober up\" but it was a hopeless endeavor, but now woke up from like a 4-6 hour nap and feel absolutely refreshed and good.\n\nmood is good currently, and today's the first moment i feel safe to take supplements (whatever was still in my system has to be out at this point) so I took some 5htp + egcg as a preventive measure and will continue. But so far no experience of the mdma style mini depression, though i usually don't get it after rolling either.

Anyways looks like you had a pretty fun ride -and by the looks of it still having lol-, I didn't read the whole thing I just saved it for when I'm craving a good trip reports. Anyways you called it a good alternative to MDMA, All I knew about the substance is that it's a stim so never really researched it, Since I don't use stims, But is it a psychedelic stim like MDMA? does it have hallucinogenic properties? Serotonergic euphoria? Would you say it's as likely to cause addiction as MDMA, Or like the more compelling, Classical dopaminergic stims?", "replies": {"f92j2p5": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/e3div5/4fma_report_super_intense_blissful_roll_followed/f92j2p5/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1575062052.0, "body": "( Oh my lord I just saw how long this response got. Legit I'm trying to keep it short but yeah lollll )\nyeah I'm still doing pretty okay haha, feeling stone cold sober yet also awake for 3.5 days and not tired so something's fishy here lol\n\nAnyway, MDMA is actually a stimulant as well ofc, but more strongly serotonergic. I've seen some research that said 4FMA actually has even more serotonin release then mdma, which I wouldn't be surprised by compared to the experience. The psychedelic properties felt pretty much exactly the same as the ones on mdma to me. Also the social and love feelings etc. 4FMA gave me slightly more hallucinations, (but of the same type and intensity, just more frequent) , and a few different physical side effects. That along with the exact duration were the only differences I could pick up on. \n\nAlso I don't know if you're aware , but MDMA and other serotonin-dominant stims are very unlikely to cause addiction, because the effect can't be replicated consistantly. Of course psychological addiction is totally possible, but even then that's most likely the chance for someone who is already mentally unwell, in which case there's a good chance the comedown /  after effects will be good enough reason not to do it too much. Of course I'm not denying there's people out there addicted to MDMA, but it's one of the least likely of popular drugs to get addicted to.\n\n4FMA feels like an MDMA roll embedded within a classical dopaminergic stim experience. The \"roll\" part felt totally seperate and emotional, and the stimulated parts before and after (where I\"m in now) feel totally functional and like medium dose dopaminergic stims. \n\nPersonally I have had problems with overusing dopaminergic stims, but never serotnergic , as they start to produce specific kinds of side effects really soon that suck so much I just can't imagine consistently doing it. For example, restless leg syndrome (which weirdly is seen mostly through dopamine but has for me only been triggered by mdma and 4FMA )", "replies": {"f92l5mw": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/e3div5/4fma_report_super_intense_blissful_roll_followed/f92l5mw/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1575064317.0, "body": "Thanks for a detailed reply.

I honestly wonder how the serotonin system of a daily meth user even works. How it finds new balance. Anyway sidetracked uhh\n\nOh yeah as for your question, it seems to have both but in my experience is 1000% more empathogen then bingy stims;  like I said, I tried to binge and failed and boy have I binged on things before, this one just doens't really allow it. I've noticed this with mdma too, think it's fascinating actually (but don't know if there's already science to explain this), that taking more or longer in succesion not only doesn't work, it causes dysphoria. I remember reading somewhere that high serotonin decreases dopamine or something, in any case, what it feels like to me, to attempt a emphatogen binge, is first you roll, then you try to recreate that roll, and fail , going backwards to lower and lower dopamine. With the most mdma I've ever taken ( a mistake was made that evening) it caused issues that are normally resprentative of low dopamine which is interesting. \nI've never had that same issue with more dopamine focused stims. And ofc it's not a clear cut distinction, I know amphetamine has some SERT activity as well. \nOkay I don't remember if I actually answered your question with this whole story. To summarize, i'd say it's more the psychological properties, because this substance created textbook \"ecstacy\"/\"euphoria\", like a literal state of perfect carefree happiness. \nIt didn't have any of the \"tasty\" and compulsive feeling nature of the dopamine oriented stims. I feel like MDMA is actually more dopamine-compulsion/addiction causing, I've noticed the same irrational/delusional redosing thoughts on mdma as on amphetamine (although it's just my guess/intuition that that's related to dopamine)\n4-FMA to me actually felt like how 6APB is often described, as more serotonin and feeling focussed and less stimulated than MDMA. I think the hyper stimulation is my least favourite part of mdma. \nFor example; you're feeling blissed and want to listen to music, but waste 15 minutes going through pictures of your aunts cat on facebook because you opened your phone. like its fun but I don't really enjoy tunnel vision.\n\nedit; and how could I forget, as for the advice, I always got my kratom on hand. Makes stim comedowns very bearable as long as there's food in me first. Kratom is a lifesaver. But i'm also a daily user so I don't really have a choice lol.\n\nedit 2; another argument for the first part of this post; I couldn't experience sexual arousal on 4FMA. I could on ecstacy . there were no differences in my surroundments or state or mind. idk about you but for me the sex/fapping is the number 1 trigger for addictive stim behaviours. So at least it didn't do that for me. \nI also tried taking more and more and it didn't seem to \"rush\" in when I took a new big dose, like with adderall. Like even after a three day binge if you take a daily big dose in one go it will rush in and create that pleasurable effect, with 4FMA I just got more and more dysphoria and threw up a bunch. So it is definetely harder to abuse.", "replies": {"f939857": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/e3div5/4fma_report_super_intense_blissful_roll_followed/f939857/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1575081903.0, "body": "I actually kept thinking of 6-APB when I was reading your report.

You can waste hours in that mental purgatory between rolling and speeding but it's just the worst of both worlds imo.\n\nI think it's really hard to say because I still don't understand exactly how amphet tolerance works. For me , I developed this huge tolerance by doing a 3 day binge every other week for a month or so. Idk how you would accurately test it in relation to crosstolerance as well.\n\nFor this reason it's probably safest to always do a first dose thats below 80, then judged on that continue. If tolerance is not an issue at all 80mg would probably feel like 80mg of mdma, so warm rolling effects but not totally gurning etc. If I were feeling even a hint of rolling I would have redosed lower but it was really that other 100mg that did the trick. \nReports on this have been really varied too... So sadly can't really give a yes or no on any dosage advice, just that as long as you start with a first dose below 80 you will be totally fine. Even without tolerance people have gone above 150 , but then it gets heavy on the body. \nSooo I guess the moral of the story is start careful , wait an hour. This stuff can take pretty long but never took longer than an hour. Then if you really don't feel anything like I had you can prob just take like another 50-80, and if you're low key rolling already just a booster dose. But yeah it's so tricky to say. I wish more people would do this so we had better information :/  perhaps one day in the future\nAnyway I really hope that goes well, I had an amazing time and perhaps the best music enhancement I've ever experienced , so if it works you're in for a treat!\nand as a last thing, i already said this in the post but do not be tempted to snort it .

Still, that\u2019s animal models, huge grain of salt to comes with that. It\u2019s a pemoline derivative, iirc pemoline was taken off market due to very, very rare cases of prolonged use causing liver toxicity in children. 1-2% of tested patients taking pemoline were positive for elevated liver enzymes, a risk factor in future toxicity. The main problem was that despite to rare occurrence of toxicity, they were often unpredictable and exhibited rapid onset (<2 weeks), which was enough for pemoline to be taken off market. Summaries from Wikipedia below:\n\n\u201cCyclazodone has not been evaluated by the United States Food and Drug Administration for use in humans as a nootropic, anorectic, or stimulant and thus safety information on Cyclazodone is lacking. However, in studies relating to the therapeutic uses of Cyclazodone, it was noted that Cyclazodone exhibited less cardiotoxic and hepatotoxic effects than D-Amphetamine in studies on mice.[6]\n\n\u201cSince receiving FDA approval in 1975, pemoline has been linked with 21 cases of liver failure, of which 13 resulted in liver replacement or death. Approximately 1-2% of patients taking the drug show elevated levels of liver transaminase enzymes, a marker for liver toxicity, though serious cases are rare. Over 200,000 children with ADHD were prescribed pemoline in the US and Canada alone during the 25 years it was available, plus a smaller number of adults prescribed it for indications such as chronic fatigue syndrome and apathy in the elderly (and not including prescriptions in the rest of the world), so the number of liver failure cases was statistically not that large. However the reactions proved idiosyncratic and unpredictable, with patients sometimes taking the drug with no issue for months or even years, before suddenly developing severe liver toxicity.\u201d", "replies": {"g0iy752": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i3lw9w/does_cyclazodone_actually_feel_like_amphetamine/g0iy752/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1596716887.0, "body": "That makes sense.

I would describe it as relatively mild, albeit addictive, and that was particularly true when vaping it; I found myself constantly wanting more and there was no satisfaction. I usually snorted bumps about the size of small apple seeds in addition to vaping it, so the ROAs were done in tandem at regular intervals throughout the day. I'll note my main observations below. \n\nWhenever I vaped a lot of NEP in one sitting, there seemed to be a dose ceiling and I probably wasted a lot of product. When vaped, it has a pleasant fruity-floral odor with jammy, cotton-candy tonalities and slightly erogenous musk undertones. In fact, it's somewhat reminiscent of a musk odorant called Applelide. When too much heat is applied, the odor is unpleasant. Above all, avoid applying too much heat or you will be in for a nasty surprise. I developed a chesty cough, and although vaping is probably the most enjoyable ROA, I'll probably stick with insufflation should I ever purchase NEP in the future.  \n\nRegarding euphoria, I would say that it's about the same intensity as strong dose of Adderall or maybe even a bit stronger, albeit more recreational and less functional. It would not be unlike taking 60 to 80 mg of Adderall (baseline tolerance) and retaining only the euphoria without feeling wired or robotic. NEP is mild enough that I was able to work and go about my business while using it. I don't believe I appeared high to the people around me. Someone else mentioned that it could keep him going for days, but I never attempted to do that. In general, I dosed it with sufficient respect in order to avoid anxiety and paranoia. Going to bed wasn't particularly easy because I wanted to stay up and keep vaping, but once I did finally get into bed, I had no problems falling asleep. \n\nWhen the 5 grams ran out, I found myself thinking about NEP for a day or two, but I wouldn't describe my frame of mind as desperate and I didn't feel particularly depressed. I did rummage around looking for stray crystals at first, but once I had accepted that the supply was completely exhausted, I got on with my life. Overall, NEP is probably useful as both a functional a recreational stimulant, although compulsive redosing could be a distraction in functional contexts. It was mild enough not to interfere with my life, but as I said before, I treated it with respect and never pushed the limit. Be very careful if you decide to use it.\n\nEdit: Based on feedback in the commments, other people don't find this substance as tame as I do. It keeps them from sleeping and it takes them time to get back to normal after their supply runs out. Some reported depression. When I ran out, I replaced it with isopropylphenidate, so perhaps that helped soften the blow. Avoid these substances if you can, but if you're hellbent on experimenting, be extremely careful.

Supposedly, modafinil may influence your cognitive ability while stimulants such as Adderall really only effect your confidence/energy; e.g.: modafinil may be a nootropic. \n\nModafinil, initially, made me kinda antisocial, emotionally disconnected, but laser eye focused. Which is weird, since I'm generally a very social person. Modafinil helped reinforce healthy eating habits and exercising, and over time (6+ months of using modafinil or armodafinil 1-3 times a week), modafinil made me more in touch with my emotions and the antisocial effects wore off. I really liked modafinil as made.me feel clean, sharp, and there is no abuse potential. Modafinil (to me) is like an optimal caffeine buzzing without the jitters or rush: my brain optimization is cranked up several notches, I have the focus to complete tasks without challenge, and I have levels of energy that are SUSTAINABLE...\n\n2-FMA was pretty great, but also kind of abusable. Modafinil, in my exp., Can't really be abused, but 2-FMA, just keep doing line after line or dose and after and you get more and more energy (while on modafinil I could fall asleep!) 2-FMA definitely sped me up and didn't cause any negative social issues like modafinil, but also, 2-FMA didn't seem to really *help* my brain, or help with learning or focus. It just gave me energy! Which...was fun. But, nothing special tbh. \n\nLastly, 4F-MPH I enjoyed but it made me nervous. It's so potent! One time, I abused 4fmph all night and actually bit euphoria on it but couldn't sleep for the next 20 hours. They say 4F-MPH may be most similar to ritalin, while 2-FMA may be most similar to Adderall minus the euphoria(forme). 4F-MPH is pretty fucking gnarly in a good way. This substance had helped sustain my brain and energy levels during long work days of 20+ hours while on day 2 of no sleep! 4F-MPH also felt very, very clean and didn't really fuck with my social ability. In one instance, I manned a food truck window for 6+ jours while we had 20+ people in line at all times, and I WAS A MACHINE! I'd hand out orders with ease, take orders with ease, and I was making every individual laugh that talked to me at the window (and ofc had a great team behind me), but seriously, I was a machine...\n\nPersonally,\nModafinil: low risk of abuse/never abused/BUT WORKS BEST WHEN YOUR HEALTHY! It's awesome..., long term good, interesting effect; seems to effect the neurological side of things and can mess with emotions in a weird way too (being disconnected then to being the most empathetic person ever where NPR radio be making ya cry).\n\n2-FMA: can be abused, but really no point. Just kind of clean energy. Nothing special. Give or take. Definitely a very clean feeling but I can't say it helps me with motivation or gives a feeling of actually assisting me, whereas modafinil feels like the oil to my gears. But, not bad at all. \n\n4F-MPH: can be abused as well, but by the time I ever got euphoria I couldn't sleep for 20 hours. Very potent\n However... It's a machine like energy. As in, you get in your groove and you stay in it. Brings about focus and energy! But takes a bit of messing around with to find optimal levels, and I wouldn't wanna take 4F-MPH everyday because it seems numbing emotionally/experience wise (e.g.: Ritalin). But worth a shot.\n\nALL IN ALL...\n\u2022 Modafinil (BRAIN FOOD): catalyst for life change, honestly; no potential for euphoric abuse, but the effects change the more you use it. A great tool, honestly. Made me feel healthy, clean. Good energy. (Despite mods challenging my emotions and socialskills, I think each experience was constructive)\n\n\u2022 2-FMA (ENERGY): straight energy that left me wanting more. But not bad. Just an empty experience, and also a strong stimulant. (Once almost got alcohol poisoning due to 2-FMA drowning out the effects of 15+ red bull vodkas in Vegas and me being stupid).\n\n\u2022 4F-MPH (FOCUS): interesting chemical with a high ceiling! Seems to optimize your movements and thoughts, like a machine. Doesn't fuck with my emotions or socialability like modafinil. And it isn't just straight energy like 2-FMA.

If you had to choose between the three go with 2-fma due to it having a lower recreational value than 4f-mph (this is more euphoric but has heavy peripheral and anxiety inducing side effects when at euphoric doses) and the clear headed stimulation it provides. 2-FMA is one of the best drugs to use for studying along with straight adderall (which I find a bit more helpful personally because I find it has an edge that encourages diving into work). Ritalin works too, but causes more side effects imo and 4f-mph falls in line with this due to the increased side effects with about the same focus enhancement as amphetamine. So yea in short, 2-FMA is the best option with modafinil being a good backup for less intensive study days.

I wanted to share this because I wish I had seen a post like this before trying to insufflate 3-Fluoroamphetamine. I figured I'd write this up in the hopes that anyone considering trying to snort 3-FA would see this post and reconsider.\n\nMy first order of 3-FA arrived recently, and I was excited to try it out. As my luck, or rather lack thereof would have it, a family member had borrowed my only scale, and left it in a place where I can't access it for a few weeks, at the least. I'm a inpatient person, so I decided to try some anyway.\n\nI researched 3-FA extensively before ordering it, and knew people had reported that snorting it had a horrible burn, and reported it as being quite unpleasant. However, in the past when I researched 4-AcO-DMT, people reported similar unpleasant experiences when snorted. I found that, in my opinion, the reports were greatly over exaggerated, and while I did experience some discomfort, it was rather minor. I've also snorted Adderall, and didn't find it uncomfortable. I figured it would be a similar story with 3-FA.\n\nMy plan was to try a small line, wait for it to kick in, and see how I felt.\n\nI set it up, took a snort, and immediately realized y'all were right. I cannot stress this enough, **holy fuck.** It felt like I had just snorted a massive line of horseradish and sand, and then held a lit match in my nose. The feeling went away after ~5-10 minutes, but it was remarkably unpleasant.\n\nI haven't snorted anything outside of 4-AcO-DMT, Adderall, and 3-FA, so maybe I'm not used to it, but for anyone who is as inexperienced as me, I definitely would not recommend snorting.\n\nI'm at 53 minutes after dosing, and its quite pleasant now, I think I went just a touch under the ~60mg to ~80mg dose I was aiming for, so at least that's nice.\n\nTL;DR 2/10, do not snort.\n\nEdit: I redosed 2 and 1/2 hours ago orally with a friend, both of us taking a visually similar amount of 3-FA, and it does feel a bit stronger than insufflated. If I had to guess, I would say close to 40 to 50mg of Adderall IR oral, but its hard to tell as the euphoria is stronger which makes me feel like its stronger than a similar dose of Amphetamine, but the stimulation is also definitely less than Amphetamine. I will probably try to combine it with a 2-F* analog for a closer effect to Amphetamine.\n\nThis is definitely the 3-FA talking, but I just wanted to say thanks for being nice everyone, I've lurked on this sub for a long time, and this is my first post and everyone is so nice! :)\n\nEdit 2: I'm at 4 hours after ingestion of the oral dose. The comedown, even through oral ingestion, feels much faster than Adderall. I feel like I could probably take a nap if I wanted to. At around 3 hours I definitely felt a perceptible drop in effects (minor to moderate euphoria and minor stimulation). Many other users stated that 3-FA is like a \"less productive, more euphoric Adderall,\" which I would agree is accurate. I've seen other users report combining 2-FA (or a similar analog) with 3-FA feels even closer to Adderall. So I think I will try that out and report back. Does anyone have any experience with this? If so, what ratio of 3-FA to 2-FA (or similar analog) would you recommend?\n\nEdit 3: At just a little before 6 hour after oral ingestion and the comedown/hangover/after effects are not fun. It likely didn't help that I dosed twice in the same day. The comedown feels pretty different from adderall/amphetamine, which I normally find rather minor or even non existent with my normal stack of vitamins and supplements (Magnesium, CoQ10, ALCAR, and R-ALA) and safe levels of over hydration, both of which I used with 3-FA as I would with Adderall. The hangover feels pretty different from Adderall, and worse than even a pretty bad amphetamine hangover. My hypothesis is that is due to the higher serotonin selectivity 3-FA has in comparison to Adderall. I would strongly recommended having some 5-HTP or something else to help with the serotonin comedown.\n\nOverall, 3-FA is *ok* in my opinion, but at the moment I still prefer Adderall. However, the price of 3-FA is less than half the price I can reliably get Adderall at. I intend on researching possibly mixing 3-FA with 2-FA or another analog (likely one of the 2-Fx's), to see if I can get it to feel closer to Adderall.", "author": "Throwaway6600k", "score": 15, "flair": null, "created": 1595377860.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/hvakf5/snorting_3fa_story/", "num_comments": 32, "title": "Snorting 3-FA (Story)", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fys4zus": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/hvakf5/snorting_3fa_story/fys4zus/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1595379109.0, "body": "Yeah amphetamines tend to burn like a sumbitch when snorted.

I've heard of people adding something like lidocaine as a numbing agent. IMO that just encourages more use and less awareness of the damage that's being done.\n\nAlso I'd recommend giving oral a try, I didn't find any of the fluoroamps to be significantly better via nasal. If you want to stick with snorting then it'd be a good idea to pick up a saline nasal rinse as it will significantly reduce any damage being done.

I tried to cut it down and trim the unnecessary bits, but it still came out a bit long.\n\nThe post I wrote above was my first experience with 3-FA, and I think I kinda screwed up my perception by not knowing what my actual dose was. I've also only snorted Adderall IR once (40mg), and never tried it again, because I found the effects to be highly disappointing. At the time, I had only done Vyvanse and Adderall a handful of times, and 40mg of IR taken orally was enough for me to be rather heavily stimulated. But I almost entirely didn't even feel the 40mg when snorted. I've been rather moderate with my Adderall dosages, usually nothing more than once every few weeks  to a month at the most, in doses from 60mg to 80mg, which I find to be highly productive, while still also very recreational. As a student, if I'm rereading a book for the fifth time, I at least want to feel good while I'm doing it, haha\n\nIn terms of effects, I definitely need to try it more, as my first dose felt a little different,  and a little underwhelming, but that might be because my usual ROA for Adderall is oral.\n\nFor this dose of 3-FA, I felt minor stimulation, a little more than 40mg Adderall IR intranasally. I definitely felt a little euphoria too, which I haven't experienced on an equivalent dose of Adderall IR. If I had to guess, I'd say it was somewhere between 40mg to 60mg, as a guess.\n\nI could see strong potential for recreational uses with 3-FA, if it was taken in a higher dose, and orally.\n\nOn my usual dose of Adderall, I feel **highly** motivated to get shit done, literally non stop. On this, I really didn't feel much of a difference in terms of my motivation. But if my guess for my dosage is correct, on an equivalent doses of Adderall I would feel a similar amount of motivation.\n\nWhen people on this sub talk about it, they compare it to Adderall but as \"less productive, more euphoric,\" which I didn't really understand, but now I *think* I see what they mean. It's hard for me to explain, but it's just kinda like that.\n\nI typically use 400mg to 600mg of Phenylpiracetam, 150mg to 200mg of Caffeine, and some L-Theanine with Adderall because I love being overstimulated. I ran out of Phenylpiracetam, and I think it definitely increases my motivation, even on Adderall, so that could be playing a role in my experience.\n\nI'm thinking of buying another scale, because eyeballing this is really skewing my perception of 3-FA. I ordered a very large volume of 3-FA, enough to have a really bad time if I went nuts, as I ordered a little over a lethal dose for my weight (assuming the LD50 is similar to Adderall at ~20 to ~25 mg per kg). I highly doubt I would reach that, but stimulants can still get very uncomfortable in high enough doses. As a result, I'm trying to lean towards the safe side for now, at least until I get a scale.\n\nIf I find I'm not getting the motivation I'm looking for when I take higher doses, I've seen some people report mixing it with 2-FA, and they report that combo is notably closer to Adderall, so I may try that combo next.\n\nI've also seen some posts on here from users saying that the 3 series of fluorinated amphetamines don't work for them. You may want to consider if its possible that is the case for you as well, based on your experience with 3-FEA. It would really suck for you to order some and then find out it doesn't do anything for you :(\n\nI don't know much about 3-FEA, but from my quick research it looks like its more euphoric, but less stimulating than 3-FA, so maybe that played a role?\n\nTL;DR I'm not 100% sure, I need to try it more to give a solid answer.\n\nI just redosed with a visually similar amount orally with a friend, so with any luck that'll give me more insight.\n\nIf you would like, I think in a week or so I should have researched 3-FA enough to have a concrete answer. I was thinking of writing it up as a post on here, and I would be quite happy to DM it to if you'd like!\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention the following\n\n1) I got some pretty heavy jaw clenching on 3-FA. I get jaw clenching on amphetamine too, but this *felt* like a fair bit more clenching than I would expect to get on a similar dose of Adderall.\n\n~~2) Just checked out the dose of 3-FEA you took, and it sounds like you took more than  double a heavy dose. Do you use stimulants frequently?~~ If not, or if you don't have much of a tolerance, I would definitely lean towards thinking the 3 series of fluorinated amphetamines might not work for you, sorry :(\n\nEdit for point #2, talked with the poster and they explained that reported dosages are different from the dosages I had seen on Psychonaut Wiki.\n\nEdit 2: I redosed 2 and 1/2 hours ago orally with a friend, both of us taking a visually similar amount of 3-FA as I had snorted earlier down (~4 hours prior to this dose, the effects had died down quickly, lasted maybe 2 hours total), and it is stronger orally as compared to insufflated. If I had to guess, I would say close to 20 to 30mg of Adderall IR oral, but its hard to tell as the euphoria is stronger which makes me feel like its stronger than a similar dose of Amphetamine, but the stimulation is also definitely less than Amphetamine. I will probably try to combine it with a 2-F* analog for a closer effect to Amphetamine.\n\nEdit 3: I'm at 4 hours after ingestion of the oral dose. The comedown, even through oral ingestion, feels much faster than Adderall. I feel like I could probably take a nap if I wanted to. At around 3 hours I definitely felt a perceptible drop in effects (minor to moderate euphoria and minor stimulation). Many other users stated that 3-FA is like a \"less productive, more euphoric Adderall,\" which I would agree is accurate. I didn't understand or believe that was accurate before trying 3-FA, but its definitely just something you have to try to understand the feeling. My friend reported that they felt an equivalent Vyvanse dose would be somewhere around ~60mg of Vyvanse at the peak. I would agree, I'm more experience with Adderall, but I would say the peak felt like ~20mg to maybe ~30mg of Adderall, if I had to guess. Next time I take Adderall I'll compare as I'm sure I'll notice more differences.\n\nI'm thinking of combining 2-FA (or a similar analog) with 3-FA to get closer to the effect of Adderall.

Or maybe there are variations of strength in batches, or there were some precursors, byproducts, or fillers which increased the weight? Just a guess, I don't know much academically about drugs or chemistry, outside of my own research. I like to assume the best of vendors, and I doubt any reputable vendors would intentionally mess with the products, especially as they are already under a lot of scrutiny. I'm sure you ordered from a reliable vendor, but that kind of stuff just happens sometimes, RCs are definitely a bit of a \"wild west\" still, haha\n\n>so I started with about 90mg then redosed after about an hour and a half (first time I took it), I also regularly take adderall due to add, although I take weekends off,\n\nAnother total guess, but its definitely feasible that your Adderall prescription may have had some effect on either the perceived effects, or your tolerance. I'm not prescribed Adderall, but even after a few weeks I find, at least personally, my tolerance hardly decreases. I've tried everything I can find online that is suggested to lower tolerance, but nothing really works for me. My body develops tolerance to most drugs a lot faster than my friends, so maybe it's just me.\n\n>I used to have a decent coke habit but I've since stopped, it's kinda cool but unfortunately a few of my close family members are addicts so that kinda blows (they got into opiates)\n\nOh I'm really sorry to hear that, I feel bad that I said that, I'm very sorry!

No crazy jitters or anxiety. Little bit of jaw clenching and repetitiveness.

I also get a small dopamine boost and a small testosterone boost which stay relatively consistent and only minimally diminish. Sleep can be enhanced enough to make 7 hours feel like 9 but mag glycinate confounds that statement for me but I still stand behind, some, sleep enhancement. I suggest trying the jarrow formulas bottle, it\u2019s the cheapest per gram and still feels legit, the only con of this compound is it\u2019s exorbitant cost.

So I have to say it\u2019s a magical compound unlike any other, it\u2019s superior to racetams for me, and likely YMMV based on having ADHD or not and having the diagnosis is likely what makes it stand out so much and so quickly despite it working best after two weeks sustained use.", "replies": {}}}}}}, "g1b7v8f": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i8mtd1/best_stuff_to_boost_my_dopamine_level/g1b7v8f/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597339715.0, "body": "Deprenyl definitely works.

However, I also just bought a ton of drugs off the clearnet. Are these substances safe to use with Lexapro with decreased effects, and even if they are, what is the best way for me to store them without a fridge?  I might buy one if necessary.\n\n\nI enjoy tripping. I don\u2019t do it that often, maybe once every two weeks like most recommend. Currently, it\u2019s been more than a month since my last trip. As a result of this spacing, my trips are pretty meaningful to me, but I feel like I haven\u2019t been able to get that much out of it yet; I\u2019m still in my beginning phase, afraid to dive too deep. Since I like tripping so much, I decided about 10 days ago that I would finally purchase some RCs off the clearnet to try them out.  This way, I have a nice, legal way to enjoy the psychedelics I love so much. I\u2019ve seen these particular chemicals (500 mg of 4-ho-met, 250 mg of 4-ho-mipt, and 1 g of 6-apb) recommended often.\n\n\nHowever, I now have a problem: I visited a psychiatrist 6 days ago to attempt to get Adderall. Since then, it\u2019s already benefitted me greatly; I\u2019ve seen large improvements in my quality of life and work ethic, and I already feel much better as a result. My ADD/ borderline ADHD has been pretty detrimental to my life, making it nearly impossible to complete any work I wanted to do, among other issues, but I won\u2019t go into that.\n\n\nThe true issue is that, while at the doctor\u2019s office, he also diagnosed me with depression, and says it\u2019s on the severe side.  Therefore, he recommended me to go on Lexapro to help combat this.  My depression, in the past year while at my freshman year of college, was so severe that I missed all of my classes during the back half of my last two quarters.  I wasn\u2019t eating, I had trouble sleeping, I would only leave my room when necessary, and I didn\u2019t try to make friends or hang out with the few I had. I was practically not functioning.  From what I hear, this particular doctor is not inclined to prescribe medication either.  I\u2019m assuming that he truly believes my case is exceptional and that this medicine is my best course of action to help me exit this slump.  I attempted to refuse the medicine, but I couldn\u2019t really think of any good reasons NOT to go on it other than \u201cI just want to trip out on hard drugs\u201d, which I wasn\u2019t exactly about to tell him.  I think I really trust this man, he seems like he knows his stuff quite thoroughly, and I think it probably is my best option to follow his prescription, and I will be better as a result of it.\n\n\nHOWEVER. I just bought all these damn drugs, I don\u2019t have anyone to sell them to, and I\u2019m not about to get rid of them. So, now what do I do? I\u2019ve done some research on how the tryptamines combine with SSRIs, and I\u2019ve found mixed opinions. Some sources say they\u2019re fine together with less effect, some say they can\u2019t be combined together at all and it\u2019s dangerous, some say they had no difference at all, and I think I even read a report that someone had increased effects.  I\u2019ve been doing psychedelics for a while, and I\u2019ve never freaked out or had a bad time, so I don\u2019t think my current mental health is going to cause a bad trip.  I do want to try Lexapro, but I also want to trip sack occasionally.\n\n\nSo, I have a couple questions:\n1. If I choose to use the tryptamines on Lexapro, (I don\u2019t intend on using the 6-APB right now, unless I hear it\u2019s safe for certain) is this a bad idea or will I just need to experiment with higher doses?\n2. If I choose to wait until I\u2019m off the Lexapro, how should I store these substances to preserve them? I understand the 4-ho\u2019s are less stable than the 4-aco\u2019s, but what\u2019s my best course of action? I live with my parents and don\u2019t have access to a freezer. Should I just buy a mini-fridge? (If my parents let me)\n\nIf anyone could enlighten me on these topics, I would greatly appreciate it.  Yes, I\u2019ve googled it, searched it on Reddit, etc.; I\u2019ve done my homework; but I can\u2019t find a satisfactory answer for my particular issue, so I decided to post something here in the hopes that someone could help me.

It definitely has the \"I can do this, anything is possible\" sort of ego inflation and music euphoria, but it's completely functional, where as with other stimulants I'd find my self getting more distracted by the overwhelming euphoria and body euphoria. Where with this, the euphoria is strong and is present but is nearly not as close to overwhelming as the other stimulants. It's a very clean, almost relaxing smooth stim.

So, naturally, I thought I should try a-PCYP. \n\nThe vendor I got it from seems to be fairly reputable. I received this as a free sample. The material ranges from cloudy to clear, similar in appearance to 2F-DCK but with a tan tint. Has a somewhat sweet smell, faintly like fish as crystal but a cousin to vanilla when vaped. \n\nDay 1:\n\n1. T+00m: Vaped about 2mg. Felt nothing\n2. T+10m: Vaped a clear 10mg shard. Felt some numbness on my tongue. Then tightness in the chest, felt like the physical sensation you get when very anxious. Slight tachycardia. I don't feel intoxicated. Just generally uncomfortable, a bit jittery and shivering. Slight nausea.\n3. T+3:00 I attempt to vape another 10mg. I think I burn it again and hurt my lungs. I'm wheezing.\n4. T+3:20 snort 12mg. Not too caustic, but felt like glass shards. Maybe I didn't crush it up enough. Felt some more stimulation. Jacked off for an hour straight- the drug appears to promote pleasure-seeking activities. \n5. Conclusion: I don't think I vaped it properly and probably burned most of it. Probably did more damage than I got pleasant effects. \n\nDay 2:\n\n1. Ingested about 10mg. Felt some stimulation as before, though it lasted longer, maybe 2-4 hours.\n2. I attempted to smoke a couple more times in about 10-15mg increments. Maybe I'm a noob but it seemed hard to vaporize without burning. I did manage to inhale a bit of it and felt some euphoria. And then once I started to get the hang of it I of course broke my pipe trying to clean it.\n\nDay 3:\n\n1. Boofed 10mg in solution. It appears to be water soluble, but it takes a long time to dissolve. I could only hold it in for less than 5 minutes since it made me have to shit, so I likely didn't absorb all of it. Felt stimulation for about 1.5 hours, slight euphoria, and some bowel discomfort at first. I feel some burning in my rectum, perhaps due to causticity. I don't think I would boof it again. \n\nIn conclusion, I don't think I was able to properly utilize this chem. It seems that vaping and oral are the best out of the four ROAs I tried, however I wasn't really able to get a rush or much euphoria as I was expecting. I think part of the reason why may have been that I was smoking too little at a time, which made it vaporize very slowly or just turn brown and burn. The dominant effect was simulation, but in the way were you just sit there and feel jittery. I may try vaporizing again, I've heard that's worked well for other people.

Although it somewhat boosted motivation when combined (at MAO-B-selective doses) with phenylethylamine or phenylalanine, if anything it worsened anxiety.

It\u2019s perfect for someone who wants to have better sex without a full-on psychedelic experience. \n\nRunner-up: definitely phenibut. Has a strong anti-anxiety component which would be helpful, in addition to boosting libido. \n\nOther options like 5-MeO-MiPT or 2C-B that enhance libido might not be the best in this circumstance because of the anxiety factor. Moxy especially, while very pro-sexual, can really focus and enhance anxious thoughts.

NEP - I probably wouldn't buy it again.\n\nJust a few things I've wanted to document, none of which quite seem to be deserving of their own post...\n\n**3-FMA:** I've messed with this a little bit, and I like it a lot so far. It does seem like it might be entactogenic. I've taken doses of 25-35 mg orally. It feels a lot like Adderall, but it's warmer and less speedy. The comeup is pretty long, like 45-90 minutes. It lasts about 8-12 hours for me; fairly standard for an amphetamine derivative. Tolerance seems to build quickly - 25 mg the first day was stronger than 30 mg the day after. It is a lot more euphoric than 2-FMA. It's still motivating/productive but it also enhances music and sexual pleasure. Makes me wish that women wanted to have sex with me.\n\nIt's probably best to keep space between uses of this chemical due to possible serotonin action. I will write a full report after I have more experience.\n\n**3-HO-PCE and 3-HO-PCP:** I tried the PCE first [(report)](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/eldpya/starting_the_morning_with_3hopce/), then the PCP, so now I can offer a brief comparison. I use low to moderate doses, so this might not be applicable to higher doses. Your results may differ, of course.\n\n- 3-HO-PCE seems fairly balanced between stimulating and sedating. 3-HO-PCP is considerably more on the sedating side.\n\n- 3-HO-PCE has a bit of a \"cold\" feeling to it. 3-HO-PCP is \"warm\". 3-HO-PCP has that distinct opioid warmth to it (and mu-opioid affinity), which I have not felt from 3-HO-PCE at all.\n\n- 3-HO-PCE is trippy and not really euphoric, although it is pleasant. 3-HO-PCP is noticeably euphoric on its own, and it's easy to have an enjoyable experience with it.\n\n- The comeup for (oral) 3-HO-PCP is really long!\n\n**NEP:** Vaping NEP makes it really fun to vape more NEP! Not much else. So far, I've found the stimulation to be meh, the euphoria to be okay, and the comedown to be not worth it. Really, the best part of the experience has been vaping it (on foil) - it vaporizes very nicely, and call me weird, but I like the taste.\n\nI will try it oral and insufflated at some point. Edit - Not snorting this stuff again. Irritated the fuck out of my nose at just 20 mg.

I have seen reports suggesting that the dose where 4C-D gives it's full profile is in the MDMA range (\\~120mg), but decided that my first excursion should be conservative.\n\nI mixed my small bump of brilliant, white crystal powder with a little water and gulped it down in two or three swigs.  4C-D is mildly bitter, with hardly any aftertaste.  Not a good flavor, but one of the most palatable pure chemicals I have yet to try.  I had taken 1.2 g of kratom in the morning, 1 hour 45 mins prior.  I am familiar with these low, stimulating kratom doses and do not believe that it affected how I perceived the experience.\n\nT - 0:00  37 mg down the hatch\n\nT 0:15 min, I believe I get my first alert.  I doubt this later as it manifests to be a different sensation than what I thought my initial alert would bring and this is much earlier than other reports suggest I should be feeling anything.\n\nT0:30 min  I decide to explore the new neighborhood I just moved into.  I have a go-get 'em attitude, and am happy to face the cold.\n\nT 1:30 min I get my first undeniable drug sensation, whereas the positive vibes and easy energy I felt at T 0:15 was quasi-microdose level definitely could have been placebo.  My jaws are tight, and I notice slight bruxism that takes conceited effort to reduce.  My forehead feels as if a small vacuum has opened up behind my glabella, between my eyes.   I start singing out loud in a very public park, which is something that I do not normally do.  I am reading all of the botanical signs describing the taxonomy and history of the park's diverse array of trees and flora.  A squirrel happily eating an acorn at the base of a Maclura pomifera tree (which has the most intriguing fruit!) stole my attention for easily 15 minutes.\n\nT 2:30 -  I am definitely high, although the sensation is not exactly clear.  I walk through a very busy farmers market without any social anxiety and eye contact isn't bothersome, although it is not bothersome for me when sober (but on LSD, for instance, it would prove a bit embarrassing and difficult).  I feel light and open, but not overwhelmed with any tell-tale empathogenic markers.  I was empathetic, but not on a crippling level (as again, walking around NYC on LSD absolutely tears my heart to pieces when confronted with the abject poverty of the homeless population).  I buy Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus for $7 at a book stand at the farmer's market.\n\nT 3:30 -  I am able to read and easily process Bertrand Russell's preface to the book in a busy cafe waiting on my lunch.  I eat my burrito wolfishly, with no stomach discontent.  The taste was not improved as it would be by cannabis, but there were no strange psychedelic sensations that made eating feel alien.\n\nT 4:30 -  I meet up with some friends from college and we smoke a couple joints on my new apartment's rooftop.  I am very familiar with cannabis and the high certainly brought some 4C-D drug activity to the surface that I wasn't aware of.  I find myself in three conversations at once with my babbling, stoned, group of friends, and remarkably I am able to keep track of everything.  I have the drive to press people on their beliefs without offering my own opinion.  The drive to keep asking is reminiscent of adderall but the Socratic refusal to give answers rather than learn is psychedelic and definitely not notable of amphetamine (I, like many others, have their ego boosted a bit too much on amphetamine).\n\nThe next 3 hours were a gradual comedown.  I smoked cannabis the rest of the evening, with the same vigor as I get at the end of trips, whereas normally consuming this much marijuana would just put me to sleep or make me too slow to be social.  These last 3 hours of my 4C-D experience was more of an altered cannabis high than 4C-D, but notable nonetheless.  Overall VERY synergistic with cannabis.  I never felt like paranoia or any other cannabis side effect was augment by the combination.\n\nI slept very easily at T 13 hours, no disturbances.  I awoke with a slight headache, but I am not sure how connected it is with 4C-D, but something for others to be aware of when reading other reports.  Otherwise fresh and normal.\n\nI am looking to ramp up my dosage level to the \\~120mg level next time.  I definitely enjoyed researching Ariadne at this low of a dose, and can offer nothing but a positive review and strong recommendations to get this rare chem while it is still available on the market.  I've only read a handful of reports (less than a dozen) of researchers using the \\~120mg dosage level.  If anyone has any experience with this level that hasn't posted it to bluelight, erowid, drugs-forum, or here, please let me know your thoughts on it!\n\nI hope everyone has a pleasant day!  \n\n\n(Edits: grammar and coherency) .", "author": "channel4networknews", "score": 75, "flair": null, "created": 1574028384.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/dxmx6f/ariadne4cd_37_mg_report/", "num_comments": 20, "title": "Ariadne/4C-D 37 mg Report", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"f7t928s": {"score": 12, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/dxmx6f/ariadne4cd_37_mg_report/f7t928s/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1574030799.0, "body": "nice report. i tried 135 and 155mg and it was still very light, it feels like a 4 hour long comeup and then it's done. i'd suggest avoiding it unless you have a thing for rare chems (or for Shulgin i guess)\n\nit did pair well with weed though", "replies": {"f7tukok": {"score": 10, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/dxmx6f/ariadne4cd_37_mg_report/f7tukok/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1574036627.0, "body": "While it seems subtle on its own (is this even a shock since 2C-D is so subtle?

Hopefully this doesn\u2019t get buried but I\u2019m mostly just documenting this for myself to look back on in the future and remember. If someone gets something positive from it that\u2019d be pretty dope too.\n\n\nHey guys, first time poster, long time lurker. This trip took place three days ago and I would consider it a disservice to you all if I kept this combo a secret. I found maybe a brief comment or two on it from Reddit but nothing substantial, I got the idea solely from the fact that these were pretty much the only drugs I had around at the time and I was bored. This trip took place in my dorm room, with a good friend of mine trip sitting who we will call Jake. I didn\u2019t record anything while I was tripping, but I remember lemon tekking the mushrooms around 7pm (tastes like legit vomit and I gagged pretty hard) and dropping the 5-MAPB in a gel cap about ~30 minutes later once I started to feel some effects. Trip ended around midnight and I could finally sleep around 2.\n\n\nThe come up was fairly quick, and was your typical shroomy euphoric body high. There was very little depth to my headspace during this time, I just felt pretty silly for a little bit while chillin in my bed watching Futurama, enjoying some mild visuals. As far as the visuals went, I had very little for some reason but YMMV. I sat there suckin down on a disposable vape pen I bought a few days ago that was on its last legs, feeling pretty guilty about it but I\u2019m a fiend for nicotine so whatever. This was nothing to write home about, until that 5-MAPB started to creep up on me. \n\n\nI looked at Jake, and commented about how he needs to put on some weight and take care of himself (not in a dick-ish way, but out of genuine concern). I\u2019m 6\u20195 and 160 lbs though, and we then begun to talk about how I needed to take better care of myself as well. Suddenly, I got out of bed, looked at Jake and said \u201cyou know what? It\u2019s productive trip time\u201d. That was that 5-MAPB stimulation kicking in, completely replacing the lethargy I typically get on mushrooms. My entire mindset shifted immediately, and I began talking about all the things I could do to make myself better. Quit nicotine, eat more/better, exercise, fix my sleep, etc. As we were talking I began to hear \ud83c\udfb5You\u2019re the best around, and nothings ever gonna ever keep you down\ud83c\udfb5 as I look over and see Bender having a training montage on the TV. Jake and I immediately burst out laughing, this entire trip was brimming with these fun little synchronicities that made it feel truly magical.\n\n\nThis trip I truly felt like I was going to change who I was. Not only that, I was going to help my friends improve themselves as well. I was suddenly speaking so fluently and expressing my ideas so beautifully (at least to me) that I felt it would be a waste if I kept it to myself. This never happens to me, I\u2019m a fairly quiet guy overall, especially on psychedelics. It was so profound to me that a \u2018little\u2019 part of me actually started to suspect that maybe I am Jesus reincarnated as I began to speak in drawn out, dramatic as fuck extended metaphors. I got another friend to come over to my dorm and hang out because I wanted to \u201cchange his life\u201d as well. \n\n\nIf you guys want to get a taste of my trippy wisdom at the time, my main thoughts revolved around the idea of me becoming a blank slate after taking all these drugs, and that I would wake up tomorrow to the first day of the rest of my life and that the only thing stopping me from becoming my idealized best-self is simply the learned helplessness I\u2019ve become accustomed to. As far as the actual implementation so far, I smashed my vape with a hammer during the trip which felt good as fuck and haven\u2019t touched nicotine since, with nearly no cravings which is insane because I\u2019ve \u201cquit\u201d nicotine probably eight times already and the first few days were always miserable. I also was comparing the brain to a computer, and my RAM (aka my motivation, focus, whatever) was being utilized ineffectively because I had way too many pointless tasks running at the same time. If I just opened the task manager and closed out all the pointless tasks and focused on each one individually, I could accomplish much more. I have ADHD if you couldn\u2019t tell already. I was thinking about this mostly because when I opened my phone browser I saw I had hundreds of tabs open that were fucking with my browsing. I  also saw I had a lot of porn open too and I was feeling a lot of post-nut-like clarity but without the nut (so just clarity... I guess), and this disgust led me to doing a deep cleaning of anything I deemed impure on my phone. \n\n\nAnyways, my second friend who we\u2019ll call Drew came over and we began having a seminar-like conversation with Jake on how we can work to support one another to become the best people we can possibly be.  This was our own little self-help cult and I was the chosen one. The divinely inspired cult leader. The main idea was that achieving self-actualization is easier when you have friends with similar aspirations there to support you on your journey. I wanted to make a google doc that would contain a list of how we would change our lives, and when I first made one I saw a blank page titled \u201cuntitled document\u201d. This was profound to me apparently because this google doc was just like me, a blank slate. I then shared the empty, untitled google doc with everyone in the room. After that I made a second google doc titled \u201cHow I will change my life\u201d and shared it with them, this would be the actual google doc that we would \u201cchange our lives\u201d with.  If anyone here wants to change their lives, it goes as follows:\n\n1. Sleep at 12\n\n2. Wake at 8\n\n3. Eat\n\n4. Run\n\n5. Meditate\n\nThats it. Basically it would serve as a to-do list for me to follow every morning. I figured if I followed these 5 simple steps then I would naturally become a healthier, happier, more productive person. I haven\u2019t had the chance to actually do this as I\u2019ve been traveling but I will begin this schedule tomorrow and see how things go. Its purpose is to improve me in three ways: mentally, physically, and spiritually. \n\n\nThe trinity of life. \n\n\nAround 10:30pm, my roommate who we\u2019ll call Chad came back to the dorm. He has been good friends with me since high school, but there has always some tension between him and Jake. See, Chad is in a frat and is a very driven, high-energy guy who has a bit of an ego on him and he comes off like a bit of a douche at times. I see a good heart in him though and I know he\u2019s been through a lot of shit and has a lot of demons he\u2019s wrestling with. I got him into microdosing mushrooms recently which has been helping him immensely with working through some problems. When he came in he immediately threw the energy in the room off, coming in saying \u201chow has babysitting stickysalamander been? He looks fucked up his eyes look crazy, has he been causing any problems?\u201d Talking to me like I\u2019m retarded not realizing I\u2019ve handled myself perfectly fine this entire time. Jake and Drew said I was fine and they were legitimately interested in the shit I was saying (it was nothing like a sober person tolerating a tweaker rant for 30 minutes about nothing, I\u2019ve been that sober person to Chad before when he\u2019s off the addy, I tried my best to actively listen to Jake/Drew as much as I spoke as well). I felt like I was Jesus sitting with my disciples, so this kind of energy really put Jake, Drew and I off. They left shortly after and Chad asked if I was fine by myself, I said sure and he then left to go back to his frat. I sat in bed and meditated for a bit alone, feeling clear and content. I was at peace. Sleeping was difficult and Chad came in two hours later pretty drunk, he had a really rough week and just broke down to me. I tried my best to help him, and I imparted on him some insight I gained from my trip about the blank slate. The next day he said that actually helped him a lot when dealing with his issues. \n\n\nI wasn\u2019t even in that bad of a place pre-trip, I\u2019m just underweight, pretty lazy, and dependent on nicotine and adderall. I get out of bed around 11am and don't eat until 1pm. Could be better, could be a lot worse. I am still a college student to be fair and all my classes are online anyway. I can see a lot of therapeutic benefit to this combination though. The emotional depth and introspection of the shrooms combined with the stimulation, empathy, and sociability of the 5-MAPB combined so incredibly well I am still in disbelief. It really did make me feel like Jesus. I felt like I had just been filled with some perfect divine energy unlike any other psychedelic experience I\u2019ve ever had. The comedown over the next few days was minimal and today I feel great. If you feel like you\u2019re stuck and want to make some change, this is a combination I will highly recommend. Change still has to come from within you, and you have to stick with it even when the drugs wear off, but if growth is what you seek with psychedelics give it a try. It was simply just so profound, gentle, and productive I want to sing its praises from the rooftops. Not once did I feel uncomfortable, overwhelmed or go towards any dark place, I was just simply moving from task to task, if I ran out of stuff to say or do, I found something else very quickly and easily. I loved it. We\u2019ll see if it was just the drugs talking or not in the next few days, but something about this trip felt really different. 10/10", "author": "StickySalamander", "score": 95, "flair": null, "created": 1603080900.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/jdne8v/3_grams_of_shrooms_50mg_5mapb_the_most_beneficial/", "num_comments": 21, "title": "3 grams of shrooms + 50mg 5-MAPB = the most beneficial trip of my life thus far", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"g99i3ix": {"score": 11, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/jdne8v/3_grams_of_shrooms_50mg_5mapb_the_most_beneficial/g99i3ix/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1603086366.0, "body": "This is awesome brother!!

Scales have drastically come down in price and gotten better quality in the last 10 years. There is also huge number of different models to choose from now. Scales can be had as low as under $5. Great ones for bit over $10. Good milligram scale for bit over $20.\n\nI like ordering stuff from eBay. It's fun to test out things. In the last 10 years my apartment has been searched countless times by police always resulting in the loss of my scales. I have given away all my scales when I have tried to stop using drugs. I have borrowed scales to a friends in need who never returned it. Or just given away for various reasons.\n\nI have experience of many different scales from varying price brackets. Here are my recommendations. I have nothing to gain from this. Just sharing my experiences to help others.\n\nIn my opinion it's mandatory for everyone to own two scales. You need a quality 0.01g and 0.001g accuracy scales. Scale with 0.1g accuracy is absolutely useless. Never buy such a scale. Price difference to 0.01g scale is not significant. \n\nPeople often recommend the Gemini 20 scale. I think that's a carry over from 10+ years ago when there were no other options. I have owned few and it's no a good scale. No wonder people who own them think small amounts can't be measured even with a milligram scale. \n\n[NEWACALOX 0.001g / 100g. \u00a320 shipped](https://www.ebay.com/itm/NEWACALOX-100-50G-0-001G-Digital-LCD-Jewellery-Weight-Pocket-Scale-USB-Powered/283492700904)\nMilligram scale with 100g max limit. That's a rare sight. Built in battery that is charged with micro-usb. Mine has been on very heavy use for months still going with the first charge. Previous scales that I have owned start to give inaccurate results as batteries run low and the worst thing is when there are no replacement batteries available. This scale is also very accurate when calibrated correctly. I trust the scale accurately measure 10mg doses. But this requires good technique and several measurements to be sure. Under 10mg is still volumetric territory.\n\n[NEWACALOX 0.01g / 500g. \u00a310 shipped](https://www.ebay.com/itm/NEWACALOX-500g-x-0-01g-Electronic-Jewelry-Scale-USB-Powered-Digital-LCD-Display/283511893121)\nSmaller brother of the previous scale with 0.01g accuracy and 500g limit. Built in battery and all that other goodness.\n\n[Small portable pocket-able scale 0.01g / 100g. \u00a35 shipped](https://www.ebay.com/itm/163779457902)\nTo carry with me when I need. All other scales that don't have the cover permanently attached with hinges suck. Cover gets loose and the scale gets damaged in backpack. This one is accurate enough for everybody's needs. Just note that cheaper scales are not at their best in the low end. So measure with extra weight like the cup you are going to put powder in.\n\n---\n\nHuge thanks to /u/cookiej0e, /u/hexachoron, /u/GammaMT and everyone else in the comments!

Not a drug amateur.", "replies": {}}}}}}, "f53q3x": {"text": "Hello all.\n\nAfter doing a pretty useless review on a popular RC, I decided to do a more interesting review on an extremely rare RC: Homomazindol\n\n**tl;dr:** Mildly stimulating, long acting chem that offers a little bit of an energy boost and increased focus. Much weaker than 4f-MPH or 3-FPM and only functional.\n\nI have searched the internet long and far for any experience reports on this substance to no avail. I saw one thread on the substance on Bluelight and one thread on a German RC forum. Still, nobody was willing to actually purchase the product and try it. Homomazindol is based off the drug mazindol, which is a sympathomimetic amine and is supposed to be similar to amphetamine and other popular CNS stimulants. Mazindol is used to treat obesity (like phentermine) at a dose of around 2mg. Homomazindol is estimated to be 30x-40x more potent than mazindol so the dose could be in the sub-milligram range. Because there are no reports of human use, and the dose might be extremely small, I am proceeding with extreme caution. It looks like I might be one of the first to try this substance.\n\n[Mazindol and its homologs Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazindol)\n\nIll save your time by summarizing the boring trial and error of dosing:\n\n1mg - No Effects\n\n2mg - No Effects\n\n5mg - No Effects\n\n10mg - Slight caffeine-like stimulation noticed. Maybe Placebo\n\n**First Noticeable Experience:**\n\n**T+00:00 -** I added 20mg to a cup of decaf coffee at 7:30AM and drank it all in about a minute. The homomazindol is not soluble and a suspension is made to the best of my ability. I am feeling extremely groggy and nodding off as I usually am in the morning.\n\n**T+00:15 -** I am still feeling very sleepy.\n\n**T+00:30 -** I am still very sleepy. The caffeinated coffee usually has me awake by now.\n\n**T+01:00 -** I am pretty much awake now on my own and not because of the special home brew.\n\n**T+02:00 -** I have arrived at work. There is a distinct stimulation feeling like a strong shot of espresso. It feels like its already noon and I am focused at my desk.\n\n**T+03:00 -** The stimulation has grown a bit more. There are no what most consider recreational effects like euphoria, talkativeness, or increased perception just functional stimulation. I have been working non-stop at my desk. I am dreading the afternoon meetings because I want to keep working. I have said literally all of two words (good morning) to my friend who sits by me because I am so focused. I usually chat and slack off with her the whole day.\n\n**T+06:00 -** Stimulation has decreased slightly but is still useful to doing my work. I have pretty bad urinary retention and have been making countless bathroom trips and only being able to pee literally half a cup each time.\n\n**T+12:00 -** I am home and completely sober. I was not able to update during the afternoon meetings. The stimulation slowly trailed off from about 1PM to 3PM. There is not really much of a comedown as the effects are so gentle and mild. I had no real compulsion to redose (didn't bring the RC to work anyway). Also I didn't really ramble or talk fast too much in the meetings which I though might happen.\n\nA few days later I tried 30mg at home and felt about 30% more stimulation/energy.\n\n**Consensus:** This stuff is pretty mild. All the cathinone/pyro RC stim users might compare this stuff to caffeine. Some people who use 3-FPM and 4F-MPH for functional purposes might get value out of this chem, however 3-FPM and 4F-MPH are also definitely more potent than homomazindol. This stuff is purely functional and nothing else. With an oral ROA, it seems to take a while to kick in, but lasts pretty long. What is nice about this chem is that it does not have the common side effects associated with stims such as jaw clenching, clammy hands, sweating, and crappy comedowns. The chem feels very clean and pharmaceutical. For me though, I would still prefer adderall, 4F-MPH, or anything stronger. This stuff might be good for people with addiction issues.", "author": "sandymouseguy", "score": 55, "flair": null, "created": 1581945383.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/f53q3x/homomazindol_experience_report/", "num_comments": 20, "title": "Homomazindol Experience Report", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fhwk66y": {"score": 10, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/f53q3x/homomazindol_experience_report/fhwk66y/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1581947243.0, "body": "Interesting structure.

For the record I haven't really done many RC's to my knowledge, I pretty much just stick to regular ol drugs. \n\nThat being said my drug use has changed as I've gotten older. I'm near 30 now, and cocaine is more prevalent among my circle of friends than it has ever been before. I myself have used coke off and on, honestly, for the past 5 or 6 years, with usage intensifying over the past two years in late 2017 (although for most of 2018 I didn't use it). Lately the usage has gotten quite heavy by my standards, using it multiple times a week, often daily. \n\nI've pretty much made the decision to quit...but that's easier said than done. One can realize that one's drug abuse is detrimental and that quitting would be beneficial, and yet still decide to do the drug because it feels good, satisfies cravings, and provides an escape from the negative emotions often caused by modern life.\n\nAll that being said I'm wondering if there are any legitimate safer alternatives to cocaine. Specifically drugs that provide a similar euphoric high but with much less cardiotoxicity. I've never overdosed or anything, but comedowns off coke really freak me out, every single time for at least an hour or two after my last line I end up worrying about my heart rate, random little pains here and there that come and go. It's to the point I'm basically deciding to quit because it just isn't that enjoyable anymore. IMO coke is really only good to do when partying/drinking and doing the occasional bump for a pick me up. Anything more than that and the negatives seem to outweigh the positives for me. \n\nSo, is there anything else that would be a less cardiotoxic substitute? I've thought about just taking the occasional adderall again, which I haven't done since college really, but I know amphetamines aren't really the same. I like coke for the euphoria specifically, the energy wakeup is just a nice bonus imo.

Some somewhat healthier things (for lack of better terms) I would look into if your simply looking for a stash would be any methylphenidate(Ritalin) analogue reason being they have been studied for replacing cocaine addiction as they have the same mechanism of action (NDRI, with minimal serotonin activity) and thus give you that dopamine push you crave at that moment. However the euphoria is something that is lackluster for most and re dosing comes with more negatives than positives. Also some of these analogues such as, 4F-MPH and 3,4-CTMP have much longer durations (6-8hrs and 12-18hrs respectively). Something like IPPH or 4M-MPH would be more suited to what your looking for as these last about 2-4hours. 2-FMA also comes to mind however this one may be cardiotoxic/neurotoxic so do your research.\n \n  I'd reccomend staying away from most cathinones as these tend to make you fiend harder than coke, at least in my experience, and you turn into a Gollum-esque creature holding the bag and pipe like it's \"your precious\". Also binging will lead to psychosis much easier than most other substances out there. \n\n  Another thing to consider is giving dissos a try, the effects are nothing like cocaine however they could provide you with some serious introspection and help you understand and accept where the root of your emotional distress may be coming from. They are a 'wonky' experience to say the least but have provided me the most benefit in my life as far as my drug use goes.\n\n  As far as supplements for helping the lack of energy and motivation you'll experience when quitting: A good multivitamin if your not already taking it that is, fish oil/COQ10 these both help cardiovascular health, Magnesium (everyone should take it as most are lacking based off the American diet), Turmeric which will help with both inflammation and personally gave me a mood boost and sense of well being, most importantly IMHO would be Tyrosine/NAC/B-Vitamin complex as these will all help naturally boost your dopamine levels and help replenish those depleted receptors.\n\nI won't go into lifestyle changes as you know yourself better than I ever will but something as simple as working out made such a massive difference in not only how I felt but how I thought. I'm no gym rat or anything like that and used to laugh at people that said they got a buzz from it, however that whole runners high isn't a myth. After a long run and pushing yourself your body naturally releases all those feel good chemicals and it's like being in a state of pure bliss for a solid 10-15 minutes.", "replies": {}}}}}}, "ffpvhi6": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/euk59a/are_there_any_truly_safe_drugs_besides_cannabis/ffpvhi6/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1580136076.0, "body": "basically what I've found for coke substitutes are things like 3-cmc or 3mmc and a few others.

A within-subject study was performed to characterize the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of oral cocaine. Fourteen healthy inpatient participants (six males) with current histories of cocaine use were administered two oral doses (100 and 200 mg) and one intravenous (IV) dose (40 mg) of cocaine during three separate dosing sessions. Plasma samples were collected for up to 24 h after dosing and analyzed for cocaine and metabolites by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by non-compartmental analysis, and a two-factor model was used to assess for dose and sex differences. The mean \u00b1 SEM oral cocaine bioavailability was 0.32 \u00b1 0.04 after 100 and 0.45 \u00b1 0.06 after 200 mg oral cocaine. Volume of distribution (Vd) and clearance (CL) were both greatest after 100 mg oral (Vd = 4.2 L/kg; CL = 116.2 mL/\\[min kg\\]) compared to 200 mg oral (Vd = 2.9 L/kg; CL = 87.5 mL/\\[min kg\\]) and 40 mg IV (Vd = 1.3 L/kg; CL = 32.7 mL/\\[min kg\\]). Oral cocaine area-under-thecurve (AUC) and peak concentration increased in a dose-related manner. AUC metabolite-to-parent ratios of benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester were significantly higher after oral compared to IV administration and highest after the lower oral dose. In addition, minor metabolites were detected in higher concentrations after oral compared to IV cocaine. Oral cocaine produced a pharmacokinetic profile different from IV cocaine, which appears as a rightward and downward shift in the concentration\u2013time profile.

This report is of the first time ever using 2-FA. Cheers!\n\n---\nThis is the beginning of my 2-FA trip report. I will record anything of note as the high goes on. My focus will be on the difference between 2-FA and regular racemic amphetamines. As for the chem itself, the appearance is a completely white very fine powder that smells slightly of citrus. It tastes like normal amphetamines I've had before but with a hint of old oranges. Not the most pleasant taste but it's not so bad. \n\nFor note, I will be using 50mg salt nic juice in my vape throughout. This may alter the effects of the drug so take that into consideration if you choose to research this chem yourself.\n\n6:22 dosed 30mg orally, I mixed the powder into a third of a shot glass of water and drank it. Empty stomach except for liquids. When mixed with water it doesn't taste much like citrus as I was kind of expecting, instead it tastes just like normal amp when mixed with water. \nTotal ingested: 30mg\n\n6:45pm I'm beginning to feel it, a little buzz in the front of my brain.\n\n7:30pm it's completely kicked in now. I feel good, calm and collected. My mind is rather clear and thinking is easy. There is a buzz a few inches behind my eyes, but nothing major. My body feels lighter, easier to move. Wakefulness is increased but not significantly, I feel like I could probably go to bed if I wanted to but I don't. I feel focused. I'm playing mincecraft with my girlfriend and I feel motivated to build and to finish projects I gave up on in previous sessions. \n\nHonestly this feels exactly like I took an Adderall. \n\n7:45pm mixed another 25mg into water in the shot glass and drank it. For note, when I add the powder to the water most of it dissolves very quickly but there is a few specks left at the bottom each time. These specks are hard to the touch and I think it's just where the powder has rocked up naturally. They dissolve very slowly, so I am drinking the water then getting the specks with my finger and eating them. \nTotal ingested: 55mg\n\nI am loading up guild wars 2, as I expect this high will go very nicely with such a game. \n\n8:00pm guild wars 2 is updating, so I'm listening to music. Wow, this stuff is good for music appreciation. Loaded up my stims playlist, which is mostly edm, and the bass is making me very happy. I've taken about the equivalent of two Adderall and music sounds significantly better than it does on Adderall. I'm being drawn into the beats!\n\nSide note, if you like listening to music on stims I suggest listening to some music by S3RL. They are Happy Hardcore and their sound is perfect for stims imo. Smooth but heavy. Very nice. Here's one of my favorite songs by them: https://youtu.be/rCz3dK_F_Bc\n\n8:24pm my girlfriend's phone case is breaking, and she just gave me a piece of it to chew. Oh boy does chewing feel good. I prefer to chew with my front teeth on stims. Now, I don't feel like I *need* to chew, I'm not gurning or grinding as far as I can tell, but chewing feels great. She also suggested I listen to The Real World by Owl City, and it was a damn good suggestion. It sounds magical and the bass is perfect for this high.\n\n9:12pm starting to come down from the peak of the first dose, I have decided now is the time to test boofing. I have prepared 2ml of water and added 56mg of 2fa and stirred until dissolved. \nTotal ingested: 111mg\n\nThis stuff is definitely more caustic than normal amp, I can feel it burning a bit in my anus. It's not that bad, but I think it needs a bit more water. Next time I will use 3-4ml of water instead of 2. \n\n9:57pm well boofing is nice but not as intense as normal amp, could be an absorbtion difference or something. I feel very awake and energetic, but still quite calm. Just realized I haven't been monitoring my heart rate, but honestly going just based on how i feel it doesn't seem to be significantly raised. This is normal for me on amphetamines, my hr actually lowers by about 10bpm from my normal resting rate when I'm on amp.\n\n11:00pm more boofing. This time I'm taking it up a notch, 95mg. It definitely burns. Hopefully I'm not harming my butt. It only seems to burn for about 5-10 minutes, and doesn't seem sensitive after that. I used 3ml water this time.\n\n11:09pm okay I really feel this dose coming on, didn't have much of a rush the first time but this time there is. Must be dose dependant. \nTotal ingested: 206mg\n\nThe way I feel hasn't changed much, maybe this dose will change that.\n\n11:41pm I feel pretty damn great not gonna lie. Energized, a bit euphoric but not a lot, about the same amount as regular amphetamines. It's a bit different though, I feel more cuddly and warm in my core than usual. Possible seratonin action? Placebo? Not sure. \n\nI really wish I could snort this stuff... I said I wouldn't but I might try it. My snorting kit is missing but I can use a straw. I'll have to see. I don't want to hurt my nose you know.\n\n1:36am I have decided against snorting it, and thus have boofed once more. 100mg in 3ml of water. This time I stirred it and crushed the specks with the oral syringe I'm using to boof until it was completely dissolved. Boofing it doesn't seem to be causing any harm to my booty, once the initial burn is gone there's no sensitivity or other signs of damage. That being said doing it for days or weeks on end probably would hurt the lining of the badonkadonk.  I feel confident and self assured. Like I could complete projects I have and focus on anything necessary.\nTotal ingested: 306mg\n\nI think I will go into a bit more detail about the boofing experience. There is a rush but it's mild, at least with redoses. The whole time it feels really smooth and easy, a little smoother than regular amphetamines that I've had. Although it's likely that the amp I've had in the past was cut with active chemicals that made it a different experience. I've been taking higher and higher doses and I haven't had any kind of overstimulation or any negative side effects at all, unlike regular amp where if i dosed too frequently I would feel overstimulated and anxious. The main side effect of boofing this is the feeling that I need to take a shit every time, but I get that boofing any stimulant. I feel like I could easily go all night and have no problems. The question is, what is the comedown like? I'll have to see when I stop dosing.\n\n1:51am at this point I would like to make note that nicotine feels pretty damn good on this, but it always does on stims so that's not surprising. It feels especially good when I'm coming up on a dose. Any of you who use nicotine probably understand what I mean, and those of you who don't probably aren't interested in that aspect. So I shall refrain from going into detail.\n\n3:40am I just realized how good my body feels. The physical euphoria is really nice, I'm not sure how I didn't notice it before. However it does feel a lot like dextroamphetamine. A little different, in that I feel warmer than usual. Usually on amp I feel rather cold and while my hands and feet feel cold from vasoconstriction my insides feel warm and fuzzy. Idk I'm no scientist but it feels that at high doses there is some seratonin action. Not a whole lot, I'm not exactly rolling over here, but it's fuzzier than regular amp at high doses and much more calming than what I've had before. I'm so calm in fact that despite being significantly stimulated I feel like I can lay down and rest, if not sleep. I don't plan on going to sleep yet though as I am accompanying my girlfriend to work for a short time at 5 am. I will take one more dose of 100mg before I go. \n\n4:00am probably the last dose of this trip report is 116mg boofed in 3ml of water.\nTotal ingested: 422mg \n\n4:03am I already feel the rush this time. I think the first time I boofed it just wasn't a high enough dose to cause a rush. I'm beginning to feel a little sleepy, which is good cause I wanna sleep when my girlfriend and I get home if possible. The physical euphoria is so relaxing. It's like being wrapped in a warm blanket. Or maybe that's the blanket I'm wrapped in. Either way, quite relaxing and very nice. By the way it doesn't seem to be burning as bad this time. Maybe I'm getting used to it? \n\nI haven't mentioned this before but time is going pretty slowly, until it suddenly isn't and it's been like an hour. Not sure if it has to do with me focusing on stuff or not. I've been on 2-FA for almost 12 hours but it feels like shorter, and longer at the same time. \n\n4:25am I've noticed I'm having \"hangs\" where I'll be doing something and suddenly stop and zone out for a few minutes then snap back and continue like I hadn't stopped. This happens a bit on normal amp but it seems to be happening more often on this. Could be a coincidence, or it could be that the amp I've had before was impure (it 100% was) and the higher doses of pure chem is causing the hangs. \n \n---\nFootnotes\n\nIt ends there because I got busy and didn't write any more, but I continued to redose throughout the next day until about 6pm. So I dosed for a solid 24 hours. That night as I was coming down I celebrated my birthday and drank and smoked weed with friends, which made me not even notice the stim comedown so I don't really know what that is like. However in the past with regular amphetamines after a 24 hour session the comedown was pretty bad for me despite doing things like drinking and smoking. So the comedown might be a little easier on 2-fa, but it's definitely inconclusive. \n\nSnorting was not included in this report because I simply didn't try it at the time of writing. Everything I read said not to snort it, so I needed that warning. However now I have decided to try it once, and snorted 45mg. I can confirm that the other info saying not to snort. No bloody nose or anything, but it feels the same as oral to me except it kicked in about 10-15 minutes faster than oral. My nose and throat are now sensitive as well. \n\nThank you for reading!

It\u2019s likely dehydration but I\u2019ve been very mindful of my water intake, and never experienced anything like it with other stimulant misuse.

It is the gold standard for functional stimulants.\n\nI want to take a different tack with this post and discuss some of the caveats that come with its use.\n\n1. **I suspect that recent batches have dropped significantly in purity.** Even just a couple years ago the most commonly suggested dose range for 2-FMA was 15-30mg and going over 60mg was seen as pointless and wasteful. Now I regularly see people posting about taking *starting* doses of 50mg and being disappointed. People should be concerned, what's in that extra 30mg?\n\n2. **I've personally experienced persistent side-effects from regular use.** There was a ~6 week period where I was taking 20mg 2-FMA 4-5x/week to treat my ADHD. This was one of the most productive periods of my life, but eventually a couple side effects developed that made me halt use. The first was a persistent twitch in my left eyelid that became more and more prominent. A week after that started, I began developing a strange sensation in my left leg, like static shooting up my shin while walking or pressing on my foot. This went from nothing to extremely uncomfortable within two days. After halting use the foot sensation slowly improved and was gone 5 days later. There was no change in the eye twitch until one day it suddenly stopped, almost two weeks after taking the last 2-FMA dose. Based on this and the long duration of primary effects I suspect that 2-FMA may produce some sort of potentially harmful long-lasting metabolites.\n\n3. **Chasing euphoria with 2-FMA is doing it wrong.** 2-FMA shines as a functional stimulant but is not particularly recreational. The ceiling is quite low and most people will really have to push to excessive doses. It *can* be used that way, like a screwdriver can be used for a hammer in a pinch. But if you're trying to build a house, just go buy a fucking hammer already.\n\n4. **There is some evidence that FMAs may be neurotoxic similar to regular methamphetamine.** The comments on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/i6tzbb/3fma_produces_dopaminergic_neurotoxicity_similar/) have more detailed discussion, but it appears that, on some measures of neurotoxicity, 3-FMA appears to have effects similar to meth. 3-FMA is not 2-FMA, but it's close enough that people should be aware of the possibility. At low doses this shouldn't be a huge problem, meth is even prescribed at low doses as an ADHD medication.

First off I take 150mg lamotrigine and 450mg bupropion daily (all experience reports should include what meds the researcher takes daily). I've tried *plenty* of stims before this so I knew what to expect before going in. My stimulant tolerance may be fairly high due to the daily bupropion. And there were no other drugs in my system (besides daily meds and THC metabolites) when I trialed 2-FMA. I am taking this chemical for functional usage so that's my review criteria for this chemical. \n\nOk so here's my thoughts. Today was my first time trying out 2-FMA, I dosed 20mg orally in a gelcap. The comeup was incredibly subtle, very gradual, probably 45 minutes after first alerts to peak effects which very is nice for a functional stim IMO.\n\nDespite the similarity in structure, 2-FMA feels nothing like methamphetamine. It's an extremely smooth, easygoing stimulation. I've heard the Vyvanse comparison, and I have to say it does fit pretty closely, but honestly? It's kinda better than Vyvanse. Don't get me wrong, I *loooove* me some dextroamphetamine, but there's definitely a pushy edge of euphoria that comes with it that definitely lessens it's functionality. 2-FMA however (at least at lower doses) certainly gives you the \"awake and alert\" feeling that comes with traditional stims, but it feels.... super relaxed. No pushy stimulation at all, it's really hard to describe it actually.\n\nIt's definitely stimulating, don't get me wrong, but it does a really good job of staying in the background so to speak. Usually when I take a stimulant like say the mixed amphetamine salts in Adderall, I get pretty on edge, looking for stuff to do, very fluid feeling, fast thoughts etc etc. But 2-FMA woke me up and gave me focus and energy without it ever feeling pushy or forced. Usually when I'm on a stim I'll generally avoid people because I get anxious that I'll look and act like I'm on something. But I was able to just hang out with my mom and watch TV and talk like normal. Granted I definitely felt stimulated, but there was no anxiety like with other stims (potentially meaning some serotonergic activity?)\n\nI was able to focus on a task for extended amounts of time and not get fatigued with the work, but then be able to stop working when I was finished. Usually when I hunker down and start chugging through work on a stimulant It'll be the only thing I do for the rest of the day, blowing through lessons until I'm nearly a week ahead and then crashing in spectacular fashion. 2-FMA lets me move away from working when I'm finished with something, which is really nice and lets me get a wider variety of things done/not work myself to exhaustion.\n\nIt does last quite long however, I dosed around 10:00AM this morning and still feel a reduced yet noticable degree of stimulation as I write this (which you probably already knew given the length of this post XD). This has me a little worried about getting to sleep tonight, but I have an ace up my sleeve in the form of some heavy indica kush. Appetite suppression is pretty par for the course with 2-FMA, no desire to eat. Although I keep protein shakes stocked for this exact situation, as they're great for getting the calories/nutrients you need and it's much easier to get down than solid food.\n\nComedown so far has been incredibly gentle. No grumpiness, mental fatigue, exhaustion, body aches etc. Appetite is slowly starting to reappear as well. Again, only thing I'm worried about is the residual stimulation messing with my sleep, and I will definitely be in a bad mood tomorrow if I'm not able to.\n\nOverall I'd give 2-FMA an 9/10 in terms of functionality. Not tweaky at all, no forced stimulation feeling, little to no euphoria (although definite mood enhancement), easy comedown, long duration. Mmm mmm good. It's like meth's cousin that decided to go to business school, get a degree and start a middle management job at a tech company. Boring, but incredibly functional and polished. I'd say it makes for a fantastic Vyvanse replacement and could even be considered superior in some areas. I would love to see some receptor binding affinities for this chemical as the only thing that has me worried is it's potential to agonize the 5HT2B receptor which would lead to cardiotoxicity. I only worry about this as 5HT2B agonism is a trait that many halogenated amphetamines share. And given 2-FMA's relaxing properties, it probably means it has some degree of serotonergic action which could then imply some degree of affinity for the 5HT2B receptor. All conjecture at this point though.\n\nAnyways that sums it up, if you have any thoughts/comments/experiences *please* post them below as the more experiences we can draw from the better insights we'll have regarding 2-FMA.", "author": "Strangetimer", "score": 49, "flair": null, "created": 1600763739.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/ixd1ws/very_impressed_with_2fma_review/", "num_comments": 15, "title": "Very impressed with 2-FMA (review)", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"g67bkr5": {"score": 6, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ixd1ws/very_impressed_with_2fma_review/g67bkr5/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1600801769.0, "body": "2-fma is an amazing chem, it's been my go to functional stim since like 2011 and have always recommended it to people looking for a functional stim.\n\nExtremely clean and smooth, much better than even regular amph for functionality imo since for me theres basically no crash/come down with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeen enjoying the stuff close to a decade now, sometimes it goes in and out of phases where it can be a lil hard to find but usually it's pretty available.", "replies": {"g67v6mv": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ixd1ws/very_impressed_with_2fma_review/g67v6mv/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1600814911.0, "body": "Great that it works so well for you!

Hopefully this isn\u2019t too unfriendly to folks new to research. \n\nI have already done ton of learning about general safety tips for RC\u2019s (correct dosing measurements using proper tools, allergy tests, etc.), but can\u2019t find a ton of Harm Reduction information for this specific chemical. 5\u20196\u201d male, around 155-160lbs who has a decently high tolerance to Stims (past methamphetamine addiction, daily dosing of 40mg\u2019s Amphetamine/Dextroamphetamine in the form of Adderall XR, spontaneous use of Methylphenidate, Adrafinil, and multiple times a week use of lower doses of DXM, which forgive me if I\u2019m incorrect but I believe has some stimulating properties in lower doses, even though it\u2019s not it\u2019s a stimulant itself). \n\nI understand that it is unsafe to mix any new substances with any other, however I am also a daily Phenibut user/addict, with a once daily dose of 2 grams. I am currently unable to go without this, but everything else I will avoid with 3-FPM.\n\nWhat would be, in your opinion, a good dose to start with? The use of stims is primarily to get through day to day life and work, as without them functioning is impossible. I also enjoy whatever euphoria can still be obtained at this point from Stims, so a good mix of euphoria (if any) 3-FPM can give, and functionality. If this isn\u2019t really a euphoric substance, at least a general mood lift or sense of well being would be good if possible. What kind of effects can expected? General Stimulant effects, is it close to any substances listed above, or is it a completely different experience?What can be expected as far as a duration in general, duration of euphoria/mood lift, and duration of general stimulation. Is the comedown rough, and are there any after effects once the experience ends? I understand Duration is largely based on dose and ROA, so my final question is what is the recommended, or best in your experience, ROA? I\u2019m open to oral, sublingual, intranasal, and vaporization, however no interest in IM or IV use. \n\nI apologize for the wall of text, just want to try to be as prepared and safe as possible. Also, any recommendations on any other RC stims that are worth a try? I\u2019m in the US, so I know a lot of the better ones are not obtainable for me, so anything I can get that\u2019s worth a shot I\u2019m more than open to!

Stims I've had:*** Coke, Adderall (XR and IR), Meth, some A-P?P chem, 3-FPM, and IPPH so far (Along with Caffeine and Nicotine before obviously lol).\n\nSo last week I acquired 1g of 4F-MPH and it's much like what most reports that I've read. And honestly it's amazing. I take \\~100-150mg Caffeine (1:2 w/ L-Theanine) with about 15mg of 4F and I'm feeling awake with a pretty good sense of euphoria. \n\nI'm just curious about everyone else's opinion about this drug. I believe it's the best analogue of Methylphenidate, but since I've never tried Ritalin to gather a baseline, I can't honestly say for sure. But, compared to IPPH, 4F definitely has much more euphoria and duration even after taking it daily for the past 5 days so far. \n\nWhen I first tried a Phenidate it was only IPPH and I absolutely loved to take it before a long 3-hour class since it seemed you got euphoria from being productive on that chemical in particular. I would get some euphoria from ingestion, but it seems that it would mainly **enhance** things that'd normally make me happy like *'getting important stuff that I'd have on my mind done'* as one. It was an interesting chem, but still had that smooth feeling like what low to moderate doses of Amphetamine or IPPH can give you.\n\nI do have to say that Psychonautwiki was right on point for one of the cognitive side-effects. It **does** have this emotion-blunting like effect. Kind of like when I took benzos for an extended period of time. My emotions became blunt.

Deviated to show my use of different opioids to compare then. Skip to the end for a quick dosage guide for high-moderate opioid tolerance for someone who's never done anything stronger than Mboxs back in college before presses.\n\nI have an opioid addiction that comes and goes depending on if I'm Kratom. I live in a state where kratoms illegal. I'm moving to Chicago for access to kratom and weed. I've been dabbling with opioids since middle school and never had an addiction until I quit alcohol in 2017. I'm three years sober off that and I've been hooked on Tianeptine Sodium twice since that. At 3gpd my WD was bad but not terrible like people have reported. This was mainly due to helper meds.\n\nAs of now I'm cycling 2map, Ethyl-Tianeptine-i and O-DSMT. Some side effects and long term dangers of 2map make me wanna remove it. I'm gonna try my hardest but now it's hooks are in me.\n\nThe first part is to show my personal knowledge of Tianeptine dosage. I've personally been using this product sparingly since I discovered it in March. More often recently as part of the cycle. It's billed as 5x stronger. It easily feels like 6x because of my medium tolerance and the doses it takes for me to get effects.\n\nFor chronic pain, addiction, I recommend getting the solution for ease of dosing it's 30mg 750mg with 1ml=25mg. I've read it's less serotinergic than Tianeptine Sodium. That checks out. I still recommend cycling with O-DSMT, or if you're on something like Etazene to keep you well until your Etazene arrives. Personally I'm hoping to flood myself with 25x kratom extract when I move to Chicago in a week so I don't have to keep swapping out opioid/mu agonist RCs, but you do you.\n\nSince my tolerance is a bit jacked, the dosages and effects seem more like 6x, but it may be 5x and just hits harder and makes the pain go away. I jacked myself up straining hastening to finish an art project in an awkward position, right before packing and moving heavy boxes. I also have chronic pain and would use kratom and RCs to manage strain at work since 2017. When working at a soul food restaurant I occasionally would be gifted perc 5s and 7.5s from the best cook so I could keep up. I would still fall behind from pain, also pregaming with gabs, and taking 2map (90mg oral capsule) before and during work. Part of this for mood, since I had specific work stressors working with felons at an affordable fine dining establishment deep in the giant hood in a poor ass city--as the only white boy. Crazy shit would go down--wanna know, ask in comments, digressed enough, a few white girls worked there too but 90% ghetto black folks. Cooking at the deli was less stressful (Covid switch) was mainly 2map (50mg before and on break) gabs, and Canadian NSAIDS with methocarbamol. I had been mainly off of Tianeptine Sodium during this period due to cost and extra serotinergic action. Ethyl-Tianeptine-i is less serotinergic, in a similar way that O-DSMT is less serotinergic than tramadol. We need PKs only FFS it'll automatically help mood.\n\n  So Tianeptine Sodium since 2017. I've used kratom since 2012--i have chronic gout pain and cheat because beef and shellfish trigger it but are delicious. If clams and oysters count as shellfish I cheated yesterday without thinking. I think it does from pain. I was dosing 2map pretty often before lunch hoping my Ethyl-Tianeptine-i would arrive saving my last 50mg 2map dose in case it didn't arrive. Took it immediately after lunch as that all over pain was returning.\n\nSo back to dosing. 25mg=1ml and it's 5-6x stronger than sodium. I don't ever take as little as 1ml and I don't divide mls until the bottom of the bottle. For my high--moderate tolerance to PKs I took 2ml--50mg (250--300mg sodium equivalent). Pain returned 4hrs later and took night meds (1mg kpin 600mg Gabs 5mg Olanzapine) along with 3ml--75mg (375mg-450mg) and got pain relief and the calming warmth. 3hrs later it was late and I wanted to go to sleep so I took 4ml with 300mg F-Phenibut. I regret that because I only got 4hrs sleep and woke up in a P-but fog and have been having sleep issues. Couldn't get back to sleep, fog disappeared with 10mg Adderall and 50mg N-methyl-cyclazodone which also motivated this post. Seeing Dr. soon specifically for liver and kidney function and to establish PCP in Chicago. As for cost, a bottle is very affordable. I always get F-Phenibut or N-methyl-cyclazodone to hit $50 and free UPS delivery. With rewards program and Bitcoin discount it's kicked down to $38 with the bonus chem. I need that delivery because it's one day as I'm somewhat local\n\nTl:Dr Major takeaways. It lasts an hour longer than Tianeptine Sodium, it's less serotinergic, making it more appealing and cleaner, and with more traditional effects.\n\nQuick guide for those currently on RC Opioids\n25mg--too mild\n50mg--mild/moderate\n75mg--high--moderate\n100mg--high\n\nIf no tolerance then divide all these by 2. Don't take this as gospel YMMV.\n\nEdit: I'm not sure I oversold it or not. It had the \"Everything Hurts\" pain under control until I took 40mg Adderall 50mg of N-Methyl-Cyclazodone then 20mg Dexedrine and of course all my muscles hurt like hell. Didn't wanna keep redosing it. Naproxen doesn't touch it. Instead when I took a 75mg dose I also took a half-o of kratom. Did that 2hrs ago and I feel great. Good combo. Boosted mood too, which is weird because Kratom has some antagonists in it. I think it's because since I've been on these I haven't had any Kratom at all so the tolerance to the plant dropped to zero.", "author": "StoopSign", "score": 21, "flair": null, "created": 1602877343.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/jc8ak1/ethyltianeptinei_review/", "num_comments": 14, "title": "Ethyl-Tianeptine-i Review", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"g9000vl": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/jc8ak1/ethyltianeptinei_review/g9000vl/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1602883408.0, "body": "Is this the same as Tianeptine Ethyl Ester Sulfate?", "replies": {"g905bff": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/jc8ak1/ethyltianeptinei_review/g905bff/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1602886489.0, "body": "No. It's something like iodo-ester-ethyl Tianeptine or some shit.

It almost feels like a hangover and it made me dislike tripping somewhat. Etizolam and benzos for me is a powerful tool, but I think it should really only be used like a tool would. It's not a party drug, it's a chill out/ knock out drug that should really only be used for super uncomfortable experiences. Like say, if you were having a bad trip, coming down from a challenging trip or a stim experience. It shouldn't invade your everyday life, I just think thats were problems emerge. Be wary of any drug that you feel compelled to do frequently. I don't like seeing people get hurt from this stuff. Part of these experiences should be about figuring why you do substances and like where enoughs enough. Breaks are good for you. Accidents happen. Treat yourself like you would a loved one that sorta kinda contrived stuff.

From what i read they are good at giving motivation and sustain focus. More so that I struggle with the capacity of maintaining a sustained concentration while doing something.\n\nSo i tried... \n\nIPPH : a bit lackluster, something is not there and it just gives me a little bit more focus than usual. Maybe the smoother one. \n\n2-fma: clean stimulation, but a part of me is always wanting to reach more euphoria which this compound does not give. And the durtion is too long for me.\n\nSo i turned to 2-fa which looks like some proper adderall replacement. From all those that i have tried it's the cleanest, and the duration is good for my purpose (no need to be stimulated for hours while being productive, i prefer to redose if necessary).\n\nOh and i also tried 4f-mph, which was very uncomfortable for me. Lot's of peripheral stimulation and a bit of anxiety, even at low dose. \n\nOn paper they all looked promising, but sincerely I'm not doing better while on them. I just feel a forced stimulation which is not comfortable and gets me away fom my purpose. \n\nI would have hoped that they bring me just the right amount of motivation and focus to do what i want to do (learning, and programming).

Because if so I may preload with .5-1mg etiz if that sounds like a decent idea?\n\nI'm roughly 6' tall, 68kg, for reference on the succinate dosing. Its a very recent batch from NL, fairly light in color, a hint of brown but mostly white. \n\nOnto the effects I am feeling... very slight euphoria, as if I took maybe 20mg IR Adderall, mind is very mildly psychedelic in feel, like a low threshold dose of some shrooms.

Or so everyone says - people have had decent experiences with oral dosing, but I just like the way it vapes too much.\n\n**The Effects:** It feels surprisingly clean and euphoric at fairly low doses. I've found it to help me stay focused and motivated for the most part, although later in the experience, that stimmed energy becomes considerably less focused. There's a body euphoria with it as well, with that nice tingly feeling. I find that it actually reduces my libido, and it has never led me into a porn binge or anything of that nature.\n\nThe peak comes on quickly when vaped and lasts about an hour. Positive effects and stimulation are still present for much longer - approximately four hours, varying with dose. I can usually sleep six hours after the last time I vape it in a day.\n\nFor me, less is more with this stuff. It's about finding the right dose to feel nicely euphoric without anxiety or annoying negative effects. Higher doses mostly increase the negatives for me. I don't feel overly compelled to redose constantly, and I haven't gone nights without sleeping because of it.\n\n**Dose:** I went through about 20 mg/day average in an ecig throughout the day. When I vape it on foil (with tolerance), I'll vape anywhere from 5-15 mg at a time, still not exceeding 20 mg in a day. I am sensitive to substances, so take that as you will. I'm also not constantly chasing a high - I'm more trying to stay functional and feel good.\n\n**Vaping:** I prefer this stuff in ecig, because it's easy to control the dose and to redose, and it's pleasant and doesn't smell bad. Information about my method can be found in the post linked up top.\n\nUnfortunately, with the COVID-19 situation, it's hard to find pods for my vape of choice, the Uwell Caliburn. When I vape a-PCYP now, it's on foil. On that note, I've never felt the need to attempt to freebase it.\n\nSo, for vaping it on foil: Powder seems to vape better than small crystals. It has that distinct semen flavor I've read about with pyros (yummy /s). It melts into a yellow-ish oil, and you can see the vapor being produced. It's not harsh at all, and I exhale little to no vapor. Effects come on quickly. I've found it very easy to vape without burning.\n\n**Tolerance:** Of course, when using more days than not, you build tolerance to the positive effects. The euphoria diminishes fastest, but it still feels \"good\" overall and motivation and focus are still there but lessened. The peripheral effects - anxiety, faster heart rate, vasoconstriction - seem to remain with tolerance, which makes it harder to find a good dose and to still get good effects out of it.\n\nI'm taking a break from it for a little while for other stims, because the negatives are starting to outweigh the positives, and I'd prefer to go back to using it in an ecig.\n\n**All in All:** For the fans of a-PVP and a-PHP, this may not be what you're looking for. It doesn't seem to be as recreational as they are, from what I've read. Overall though, I really like a-PCYP, its effects, and the way it vapes. I've managed to go this long using it, and it definitely hasn't consumed my life.\n\n*Final Notes:* I know daily stimulant use isn't healthy by any means, and I know vaping using foil may cause additional negatives. You should care about your health more than I care about mine. Use at your own risk, considering cathinones and pyros can be highly addictive.", "author": "pheniratom", "score": 21, "flair": null, "created": 1585103540.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/foabx4/apcyp_\u03b1pcyp_retrospective_35_days_of_experimenting/", "num_comments": 11, "title": "a-PCYP (\u03b1-PCYP) Retrospective - 35 Days of Experimenting", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fle8r2c": {"score": 4, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/foabx4/apcyp_\u03b1pcyp_retrospective_35_days_of_experimenting/fle8r2c/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1585108505.0, "body": "Thanks for the write up man", "replies": {}}, "flebsk3": {"score": 4, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/foabx4/apcyp_\u03b1pcyp_retrospective_35_days_of_experimenting/flebsk3/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1585110145.0, "body": "did it seem to mess with your throat or lungs at all?", "replies": {"flec3jz": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/foabx4/apcyp_\u03b1pcyp_retrospective_35_days_of_experimenting/flec3jz/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1585110315.0, "body": "Nope, at least not that I've noticed.", "replies": {"fledbyf": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/foabx4/apcyp_\u03b1pcyp_retrospective_35_days_of_experimenting/fledbyf/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1585110997.0, "body": "that's good.

I personally prefer nasal ROA, and 10-20mg insufflated 1x daily can be done with little to no side-effects (for me personally) - then again, I do consume a lot of health supplements, not really supplements, more like food's that are pretty much what supplements mimic and try to copy and synthesize in labs and shit (I will share this supplements below for anybody interested - as they make a tremendous difference for the person wanting to occasionally or even routinely use RCs or any type of drug really, but def. with stimulants!) - anyways, this substance is pretty legit , and I have had plenty of experience binging with this and playing video-games! it's pretty wild, and really great for that type of thing - just keep your dose's between 10-50mg at the most daily and only for like a few days at a time (unless you have a death-wish don't do this everyday at a 50mg+ dose-limit because who knows what kind of long-term side-effects you could get from that) - I am just saying I have done it with 1g amounts and other time's with a 2g amount (again I was binging video games!).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo other than that, I mean, that's my user-experience with this substance, I mean, I am not dead and I have no health issues due to using this compound (that I know of LOL thank god and fingers crossed) I mainly wanted to post this, like I may have mentioned above to share user-experience and to encourage others to comment here and share experience so when someone is looking into this type of thing online for personal use (people will do what people do) - they can find other's experience with it and what not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have been really dabbling with this other RC 3meopcp (just this week) and have to put it away because it is absolutely nothing like 4fmph in the sense of using on a daily basis, no way no how! \n\nSo yeah, there you have it, my take on 4F-mph and my use and experience, feel free to share or comment if you want and remember to be safe with this stuff - I mean, it's here regardless and people are just going to seek and use it until it get's stopped! It's great to have a place to share this kind of info I think anyway, for that reason.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe safe and enjoy!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThose \"food\" supplements I mentioned above...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIrish Sea-Moss (has 92 of the 102 minerals our bodies are composed and made up of); I use powder, and typically parachute with oblate disc's (found on amazon/food-grade and make's parachuting powders E-Z-P-Z); This one is an absolute game-changer, even non-drug-use person's should be taking this stuff like everyday, it's nature's multi-mineral supplement! - that and it beat's everything else out there for health, trust me on this one.\n\nI also consume thing's like Vitamineral Green, Vitamineral Earth, Moringa Leaf Powder, some Chinese Tonic Herb's like He Shou Wu, Goji Berries, Shilajit (resin!), L-Tyrosine, a B-Complex most the time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are other things I take, but that's for another reddit page/forum and another time tbh with you...I'm just listing a few things, more so the Irish Sea Moss (it's a seaweed) because of the minerals - and stimulants really tax the body on that type of thing - so yeah..).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\\\/    (last little bit)   \\\\/\n\n\\>> p.s. don't tell anyone, but I am pretty dissociated at the time of writing this, and this last little bit is completely random! <<\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEn-joy!\n\n\\- B", "author": "InfoJunkie88", "score": 9, "flair": null, "created": 1601732130.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/j4agm9/4fmph_dos_and_donts_you_tell_me/", "num_comments": 11, "title": "4F-MPH Do's and Dont's?
