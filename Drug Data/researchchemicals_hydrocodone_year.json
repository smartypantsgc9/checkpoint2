{"fcone5": {"text": "To preface this, I should mention that I really love stimulants, amphetamines in particular. I have a naturally high tolerance to them, and can handle rather unhealthy amounts of them. For reference a single 30mg adderall taken intranasally doesn't feel that strong to me, and will mostly have the effect of making me crave more. For me the lines blur between \"functional\" and \"recreational\" when it comes to amphetamines, which is why I love them so. I enjoy the fact that I can be very high and experiencing significant euphoria, while also still being able to socialize, complete tasks, and pass as sober to society at large. I fell in love with prescription amphetamine pretty much instantly, so the prospect of an RC that is far cheaper, easily available, and just as good (or even almost as good) was very appealing. As a result I have taken many of them. I will be comparing them to amphetamine mostly, so you can consider that the \"control\" to for all these RCs. I take something for the comedown anytime I take a stimulant. I often also take these long before I come down to smooth it out. My go to is phenibut, but I also use and have used kratom, hydrocodone, 1,4-BDO, CBD, and some RC benzos for this purpose. I have pretty rough comedowns because I tend to take a lot, and I also redose to stay high for a whole day when I take stims. I also wait at least a week between my \"speed days\" and at most I allow myself to take them two days in a row, never more. So I typically am going into the experience with either no tolerance or a rather low tolerance. My habits of usage certainly play a role in how the drugs affect me, so keep that in mind. I will rank each one at the end of its review.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2-FA:** This one is by far the closest RC to Amphetamine in my experience. A 30mg oral dose of 2-FA nearly the same as a 30mg Adderall IR to me, as far as mood lift, stimulation, and side effects. The duration is pretty similar as well. I think Amphetamine is capable of inducing somewhat more euphoria at higher doses, but the difference is rather small. 2-FA still has good euphoria if the proper dose is taken, but its ability as a consistent mood booster is as good as standard amphetamine. In my seasoned opinion, this is the gold standard of functional RC stims, and it is good enough to totally replace expensive RX stims. I think that 2-FA may have a slightly milder comedown compared against the control, but like most of it's qualities it's far more similar than it is different. Great mood boost and stimulation without being too distracting. It is everything that I thought 2-FMA would be, which is an Adderall clone. It is pretty terrible to snort, and it doesn't vape. This one is best oral, but also works very well plugged. I don't have a ton to say about this one, because it's very similar to amphetamine in every regard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2-FMA:** This one was a huge disappointment for me. I was really just hoping it would be even half as good as RX amphetamines, but it just wasn't. People were right when they said it is very functional and has low abuse potential, but that's only because it lacks any significant mood boost/euphoria. Everything was there, the strong stimulation, the focus, muscle tension, the long duration, everything except the enjoyment. It feels like amphetamine with all the pleasure stripped away. It didn't necessarily make me feel bad, but I didn't feel good either. It basically made me feel apathetic and robotic. Even if I was very awake and could focus, I didn't really give a shit about anything. For me amphetamine is useful not just because it helps me focus, but because it gives me a fantastic mood that makes tasks so much more interesting and engaging. Therefore, making me productive. For this reason, 2-FMA was pretty much useless for me. Feeling like a robot who is only compelled to do things by joyless stimulation kind of sucks.\n\nThe only application I could imagine for this drug would be in combinations with other drugs that are enjoyable on their own, but would benefit from a bit of stimulation. At least the potency and duration were rather high. This is by far my least favorite RC amphetamine, it actually really confuses me that people recommend this drug so much, but perhaps I'm to fixated on pleasure to appreciate this as the tool that it is to some people. An amphetamine without pleasure is like an opiod that dulls pain but doesn't have euphoria, what's the point?  At one point, I put some in a bowl of weed, and I think it worked partially. I refuse to get this one again to give a proper vape trial as I would have to pay for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3-FMA:** This one is weird. It honestly does feel somewhat like a midway point between 2-FMA and 4-FMA. The first thing that I noticed about it was how potent it is. I vaporized 30 milligrams, and it felt like I was just coming up on 60mgs of adderall. I found it to be significantly more potent and longer lasting than amphetamine, especially when taken orally. It is also unique in the fact that it vapes nicely. It is pretty euphoric as well, in the ballpark of adderall, maybe a little more intense. When I get really high on speed I get to a point where it's difficult to not rapidly form ideas, either by talking to people, writing, or just basically forming a complex dialogue in my own head. I get to that state VERY QUICKLY with this stuff. It's weird because it can serve the role of a functional drug well enough, but it's definitely not ideal for it. It just skips the stage of being pleasantly stimulated and focused, and goes straight to what is basically a state of controlled mania.\n\nI'm not sure if it does have any effect on serotonin, but if it does it certainly releases far less then 4-FMA. It also seems to be a little on the edgier side, it caused jitteryness and a feeling of over stimulation more than its peers. In general, I think the amphetamines with a methyl group tend to be a little more potent, but are also a little heavier in the undesirable side effects. I found myself needing a little kratom or phenibut to smooth this one out. This one isn't my favorite, but its impressive potency and duration give you a lot of bang for your buck. The fact that you can vape it is also very nice. The powder was mostly small rocks, and it smelled really chemically in an unpleasant way, so I assumed it would be nasty. However, upon vaping it off foil I realized that it had a very mild taste, kind of like a fake sweetener, and didn't burn my lungs at all. It vaporizes even a little bit better than 3-FPM, at least for the batch I got. This one is worth giving a try for amphetamine lovers who enjoy being perhaps a little too blasted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4-FMA:** This one is really rather euphoric. It definitely releases some serotonin, but not enough to make it a proper empathogen. It also releases to much to really be a functional stimulant either. This one is kind of just in a stimulant limbo. On one occasion, I did take it at work in a succession of smaller doses. It got me through my shift with no sleep, but it took a toll on me. It's very good for socializing, especially informally with friends, but it's a little too rolly to be good for focusing or studying. It's also not even as complete of a roll as say 3-MMC. I found that it was a little less potent than amphetamine, and also had a worse comedown. In general, it seems to be a bit harsher on the body and mind, probably in part due to serotonin release. It's not really a terrible drug, it's just right in-between two roles, neither of which it can satisfactorily fulfill. This one would probably be best for recreational activities where you want plenty of euphoria and stimulation without dedicating to an actual roll. It's not the worse stimulant I've tried for sure, but if you've got other options go with those.  It seems like this is just a shittier version of 4-FA, a drug that was able to fit into two roles far better. The second worse one I've tried.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3-FEA:** This is the only one in this list that I would consider to be a true empathogen. This is possibly the most unique amphetamine that I have tried, because it is by far the least stimulating. When you take an empathogen like MDMA, there is some level of relaxation mixed with the stimulation due to the serotonin release. It's pretty subtle with a drug like MDMA, but its like 3-FEA takes that kind of serotoninergic chill, and presents it in its pure form, without the in your face stimulation. It almost seems as if it's amphetamine, but with most of the dopamine and norepinephrine replaced by serotonin. It's the only amphetamine I have taken that didn't compel me to constantly move. The dosages for this one were very high, but even at very high doses there wasn't a whole lot of muscle tension or stimulation. At a certain dose level (I don't remember what it was, but it was high) it did become a true roll in my opinion, just the most relaxing roll ever. It actually was a little trippy at that point. Unlike 4-FMA, where even when you took a lot you never felt like you were even close to rolling. The weird part was that at doses below the threshold of rolling, it was literally just a relaxing amphetamine. It felt like speed, just instead of that pushy energetic rush, there was a calm sense of well being and chill. I felt more social, but instead of it being driven by stimulation it was driven by a feeling of openness and calm.\n\nDue to its rolly nature, this one is probably not good to take as frequently as standard amphetamines, but it is really nice and worth trying. Some people characterized this drug as being a useless in-between like 4-FMA, but it's far more interesting and fun than that. I personally found the comedown to be a lot more tolerable than drugs like 6-APB or MDMA. It was about as bad as an amphetamine comedown, just different. Instead of acute mental and physical discomfort, it took the form of a gradual transition out of the high and into a feeling similar to how you feel about a day after a strong MDMA roll, emotionally drained. This drug is super unique, if you like entactogens this one is worth trying, if nothing else but for the novelty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3-FPM:** I know this isn't technically an amphetamine, but it's pretty similar and it's got a flourine on it. Plus I want to talk about this one. This is one of two stimulants I have vaped. Because of this, it is elevated to a higher status for me. Especially since this drug is fucking painful to sniff, even more so than most of the previously mentioned drugs; all of which, besides pharma amphetamine, are pretty awful to snort. I think what I like the most about 3-FPM is that is has less unpleasant side effects than any other drug on this list overall. I can sleep more quickly, eat more easily, clench my jaw less, and have considerably more tolerable comedowns. One might assume that this is a trade off for euphoria, but I disagree (sort of). For me, 3-FPM can have euphoria as good as amphetamine, it just doesn't last as long. It has a short window of real pleasure, and then the majority of the rest of the high is just okay. Oral amphetamine has 3 to 4 hours of the actually really good peak effects, where 3-FPM has one, even though I feel like the total duration of 3-FPM is roughly the same. As a result of this, it lends itself to continual dosing, which is why vaporization is my favorite ROA for this one. It's really easy to just vape a bit of it every half hour or so and just keep a nice high going. It's strange though. You want to redose to get back the euphoria, but you don't actually start coming down until a few hours after you start craving. So it can be insanely fiendish, but if you're occupied you can kind of just ignore it for a little bit, as opposed to something like coke.\n\nIt's also far less potent that amphetamine, probably about half as strong. The lower potency combined with the extremely forgiving nature of this stim means that even when you're using a ridiculous amount of the stuff during a binge it never fucks with you as much as you feel like it should. For these reasons, it's a pretty good functional drug (as long as you're using ROA's other than vaped), second to 2-FA as far as RCs go for me, but it's also a pretty decent recreational drug. It's super fun to vape a ton of it with some friends because you can enjoy that satisfaction of overindulgence without paying the price that less friendly stims will charge (shit like hexen for example). I have a feeling that 3-FPM has far less of an effect on adrenaline than most amphetamines, while still releasing a good amount of dopamine. The high is really smooth and clean and doesn't have much edginess to it. It's not like a serotonergic kind of smoothness either, it's like a purified dopamine high. This one is one of my favorite stims, simply because it's so light, yet it still has that nice energetic euphoria. I blow through this drug so quickly when I have it though. It's ironic that the lightest stim on this list is also the most compulsive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis list has all of the ones I've tried so far. I know this list is missing 3-FA, 4-FA, and 4-FEA. I would love to try the first two, although it wouldn't surprise me if 4-FA is pretty much extinct to Americans. From what I hear, 4-FEA is an even less potent version of 3-FEA, which sounds pretty useless, so I doubt I'll try it. I hope someone can get something of value from this 3-FMA fueled monstrosity, my apologies for this wall o' text.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited for grammar and sanity.", "author": "colorfulexistance", "score": 257, "flair": null, "created": 1583235805.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/fcone5/my_reviews_on_all_of_the_flourinated_amphetamines/", "num_comments": 111, "title": "My Reviews On All of The Flourinated Amphetamines I've Tried", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fjc3rrp": {"score": 47, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/fcone5/my_reviews_on_all_of_the_flourinated_amphetamines/fjc3rrp/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1583236662.0, "body": "Good read.

Note that I have been prescribed Seconal (one of the most addictive drugs) in the past and stopped it without a second thought. I also have no addictions and I am 49 years old.\n\nUsed to think I had chronic kidney stones so I went to the ER frequently. Often there was a stone but sometimes there wasn\u2019t. I had always assumed I simply passed it.\n\nIn 2014 I had severe pain and visited a urologist who did a CAT or MRI and found no stones and send me to a spine pain specialist. As it turns out I had broken my back when I was much younger - maybe 14-15 years old (see image). Of course, I didn\u2019t know that at the time but I did have a significant fall.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/tAcn69B.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/tAcn69B.jpg)\n\nI was treated with cortisone shots in my spine and the pain vanished within a day or two. That lasted about four years which I\u2019m told is considered a great outcome.\n\nOver the last couple of years this pain has been increasing. I had more cortisone shots about a year ago. Those helped for about two weeks and since that time it has only grown worse.\n\nAt this point I have to stay in bed for 2-3 days in order to be more mobile for a day without massive pain. As a result I have gained a lot of weight (up to 400 lbs), so exercise has become more difficult. Walking almost any distance is painful. Sitting upright for long periods of time is painful. I am doing intermittent fasting combined with Keto to help weight loss but there is only so much that can do with such inactivity.\n\nThe spine pain specialist told me that medications will not help with the exception of these cortisone pills which I can only take twice a year. I believe he may be right as at one time I did try taking Hydrocodone and there was absolutely no discernible difference in the pain.\n\nSO MY QUESTION is:\n\nDoes anyone know of anything that may be much stronger that could help me be more mobile to the point where I can lose enough weight in order to qualify for spinal surgery? I know nothing about OxiContin or Fentanyl. I\u2019m considering seeking help from a pain control doctor of some kind, but if there is likely nothing that can treat my pain to some degree I won\u2019t bother.\n\nI really need some guidance here. I\u2019m concerned that I may end up with a pain specialist who is more of a pill mill. I need help, not a high. In fact, I think the only time I have ever experience anything like that was at the ER with huge doses of morphine and I\u2019m not interested in a feeling other than NOT HURTING when I need to be more active.\n\nAny advice or thoughts are appreciated. I don\u2019t think I will live long the way things are going, and I am married with four kids (sole large-income provider who works at home).\n\nTHANK YOU!", "author": "bdunn", "score": 8, "flair": null, "created": 1581833805.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/f4gqse/severe_back_pain_help/", "num_comments": 81, "title": "Severe back pain.

I'm a few years younger than you but my body is probably twice as old as yours. I was an Offensive Lineman through college (UMICH'93-'97). I'm 6'8.3\" and 267-270lbs now but target playing weight was 340lbs and I made it up to 390lbs a few times during the off-season (I was also 6'9\" on the nose 20 years ago).\n\nMy body is a fucking mess, my knees not too bad but my back is cursed. Team doctors used to hand out 180ct scripts of Vicodin and Percocet, which I continued well after school. Starting in my 30's after 14 surgeries and dozens of steroid injections in the spine and nerve ablation procesudres (which burning of the nerve roots worked the best), my pain management doctors (also at University of Michigan) moved me over to the Fentanyl pain patch (100mcgr/hr on day 1 of 3 and another 50mcgr/hr patch on day 2-3) plus 10-20mg Opana (oxymorphone) 2-3 times a day for breakthrough. Fentanyl didn't work very well for nerve pain and being a purely synthetic opiate, made me super grumpy all the time. Natural opiates like Vicodin and Opana. give me a warm feeling and lift my mood.. and while taking opiates the mood natural opiates put me in did more good in helping me ignore the pain than it did blocking it.\n\nI couldn't stand taking opiates any longer though, I got pulled over once and had pain patch wrappers in my car (I would put one on out in my car before work and just toss the wrappers in the pocket of the door, but I didn't have the box they came in and got arrested in front of my children. So I told my doctors I was taking myself off everything and was just going to live with the pain. My pain management doctors said \"please, don't do that\" and wanted me to try Suboxone (the opiate abuse treatment drug) for the back pain and it worked better than anything else I had tried and I would recommend that to most people, but for me it was still not enough to justify all the hassle of monthly DR visits, monthly blood work, and monthly blood drugs tests, etc. I took that for a year before hearing about Kratom. I took myself off the Suboxone, tried Medical Marijuana for a few months which didn't do anything for the pain and then finally gave Kratom an honest effort. That was 4-6 years ago and I haven't stopped taking Kratom since. It works amazingly well. My dosage is the same as when I started and I get around as well as my 75 year-old father now, where he used to get around waaaay better than me.\n\nAnyways, I feel or have felt exactly where you're at. Have kids that need their pops but am not looking forward to the pain getting any worse. Before I found what worked and made the pain tolerable for me (Kratom), I thought about suicide, hoping my kids would understand that the pain was so intense that I spent 70% of my waking hours unable to think and only be able to say \"omfg, omfg, omfg, please stop hurting, omfg\".\n\nMy best recommendation: throw the book at it. Go to a pain clinic. They treat not only the symptoms of pain but also the psychological aspects of it too.

Being arrested in front of your children for your pain medication. Unreal.\n\nI have a few questions and I may DM you on some of this:\n\nHow do you go about finding a good pain medicine doctor for this kind of pain? I think we have the same kind of pain which is being caused by pinching nerves in the spine. It hurts worse than anything I can imagine (and I've had plenty of kidney stones). I am in the process of looking for real help now. Since my spine pain specialist told me no pain meds would help me, and after trying Hydrocodone and having ZERO relief like I took nothing at all, I kind of gave up. After watching The Pharmacist on Netflix, I rather ironically started to think about getting help as my life is not improving. I feel it is getting worse and fast. This is the first time in my life I had to come face to face with the fact that I am actually... mortal. Why are men/boys so damn stupid?\n\nBased on a lot of recommendations, I tried Kratom this morning and then I had a very active day (for me compared to how it's been recently). Right now I am in incredibly pain, but throughout the day I didn't feel the pain anything like I had every day until today. They were sold in pill form, and there is no dosage per pill indicated. They also sell it in powder form. Since this may have worked for me, at least for today, could you tell me more about how you take that and manage it? I am absolutely clueless about Kratom other than my experience with it today that I am literally praying was not a fluke. I spent hours with my son working on installing a CarPlay stereo in his car. I cannot tell you how wonderful something that simple was to me considering how it has been for many months.\n\nAnything you can share on what you are doing and what did and did not work for you would be appreciated.

I kept getting my mind blown every time I took the no2, kept saying I figured everything out and it turned into a joke in the end because after every hit I took, I would remember that I was going to forget everything and then I realised I kept forgetting everything because the information I was receiving was meant to be kept a secret as I was unable to speak out loud the ideas I was getting. Eventually I managed to pull some information out, writing down things as well but I don't know if I remembered this 'secret'. I figured out that I was merely a thought travelling through still frames of reality and that time was created by travelling through these still frames one by one like a digital video. It looks like a lag effect. Every frame of reality exists at once in the Universe; past, present and future. The Universe is like a finshed film and time is the illusion of movement created by travelling through these still frames of the film one by one, from start to finish. I also figured out that our conscious is nothing but a chain of thoughts and memories, a chain of moments of reality. Every thought connects with a unique reality or dimension. Our thoughts mirrors our environment and we are moulded by the thoughts and moments we remember. We can change who we are by changing our thoughts and memories. I had contradictory thoughts all the time too. I remember being a thought and the environment at the same time, kinda like the quantum cat theory, I felt like I was alive and dead at the same time as well. I eventually realised that everything in the Universe exists on a spectrum and that the world isn't black or white. We are a mix of two opposites which means I could be 90% alive and 10% dead and that makes me healthy and energetic or I could be 60% alive and 40% dead which makes me sick and have no energy. Gender is mixed too and defined by masculine and feminine energies. I could be 80% masculine and 20% feminine which makes me a man or I could be 45% masculine and 55% feminine which makes me a tomboy. 90% feminine and 10% masculine would likely make me a girly girl. We are all a mix of light and dark energy, good and bad, yin and yang. The spectrum theory really helps me understand why the world works the way it does. One other thing I remember as well is that I felt like I had no control over the thoughts I was having, it felt like my mind was mirroring the environment and it was the environment that was in control of my thoughts. For example, if I wanted to take another hit of the No2, it was the energy of the No2 itself that gave me the thoughts to huff it. If I wanted to eat a burger for dinner, it was the collective energy of the burger that gave me the thoughts to want to eat one. It's like all matter has a purpose and we get thoughts based on the environments energy and purpose. This has led me to start to believing that everything in the Universe is consciousness and I'm now experimenting with the idea that the conscious environment controls the everyday thoughts that you have. MDMA and No2 together is truly a powerful experience and I've always had mind blowing trips every time. Who knows what I'll find out next, what do you think of the information I got out of this mix?\nI've never had experiences this mind blowing before.", "replies": {"fiyec40": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/f9f7hs/my_research_chemical_and_drug_review_compilation/fiyec40/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1582866568.0, "body": "Consciousness is energy and the universe is an ocean of energy.

Personally I've only experienced the former and not the latter, but I still understand the risk involved and choose to tread carefully with serotonergic RCs.\n\n---\n\nHere's my anecdotal experience with my prescription combo and perceived interactions.\n\nDaily: \n\n- Escitalopram (SSRI): General Anxiety \n- Mirtazapine (Tetracyclic antidepressant): Depression, Anxiety, Insomnia, Appetite, Allergies\n\nGenerally what I've noticed is that RCs in the realm of entactogens have very little if any effects. From what I've tried these include 4-FA and 3-MMC. 4-FA has a subtle mood lift at 100mg but is generally underwhelming. 3-MMC was even less noticeable around 125mg, half insufflated half oral. Interesting since most consider this irresistibly fiendish. 4-FEA (comparatively benign) at moderate doses was much more noticeable in terms of mood lifting but made me drowsy. Because of these results I haven't bothered with the other 'entactogenic' chems I have like 4-FMA, 3-FMA, Eutylone, 6-APB.\n\nLooking at more recreational dopaminergic stims things become more noticeable but still not in line with a lot of anecdotal reports. a-PCYP is enjoyable but even binges of vaping 60mg+ I still feel mostly sober, nothing approaching 'instant psychosis' like some experience. Hexen in comparison is downright boring, I really don't understand the appeal of this. Small hint of a dopamine release with acute tachycardia. 3-FPM at any dose, oral, vaped, may as well be a placebo.\n\nI haven't touched psychedelics since they'll surely be diminished and I'd like to have a 'clean slate' before tripping.\n\nCompared to suffering with chronic anxiety pre-meds, benzos feel almost pointless. They have lost nearly all recreational value for me. Previously though, highly enjoyable. \n\n\n**Stuff that works as expected:** \n\nDCK (Just good fun every couple months)\n\nO-DSMT (Pleasant but can strangely make me quite irritable and increase BP to the point my ears are ringing. Seldom used, prefer hydrocodone slightly)\n\nMost 'classical' stimulants (substituted amphetamines, methylphenidate analogues), including 2-FA, 2-FMA, IPPH, 4F-MPH. Euphoria from 2-FA and 2-FMA is significant enough to be distracting and seems to make me suddenly drowsy after a couple hours. Methylphenidate types are preferable for functional purposes. These also override the appetite stimulating effects of Mirtazapine.\n\n---\n**Layman Interpretations:**\n\nI'm fairly certain Mirtazapine is having the largest impact, likely diminishing most effects in particular my capacity to get much out of recreational stimulants, I believe explained by its antiserotonergic, antihistamine, and \u03b12-blocker effects. Mirtazapine has been researched for use in the treatment of drug addiction and dependence so as a layman I'd like to assume it has some responsibility for my general disinterest in recreational stimulants. After many months of long term 4f-mph and 2-fma (~5 days a week) use I don't experience much in terms of withdrawal on days off. \n\nEscitalopram's interactions are less clear to me besides affecting serotonin, but as a CYP2D6 inhibitor it might reduce some effects. Also it obliterated my sex drive and stims of any kind have no noticeable effect on that (sadly), O-DSMT and DCK are the only substances that seem to relieve that, but they're subtle. \n\n---\n\nWould be interested in how others have experienced interactions with prescription meds, or any links to studies/literature/anecdotes about these sorts of interactions.", "author": "theholydrug", "score": 26, "flair": null, "created": 1595916753.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/hz2480/lets_talk_about_interactions_with_antidepressants/", "num_comments": 25, "title": "Let's talk about interactions with antidepressants and other prescription drugs", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fzge0h9": {"score": 15, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/hz2480/lets_talk_about_interactions_with_antidepressants/fzge0h9/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1595919200.0, "body": "No surprise the entactogens don't work well with SSRIs.

Not sure at this point.\n\n0:15 - Suddenly feel a strong opioid effect coming over me, I'm begging to zone out looking at my screen and a strong sensation of warmth is spreading from head to toe.\n\n0:30 - Wow the rush was incredible, I have gone from completely sober to extremely high within the span of only about 20 minutes, I feel a strong \"stoned\" sensation in my head and have all of the classic opioid effects that one would expect from a strong opiate narcotic like oxycodone or hydrocodone (If not even stronger looking back). However the sedation aspect isn't quite there, I do feel spaced out and heavy-eyed, however I have been unable to catch a nod thus far.\n\n1:00 - After my previous entry I got in bed for the next half hour. Although still feel extremely \"opiate high\" and have now nodded off a few times the Euphoria is begging to fade. \n\n1:30 - Effects are still very strong and subtle itching is begging to set in. Although I feel incredibly sedated and disconnected from my body I haven't been able to nod as much as I normally would off other classic opiates. My body almost feels as if its sinking into my bed, really nice actually.\n\n2:00 - I'm begging to return to baseline. Although I still feel some pretty decent opioid effects I'm definitely past the peak and am actually starting to nod a little harder then before, possibly because the other non-opioid aspects of the drug are wearing off? The euphoria is pretty much gone however yet physically, I still feel amazing. \n\n3:30 - The effects are almost gone now. I still have a lingering opioid sensation through out my body but I am no longer nodding and mentally I feel very tired and still slightly spacey but almost baseline other then that.\n\n5:00 Effects are totally gone, although I barely still feel a slight comfort through out my body, mentally I am completely sober and ready to go to sleep.\n\nConclusion: \n\nWow for a legal RC this is amazing. Its by far the best legal opioid I have ever tried and kicks kratom's ass if you want a classic full agonist high. Its definitely not as \"clean\" feeling as morphine/fentanyl derived opiates but its damn close. For me It felt like a mix between tramadol and oxycodone, leaning far more towards oxy if not being even stronger in some aspects. Although the peak and overall duration is short It has an incredible rush and feels no different then a strong narcotic I would expect to be given by a doctor. \n\nHowever despite my praise this drug is not all good, as I'm sure many of you know it has awful withdrawals and due to its short duration is incredibly fiendish. This is mostly because although the bodily opiate effects linger about as long as oxycodone the euphoria fades rapidly within less then 2 hours and possibly shorter as tolerance builds. \n\nIn conclusion tianeptine sodium provides a slightly dirtier and shorter but arguably stronger oxycodone like high. It feels no different from a classic opioid and I believe the potential for abuse is no less. If you can see yourself having problems with opiate use or have been dependent in the past stay far away from this drug because although the high is good it will smash all classic opioids in terms of withdrawal and tolerance.

Since it's a tricyclic anti depressant it works on multiple systems, only one of which is the mu opioid receptors. Normal prescribed doses are 12.5 mg 3x daily, so recreational doses are roughly 10 times a singular dose. The issue with that is that a lot of the other mechanisms (serotonin reuptake enhancement, glutamatergic system downregulation) do not scale in the same way as the opioid effects.\n\nThis means that to get the desired opioid effects, people have to take massive doses that end up raising tolerance/activating other pathways really quickly and aggressively. This means that while normal withdrawal from opiates can be uncomfortable, withdrawal from tianeptine is like withdrawing from an opiate, an antidepressant, and a benzodiazepine/tranquilizer all at the same time, and after a shorter period of use than a typical opioid. It would be especially strong because of the doses being 10x+ the therapeutic effect as well, meaning someone unlucky enough to kick a tianeptine habit will be in for:\n\nrunny nose, achy bones, no energy, hot/cold flashes, stomach cramps/explosive diarrhea, increased pain sensitivity, extreme restless leg syndrome, extreme feelings of sadness/depression/hopelessness, akathisia, extreme anxiety.\n\nPeople should be able to choose what they do/put in their bodies, as long as it doesn't harm others.

I won\u2019t lie, I was a little scared of this chemical based on what I had heard in reviews (causticity, nausea), but I decided to give it a go anyways. \n\nI have done a few opioids before, all in the last couple of months or so. These experiences were with 15mg of Hydrocodone on three different occasions all taken orally, .3mg of Buprenorphine plugged (not combined with nalaxone), and, on maybe 3 or 4 different occasions, a combo of 250-500mg Phenibut FAA insuffuted and 3-4 grams of Kratom taken orally. My tolerance for trying all of these chemicals, including trying 2map, has been very low or nonexistent. \n\nI had heard 2map has a similar potency to morphine, and because 15mg of Hydrocodone was great for me and had a similar potency, I decided to try 16mg of 2map. I mixed 80mg of 2map into 5ml of distilled water, then drew it up into 5, 1cc oral syringes. \n\nWhen the time came for my first dose, I poured out a small glass of distilled water after eating a medium sized meal to reduce nausea. Into the glass of distilled water, 1cc (16mg 2map) of solution was added. I drank the glass of water, and it had a distinct taste, similar to the smell, which was like a mix of cheese and gasoline, the taste only lingered for a few seconds, and wasn\u2019t particularly unpleasant. Much better than the taste of Kratom.\n\nWithin 10 minutes of ingestion, I felt the usual opiate warmth, and significant euphoria and sedation. For an equal dose of Hydrocodone, I would say 2map has twice the amount of sedation, with maybe 5-7x more euphoria. It was also slightly itchy. The effects continued to climb in intensity for another 30 minutes, and then began to decline until I was at baseline just over 2 hours after dosing. My first experience with 2map was much stronger and euphoric than I expected by a very large amount. I would imagine that\u2019s what heroin would feel like, and hearing other people compare it to medium quality H definitely makes sense.\n\nMy second dose of 2map occurred two nights later, and this time 1 drank 1.5cc (24mg 2map) of solution, and then redosed with 1cc (16mg 2map) of solution an hour and a half later. The effects were very similar to the first time, only more intense, and more nod-friendly. Redosing was very nice and smooth, and the very fast come up time makes for an amazing experience. Music was enjoyable as well which is nice because on some opioids it becomes annoying. I\u2019ve heard some people say it is stimulating, but I didn\u2019t experience any stimulation at all really. Buprenorphine was much more stimulating.\n\nOverall, this chemical is wayyy better than any other opioid high I\u2019ve ever experienced, and I can see why people have compared it to heroin. I experienced no discomfort or nausea taking it orally as long as I ate with it or drank a glass of milk with it. It completely blows Hydrocodone, Buprenorphine, and Kratom+Phenibut out of the water for me, so if you don\u2019t have much of a tolerance, this is an amazing, cheap opioid to buy.", "author": "SibeliusVC", "score": 14, "flair": null, "created": 1592548990.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/hboqm4/2methylap237_was_miles_ahead_of_any_other_opioid/", "num_comments": 12, "title": "2-Methyl-AP-237 was miles ahead of any other opioid I\u2019ve tried (Report)", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fva9yvl": {"score": 24, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/hboqm4/2methylap237_was_miles_ahead_of_any_other_opioid/fva9yvl/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1592552763.0, "body": "Best opioid you tried and the hardest one you\u2019ve done is subs?

However, I recently got some diclazepam blotters for this purpose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy previous go-to comdown drugs were phenibut and 1,4-BDO, either separate, or together in reduced amounts. I realized that they were both euphoric enough to entice me to stay up later. Often I would dose them before the my \"\"last \"\" dose of speed wore off, only to continue dosing speed because the GABA euphoria made me lose my inhibitions and not give a fuck. So even though 1,4-BDO was great at making me sleep, it also makes me want to party until 5am.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am hoping diclazepam will make me sleepy without being too enjoyable, if you get what I mean.

If I take some of the benzo while I am still speeding, will it kill the amphetamine high, or will the highs combine, like phenibut with amphet? Will I get rebound anxiety or a hangover from a reasonable dose of diclazepam?\n\nI have never properly tried benzos before, so general advice is appreciated *(except this one time I took just .25 milligrams of klonopin while I was high on 2-FDCK, weed, 4-aco-DMT, nitrous, and maybe some phenibut? while coming off of a lot of 3-FEA, so yeah I couldn't really tell what it did).*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe last GABAergic I used was a single gram of phenibut 5 days ago, so I'm guessing that puts me at zero tolerance.

I\u2019ve never really had any interest in any types of opiates before hand as I found them very lackluster and not worth it for the rep they have. However as I grow older it\u2019s nice to have a chemical that doesn\u2019t change your mind state as psychedelics or weed can do. \n\n*ODSMT* was very warm and cozy with a little amount of itch compared to 2MAP237. It lasted about 3-5 hours longer. And I noticed it was less nauseating which I enjoyed because the nausea you get from opiates is pretty unpleasant. \nDoses 20mg-40mg were my go to for the first couple of uses. But after 2-3 doses in between a  week I noticed I needed to increase my dosage to 40-60mg to feel the same effect. \nI went up to 80-90mg and the nausea was pretty unpleasant unless I laid down in my bed which it would quickly subside and I would feel amazing laying under my covers. If I decided to walk around or even play video games the nausea would come back. I noticed the itch kind of felt better than 2MAP.\n\n*2-METHYL-AP237* is more potent than ODSMT. I started with 10mg which felt really nice and enjoyed it more than a dose of ODSMT. However as my doses increased I noticed the side effects were kind of annoying. You really need to eat something and top it off with ice cream or milk so you don\u2019t get any stomach discomfort. I would not enjoy the nausea I felt it more in my gut with this one. I went up to 30-60mg on this one and the itchy ness was more annoying than ODSMT\u2019s. This high however reminded me of trying hydrocodone for my first time. \n\nOverall these are good chemicals if you like opiates then I\u2019m sure you will enjoy these.

I also notice a definite change in headspace. It feels like I\u2019ve just taken maybe 50mg butalbital or 5-10mg ambien. Very subtle, but noticeable. It almost feels like 100mg dxm. I will update in the next hour, as I just took another 50mg.\n\nT:1:00: took another 50mg capsule. No difference really noticeable from the last dose.\n\nT:1:30: another 50mg, still not much effect.\n\nT:2:00: another 100mg, with little effect. However, Nose does feel irritated and is very runny.\n\nT:3:00: same effects, I take 130mg more. I took 10mg loratadine as well an hour ago, this seems to help some strange mild side effects like the feeling of pressure in face, and nose:\n\nT:3:30: take 50mg more. Starting to notice some muscle relaxation and euphoria. Maybe the adequate dose of what I have is 400mg or so\n\nNext day. I am reflecting on last nights experience, it was very lackluster, and the effects were very weak. I believe the drug wears off quickly and needs about 300mg to cause an effect, and the fact I was taking it so spaced out made it so that by the time the larger doses were taken, I was no longer feeling the previous doses. \n\nTonight, about 40 minutes ago I took 360mg, and am feeling like I just took .5mg clonazepam. (I should note I took an antacid tablet about 10 minute after taking the 360mg, as it felt as if I just took 2 shots of some strong liquor, and my stomach was burning like a cross between alcohol and heartburn. I wonder if the antacid made me absorb more of the clomethiazole, as I felt the effects about 20 minutes later.) I do feel sedation and it is quite nice. It\u2019s like a half and half mix between a barb and a benzo, quite pleasurable, also, my nose is not very irritated tonight and it is feeling just fine. I will take another 100mg in a minute and report back. At the end of writing this I took another 100mg at T:0:50:\n\nT:1:30: another 192mg taken.  Total 652mg\n\nT:2:15: another 150mg taken, total 802mg. I am feeling slightly drunk, like I took .75mg Xanax and maybe smoked a tiny bit of weed. Or took that with 5mg hydrocodone almost.\n\nT:2:45: took another 110mg. Feeling significantly more intoxicated. Balance is fucked. But I am still not super messed up, I could handle maybe another 300mg, but I will tread lightly, and take it slow until tomorrow. Tomorrow I will try dosing 700mg right away, maybe. (I read someone saying doses were like phenibut doses, like 1-2 grams, but I don\u2019t know if that much would be safe yet.)\n\nT:3:15: another 125mg. The effects have seem to plateau at how I felt at 650mg or so. Now it is just being sustained by each dose.\n\nT:340: another 157mg. Effects still plateaued.\n\nT:4:30: another 200mg taken. Effects slightly above how they felt at 650mg. I believe I can handle about twice this. I am not particularly sedated, my breathing is the same. I just feel very calm and my motor skills are disrupted. My perception of time is slightly shrunk. Meaning that 30 minutes feels more like 20 to me. I notice it\u2019s been 4 hours since I first dosed but feels like 3.\n\nRETROSPECTION: Next day, today, January 8th. DAMNNN that stuff is pretty nice. After that last  200mg I was pretty high and I can say that at a total of 1400mg, over 5 hours or so felt very nice and pretty strong. I would guess that it would be much too high of a dose to take that all at once. I feel that one single dose of clomethiazole, lasts about 3 hours or so in terms of duration of action. Now I have only taken two drugs that work at barbiturate sites, butalbital (in fiorcet) and carisoprodol (soma). I took butalbital one time, and soma twice, years ago. I can say that I feel some effects of butalbital in this (the fucked up, sort of blurry vision and movement feeling) but the drug that is closest is SOMA. Soma I find is the most comparable to clomethiazole, and most of its effects were witnessed in clomethiazole.

I\u2019m also feeling a \u201cwarm\u201d feeling in my stomach, this was slightly pleasurable. To help with my nose burning, I drank some peppermint tea.\n\nT-0:40: Nose burning has slightly subsided, and now I\u2019m feeling somewhat relaxed.\n\nT-1:00: Feeling nice and relaxed now, but it isn\u2019t too powerful to the point of feeling disinhibition or sedation. It\u2019s just a relaxing feeling.\n\nT-2:00: Effects have completely gone away, the remnants of the nose burning has completely disappeared. Feeling as though I hadn\u2019t even dosed. No urge to redose.\n\nT-10:00: I fell asleep pretty quickly after typing up my final thoughts, but when I awoke I felt very nauseous. I ran to my washroom and puked. The problem is that, I puked a large amount of blood. This obviously was concerning, so I paid a visit to my doctor and explained that I had taken the HCl salt form of Clomethiazole. He just had a look down my throat and saw that it was completely raw, seemed as though the acid from throwing up had burned my esophagus and caused micro tears from any food coming up. My doctor said it was nothing to be concerned about, although recommended that I stay away from future use of the substance.\n\nConclusion: Overall, my experience with Clomethiazole wasn\u2019t special enough to even make me want to redose. The euphoria and sedation was mild (although I had only taken 200mg), and the half-life seemed to short to be a desirable substance. Since then, I haven\u2019t felt the urge to take another dose and have just stocked with benzos. Benzos offer a more powerful effect without any fear of acidity. I\u2019m aware that my experience with the throwing up blood is unique, but should be noted for anyone with a sensitive stomach like myself. \n\nEnsure that if you wish to consume this drug, that you have proper safety equipment to handle the substance, as it\u2019s incredibly acidic.
