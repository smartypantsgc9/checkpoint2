{"f97jui": {"text": "I got an Uber driver yesterday to go pick up my car from the auto garage. We got to talking and I mentioned that I had been in school in the area, and she asked if I graduated, and I said no, I dropped out after a few years. And then expounded that it was because of a substance abuse issue. \n\nThis woman, who was like a 60 year old white woman that looked like an average sweet grandma, started telling me about how she was addicted to crack in the 70s and fucked around a bit with meth too. She said she was spending about $75 a week (in 1970s money so about $350 today) on it back then. But that she finally got her shit together after she got pregnant. She told me a lot about how even years later certain smells or other things will hit her deep and it\u2019s not something that\u2019s very easily gone away. \n\nI told her about how I spent the last 3 years addicted to meth mainly but also heroin. How whenever I smell vinegar, I still get that craving for dope. About how at my max I was spending $1000 a month on drugs. I told her about how my psychiatrist got me a prescription for suboxone and that\u2019s why I\u2019m off heroin, and that he undoubtedly saved my life in that respect. And I told her that I was 3 and a half months off meth, and she gave me a high five. \n\nThen we got to my destination, and as we\u2019re pulling up, she says \u201cDo you mind if I pray over you real quick?\u201d  Now I\u2019m not a religious person at all, but I said \u201cOf course not\u201d and so she pulled into a parking spot, took my hand, and said a short prayer asking God to watch over me and keep me on my current path and I nearly fucking cried. It was one of the sweetest things a stranger has ever done for me. I very sincerely thanked her and then picked up my car and drove home.\n\nEdit: corrected some spelling", "author": "AntiqueVictory", "score": 8979, "flair": null, "created": 1582650256.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/f97jui/my_uber_driver_asked_if_she_could_pray_for_me/", "num_comments": 280, "title": "My Uber driver asked if she could pray for me before dropping me off", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fipvh16": {"score": 1669, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/f97jui/my_uber_driver_asked_if_she_could_pray_for_me/fipvh16/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1582652308.0, "body": "That was a beautiful read, it\u2019s life moments like that which keep you going.", "replies": {"fiq4udq": {"score": 372, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/f97jui/my_uber_driver_asked_if_she_could_pray_for_me/fiq4udq/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1582663941.0, "body": "Yeah, I agree.

We can\u2019t prove that we are real, we can\u2019t prove that a dog is a dog, we just hold these statements to be facts because they meet the criteria to be so. So until proven otherwise we are real, the earth is round, etc. There is a possibility that we could be all holograms or extremely advanced ai, there is a possibility that the earth is actually flat and there is some weird force that makes us perceive it as round both visually and physically but these probabilities are infinitely small because there are infinite possibilities of what is true and not. This is where science stops and philosophy takes over.\n\nAnyways, since we can\u2019t technically prove anything, there is no such thing as a \u201cfact\u201d by definition. Instead we use the word fact for universally accepted theories.

To all the atheists out there best know I\u2019m not asking some white dude in the sky to give me car give me house give me me give me. And whats awesome is if your idea is some white dude in the sky that\u2019s absolutely okay because the importance of the idea of god is not figuring out exactly what god is or isn\u2019t but the act of having faith in something. I believe god was in the energy OP and ol lady shared in that Uber ride. And when I pray I\u2019m not asking for things, what i\u2019m doing is expressing gratitude for what I have right now, and asking to be patient and have the ability to see that energy in the people around me, otherwise I\u2019m shut off and disconnected from the world and Im stuck in self centeredness and self seeking only thinking of me me me. So I think of god as more of an energy that all living things are innately trying to seek out from life, and every single person has the ability to give to others that positive energy. So if anything when I pray i\u2019m just setting a positive intention for the day ahead of me, a spiritual foundation to build off of. So when that lady was praying for OP that is god to me, they both saw and respected the light in eachother. And you know what is so cool about all of this, i could be wrong, it  coud all be bullshit and there is no god and my words arent effecting anything, nothing is hearing us and there\u2019s no point to life. But its not a matter of if we\u2019rd truly being heard or if its real it\u2019s having faith in the first place. And when you have faith and you put that into action and it improves your life and it helps other people does it really truly matter if it\u2019s real or not?

By the time I was in my mid 20's I had experimented with just about every drug under the sun and I will admit I did think myself to be pretty invincible when it came to dosage and usage. I had pushed my limits so many times before, usually with little to no negative consequences I quit worrying about my choices. There is a really really fine line between being a user and an abuser, and when you don't see all the negative effects right there in your face you tend to not think of yourself as the latter. Long story short I rode out years of heroin abuse and addiction until finally I arrived at the bottom. I didn't think there was any way back up, and attempted to end things by OD. Somehow that didn't work out how I intended and I woke up about 20 hours later. A few weeks go by and christmas time rolled around, I finally told my parents about my decade long struggle and asked them for the help I desperately needed. I've been free from opiates for 2 years now and I just want to tell anyone struggling or headed down that road that it's easy to get lost in it all when things don't seem that bad. Problem is, once things do get bad and overwhelming it's almost too late. Don't be afraid to seek help if you feel you need it and really try to examine why you use the way you do.

I only say this because I want to help you to be able to continue to experiment as much as you want, and to always have a healthy relationship with drugs.\n\nOne thing is, be careful making drug use your main personality trait. I think once it becomes the focus of our life and our favorite thing, thinking about it all the time, it's really hard to stay on a good path. There should always be things in life that matter to you more than drugs (college, career, family, whatever passions you have).\n\nAnd most importantly, don't be afraid to know when it's time to step back, slow down, take a break, not do that crazy drug you're thinking about trying. If you're strong enough to know when to draw the line, or to recognize when things are getting out of hand and take a step back, that can make the difference between becoming an addict and being a drug connoisseur. It would even be good to just take a break from drugs completely from time to time. Take a week sober and see how it feels. If it's really hard to do that, maybe something's wrong. \n\nI realised a big reason I was an addict was because even when it started doing me harm, I couldn't stop. I knew logically I shouldn't do it, but the cravings took over. I was an addict even when I wasn't using \"addictive\" drugs, I would always find something so that I didn't spend a single day sober (if I ran out of weed and all I had was acid, then I would take the acid that day).

So essentially because you're interested in researching drugs you become quite knowledgeable about things like dosages, interactions and harm reduction. A lot of the time, someone who has this interest will start to kind of  believe that due to their knowledge they're out of the reach of addiction in a sense. Addiction doesn't discriminate, and this belief leads one to a false sense of security so they will fail to realise the signs of addiction or the forming of habits when they begin. It's not a guarantee by any means but it is an identifiable pattern.\n\nAs for me I became interested in drugs when I was about 12 years old. Began both doing them and reading everything online I could find about them. I was all about harm reduction, after a while they sort of became such a normal part of my life that I became very comfortable and stopped respecting them. Now I'm not a junkie by any means. I hold down a job, am doing a good degree and have a good social life. I also abuse drugs on a regular basis and have a few habits that I find extremely hard to control. Compulsions to get high, especially when I'm drinking, that I will almost always cave to and then go on a bender until the money runs out or I have some sort of obligation like school or work. While these habits are not having too much of an impact in my life currently, I suspect this impact is going yo grow and become quite a problem.\n\nAlso worth a mention that I think this is quite a drug specific thing, if you stay away from the habit forming ones and stick to psychs you're much less likely to have a problem.

I remember being shown nonsensical stuff like this in school and believing it until i decided to learn for myself how it all works.\n\nFor anyone who doesn't understand why psychedelic addiction is implausible (or at the very least, *incredibly* unlikely) I'll explain real quick.\n\nPsychedelics don't actually \"make\" you feel anything, they simply amplify how you already feel. If you feel like shit and take acid, you will 9/10 times have a pretty fucking horrific trip. Additionally, the suppression of the DMN in your brain is conducive to allowing selfless evaluation of your life an actions, the same way an outside observer would. Your judgement isn't clouded by your own biases and emotional defenses, you're able to see yourself from the outside, then carry those observations with you once you're sober.\n\nFor example, I've had severe depression for 15 years. I basically feel like shit permanently. I genuinely don't find tripping to be euphoric or \"fun\". For me, it's like going to therapy. Am i going to enjoy it? Probably not. Will it help me learn and grow as a person so in the future I can solve my own problems? Most definitely.\n\nIf you were to become \"addicted\" to psychedelics, you wouldn't be unaware of it, or be able to hide it from yourself with emotional defenses. You would be 100% aware that what you're doing is hurting you and ruining your life. You would be completely unable to find any justification or defense to keep up the illusion that this is good for you. You wouldn't experience good trips anymore. Your subconscious will beat you over the head with how much of a fucking dumbass you are until you learn your damn lesson.\n\nI've done very heavy psychedelics, i've met and spoken to entities, felt full ego death, etc. The entities are not \"otherwordly beings\" they're manifestations of your own psyche. If you do dumb shit, no matter how hard you try to hide it from yourself, you can't hide it from the entities.\n\nIf you abuse psychedelics, the entities are gonna fucking curbstomp your ego and beat you with tire irons in your own personal psychedelic purgatory so you'll stop being such a jackass.\n\nI continue to do psychedelics even though i don't enjoy them much *because* of this effect. The entities point out all my flaws and mistakes and toxicity and that motivates me to fix it. Because of psychedelics i have empathy and compassion for others, I don't constantly put myself down for minor mistakes, I stopped drinking, quit smoking, I exercise, eat healthy, go out in the sun, forgive people who wronged me, etc.\n\nPsychedelics can be fun and silly and recreational at low doses, sure. But once you use them in heroic doses, they'll pull every negative aspect of you out, roll them together like a newspaper, and smack you with them over and over and over again until you stop being such a fucking dumbass.\n\nWhen you fix what's wrong with you, then come back, the entities will stop doing that. They'll be friendly and happy and jovial. They cant beat you with your flaws if there's not enough of them to make into a weapon. \n\nIf you abuse psychedelics, you're just giving the entities ammunition to beat your ass with, and they'll continie doing it until you take that ammunition away from them. If you dont use psychedelics responsibly, they'll become a horrifying nightmare drug that'll scare you into fixing yourself so that you never have to endure a beating like that again.\n\nDo not piss off the entities, they know your flaws because they're you, and they don't care about your excuses, they'll fucking smash your head against your flaws like a paddleball until you learn your damn lesson, and not a moment before that.", "replies": {}}}}, "ftav56x": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/gydy9x/im_a_substance_user_not_abuser/ftav56x/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1591590865.0, "body": "lmao stop deluding yourself you junkie /s", "replies": {}}}}, "ftbid3s": {"score": 4, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/gydy9x/im_a_substance_user_not_abuser/ftbid3s/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1591603810.0, "body": "Sound like something an abuser would say", "replies": {}}, "ft9zfw9": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/gydy9x/im_a_substance_user_not_abuser/ft9zfw9/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1591573752.0, "body": "F Y I !!

They may seem alright to fuck with every once I'm a while, and maybe they are, every person has their weaknesses and drug of choice that can turn a drug user into and addict before they ever know it happened. Drugs cant be evil because they are just chemicals. But they can be addictive and dangerous no matter how much knowledge you have or how safe you are with your usage. Some people are more predisposed to becoming an addict than others. I also know people who can use all drugs with moderation and they have never had a problem with wanting to constantly be on drugs. But most people think they are the one who wont have a problem and a lot of them end up as a junkie. \n\nReally it all comes down to being honest with yourself in my opinion.

I've done some really good clean acid and ate some bomb ass shrooms in my 6 years of experimentation but I've also had 4 drugs enter my system under the assumption they were another across those years. Like the one time my once friend smoked a bowl of shitty looking weed with me that turned out to be posh. Fuck him. And fuck anyone that lies about what you're selling. Obviously I'm not dead and I'm not addicted to anything but my weed so no harm no foul. But just because you do your research doesn't mean you're getting the drugs you thought you were buying.

It really becomes an issue though when you begin to abuse drugs daily and frequently for prolonged periods of time.  Then you're asking for all sorts of trouble, some of which you can't foresee.

You may be able to use Benzos once a week for a year and life may be relatively good until something particularly stressful pops up in your life, then you can be the strongest willed person and still begin using them as a crutch to get through life.  Part of why is because you simply can't know just how serious those warnings you heard from former drug users were unless you really been through addiction.  Once you're dependent, you'll most likely suffer in ways you couldn't possibly think of, well beyond just the withdrawals which can be a hell themselves beyond your imagination.  It's true that drugs are a lot less harmful than we make them out to be as a society and there is a lot of fear mongering where there shouldn't be.  Doesn't mean they're by any means perfect and they should be respected and treated as something serious.

I would smoke weed daily in high school, and do alcohol and other drugs recreationally on occasion. I was always told that drugs are okay in moderation and should be used as \"tools\". By age 17 I started using adderall daily to preform better in school and to get a jump start in college when I started. Adderall was my first addiction, as I used it daily and formed a dependence on it. By age 19, I started using opioid/opiate pain killers for actual pain (nerve damage in mouth and face) and also found that they helped my comedowns tremendously and made me feel very good. Long story short, that's when my addiction really begun. I would use both adderall and pain killers together, mainly hydrocodone or tramadol/codeine when I didn't have it. And I would need to take higher doses of both to even out some of the effects. After a about 6 months of using that combo, I started adding gabapentin and alcohol to that combo to increase my effects. I was an addict at this point. I would get so fucked up every night to the point where I would pretty much black out as soon as my head would touch a pillow lol. I also started to get opioid induced sleep apnea, and I would wake up 6-10 times gasping for air and most nights. I was a walking stick figure (98 pound male) and was failing at every form of life. My gf that was living with me seen what was happening, but I always lied to her. Well one night, I accidently overdid it...I had mixed adderall, tramadol, codeine, gabapentin, and tequilla with a little over 200 mgs of THC edibles. To say the least, I got very sick and my mom thought I was Overdosing, since she knew I used opioids. She told my gf to find my pills in our room and give them to her to flush.

I've gone through almost 3 ozs of kratom in these 4 days. I'm also using Suboxone sparingly but the kratom has helped. I only used heroin for 3 months but let me tell you if you plan on using this substance withdrawals WILL be a bitch. \n\n I used consistently once I started using for back pain. I had not planned on being addicted as I'm sure most people don't. Now the first time I used was probably about a week or two before I got hooked. I was mad about a some bullshit and needed to get it off my mind. I don't know why but I was like \"you know what fuck it I'm doing heroin\" well it was fentanyl not heroin and I got high as shit. I thought it was pretty great but not all it lived up to be. The fent was too strong and I did too much to really enjoy the high. I was out in minutes. \n\nNow when I started using for back pain I wasn't even getting very high at first. For probably the first week I only used a very small dose at work when my back would start hurting. After the first week or so I started doing bigger dose and getting high as fuck. Man it was great I never really found love, not that I didn't have luck with the lady's more so then I just idolized rock stars and one night stands became my only sex life. And when I did have sex some time's the chick would fall in love. I'd string them along for a few days and then move on. I'd laugh at the thought I was kinda a sociopath, and the idea of a good girl falling for a drug addict like myself was humorous to me. When I started getting high on heroin I thought \"oh shit this must be what love feels like, fuck I feel bad for fucking with those chicks, I couldn't imagine this feeling leaving\" \n\nI knew I was in trouble 3 weeks in me and all my friends were making regular trips to the dope boy's block now. 3 quarters of my money was going to the dope boy for crack and heroin, one quarter was going in gas just to get there. Man it was the shit tho, I was head over heels for my new love and I didn't want to stop floating on her cloud. I had a girl once tell me \"when I'm with you I feel like I'm in a dream, like I'm thousand miles away from everything and my problems just seem to melt away\" it always stuck with me cause I thought how can someone feel like this? I wish I had something that would make me feel that high and take my problems away. Then I found my island paradise love of my life. There it was the feeling I always looked for sold in a little capsule for 20 bucks a piece. \n\n2 months in I was on top of the world I haven't had sex or meaning in my life for 2 months and that was fine. I worked so I could get high I got high so I could work and round and round we went. Me and heroin had a beautiful simple relationship. She hadn't done me wrong and I was in bliss. I felt as all of this was a dream that was too good to be true. People would say I have a problem and I'd reply nah I just like to party. My parents were concerned with my weight loss and lack of interest in anything. I'd go days with no contact with the outside world. But those days might have well been minutes in my eyes. I was living the fast life cocaine, booze, acid, dmt, molly, crack, and of course my love and my new life heroin. To me the biggest difference between heroin and all the other drugs is there come a point very quickly and without warning that heroin becomes everything to you. It was all I ever wanted, no one could hold me tighter and love me harder then heroin could. Heroin was my superman, she could save me from all this bullshit, she could take the weight off my shoulders.\n\nBy the 3rd month things began to fall apart, and fast. I lost my job I was back in with my parents my best friend had oded twice and most people wanted to stay as far away from me as possible. My parents found my stash and here I am now 4 days off heroin. Physical withdrawals are a bitch. Late into day one I'm curled up in a ball on my floor with a bucket puking sweating gallons of sweat. Every bone in my body hurts feels like their being drilled into with a hammer drill. The pain really took me off guard because like I said I only used for 3 months. My dad would come in and tell me to shut up and stop being dramatic... I broke a lot of my shit. At one point I jumped in my car to head to the block doc just to head back because I didn't have money. I was crying and shaking puking and was positive I was going to die. My body cried out for heroin. I ate over an ounce of kratom and it helped a little but not by much. I fell asleep just after the sun came up from physical exhaustion and it also been long enough for me to take a Suboxone. My knuckles bleeding and swollen from punching the floor. I woke up a few hours later. I only had 2 Suboxone so I knew I had to make them last.id only take quarters at a time since they were 8 milligrams. It was just enough to hold me over. \n\nDay two was lonely and depressing and still painful. My body hurts so bad every bone my fucking teeth everything. Just a dull but still excruciating body ach. The worst was the legs!! Man it drove me crazy I was exhausted but couldn't sit still. The subs helped alot tho. By the end of day 2 I only had a quarter of a sub left and I knew the next day was going to be rough. I stayed up all night no sleep just smoking weed.\n\nDay three I ate my sub first thing in the morning and went to go to a meeting. Of course there are no meeting because of Corona. By the time my sub wore off I was back in pain and wishing I'd just die. The worst part is the heart break. Day three is when the reality of no heroin really kicked in l. I'll never have her love again. It felt like the love of my life had just left me. All I want is to feel her in my veins one more time. For her to run her warm fuzzy fingers across my brain and down my spine. After all no could ever hold me tighter or love me harder then heroin. Just a sinking desperate feeling in my chest it actually made me nauseous the idea of never doing heroin again. I loved heroin and surely she loved me too. I spent the rest of the day eating kratom and smoking weed just pretending to be high on dope again. Reminiscing on all our memories together and sinking lower and lower. I wanted to kill myself. I tied my belt to my door knob and left it there and stared at it for hours. I couldn't do it though I don't really wanna die. Well anyways my friend got me another sub so I took a quarter smoked some weed ate some kratom.\n\nDay 4 I had emotionally shut off, I made myself numb. That's what I always did with my parents or friends when they hurt me. But being shut off only puts the pain away. I know soon I'll have to face this demon again if I really plan on staying off heroin. My physical pain from withdrawals are still there but they are beginning to fade. Finally I'm starting to feel a little normal again. Far from all the way but it's a start forsure. I can actually see this working now. In the beginning this seemed like such a long haul. The days were long and painful and seemed to drag on infinitely. The idea of never getting high again made my skin crawl. Now I still have a long way to go but it seems doable.

For a year, it gave me my life back despite multiple chronic health conditions otherwise making me non-functional. I was an IV user for a little over a year, and fuck do I miss it. It really is like the best love of your life, and I really wish I never knew it at all. I never aimed to use it recreationally, only in small (but frequent) doses, and I stuck to that throughout the entire affair. Other than the 2 times I overshot the dose and got tired, I never did enough to get sleepy from it, and it was like the best source of energy I've ever found. I've never been nearly as productive in my entire life than when I was properly opiated. \n\nThen I swore off of it for financial reasons, and out of fear of eventually getting in trouble legally, since that was about the only way my life was going to get worse. A \"quit while I'm ahead\" mentality. And it was much easier than I expected to get off of it and stay off of it, with the trick being I knew to cut contact with anyone who used since I knew they'd risk roping me back into the life just because they wanted a ride. Thanks to kratom, I barely even had much of a withdrawal. But years later I know all the kratom has just been delaying most of it. I quit my 55mg/day Oxycodone prescription with just a rapid taper over 3 days and it wasn't nearly as bad as it could have been, but it's still nothing I'm going to willingly go through until it's forced on me for some reason.  \n\nBut the hardest part for you is still ahead of you. Getting clean is fucking EASY compared to STAYING clean. You're going to get little warm fuzzy flashbacks to it, followed by immense cravings that will never truly leave you alone. You've known the warmth, and you're going to have to resign yourself for the rest of your life to stay cold. I made that clean break over 3 years ago, and literally every fucking post that mentions any opiates at all still triggers a serious physiological and psychological response in me that where if I had any easy access to it, I'd fucking do it. \n\nCut yourself off from ALL possible sources. Delete numbers. Change phone numbers if any dealers have you number, because they WILL contact you. Hopefully you don't remeber how to get to your dealer's place, becsuse you'll probably have to move out of state if you start struggling. After a year it gets a little better, but that mark has permanently been left on your soul. \n\nOn the bright side, if you actually get off all opioid maintenence drugs, then you can just take some kratom and it'll get you pretty damn high.

Are you ready?\nI was on codeine, tramadol, benzos, dxm, weed, alcohol since I was 13 AND it climaxed when I was 16. I chose to admit myself in a psych ward for benzo and opiate dependency. I stayed for a month. long story short, at 17 started shooting up ( Ketamine IM) and in less than 6 months of first using the needle, I was doing #3 Afghan IV.  to cut to the chase, I was in jail for drug offences and put on substitution (8 mg sub/day) for about one year. I tapered the subs myself (easy if you spread and snort the dose properly) over 3 months. I was on 1-2 mg every other day and then I went to the clinic to stop, in case I got withdrawals. I didn't, just very mild ones. I was clean for a while until the depression and lack of desire to live overcame me. I went and started methadone, 10 mg then 15 then 20. doc wouldn't give me more. It was ok-ish but I always wanted more. Started IV-ing them and upped my dose to 40 mg/day and took codeine and dihydrocodeine ( up to 1 gram a day of codeine or 680 of DHC) when I ran out of methadone... \nThat was a brief background of my opioid addiction, for better understanding of the situation. \nHow did I kick it? Trust me, I got to 60 mg of methadone/day IV and it's the devil. I topped that with 3 to 5 80 mg oxy, also IV. So my tolerance was sky high, just imagine 400 mg oxy to cope when I didin't get Mdone. Not even pure fentanyl (except carfentanil and sufentanyl which I have tried, but just for very short periods of time) can be more horrifying.\n Now to the detox and cure. You will need DXM and Loperamide.  DXM is a great NMDA antagonist (dissociative), but also works on different other receptors (like opioid receptors, too), it's a \"dirty\" drug - non specific. It will flush most of the remaining heroin from your receptors, lower the tolerance and threshold, increase your serotonin levels and over all helping with all the nasty symptoms. There are DXM calculators online, depending on your weight, you'd want an upper second plateau ( almost 3).That will do the trick. For the day being, take metoclopramide and don't eat before the dxm, that way you won't experience nausea. Put yourself in a comfortable setting, music, maybe a friend to join you during the experience. I bet the only honorable effects will be the robo like walk and closed eyes visuals. After about 6 hours since the trip began, get something like quetiapine(seroquel) or levomepromazine or any benzo to put yourself to sleep. NO ALCOHOL AT ALL!!! \nPhase 2: Loperamide (Immodium), you will need it for the next day after you wake up from te dxm trip. Get 50 mg (25x 2 mg pill or capsule). Black ground pepper - one spoonful. Omeprazol- 40 mg. Cimetidine or dyphenhydramine (2 pills of either). Tonic water (quinine) \nHow to take them:T-1 hour start by taking the omeprazole and cimetidine/dph with a glass (330 ml) tonic water\nT-30 minutes take the black ground pepper in a parachute or put it in capsules with another 330 ml of tonic water\nT:00 Take the loperamide with a glass of water with one teaspoon of sodium bicarbonate dissolved in it.\nthis will take all of your acute WD away, if done correctly.\nNow for the depression (dopaminergic pleasure pathway and neurochemical depletion) that will come after a few days from the dxm and loperamide treatments, I suggest taking another 20 mg loperamide the following day (after 40 mg) plus an antidepressant (mirtazapine before sleep, 15 mg or half of remeron). If you don't have access, go to a doctor and tell them that you have a depressive episode and need something to help you sleep. I bet you'll find something.\nwith this, it will be over . for good. I suggest you take some gabapentin or pregabalin for the next 30 days, starting with either 900 mg gabapentin a day (3 x 300 1-1-1) or with pregabalin also named lyrica 300 mg/day (2x 150 mg 1-0-1).\nMate, I promise if you keep at it and find support from family, being honest about who you really are, being transparent with the doctors and the people who want to help you, along with psychotherapy or whatever healthy habits you will find, YOU'LL BE A PERFECTLY HAPPY, HONEST, ACCOMPLISHED  AND LOVED PERSON.

It was probably the most innocent thing. Maybe you had a surgery and wanted to see how it felt or just liked how it felt. You get that warm and fuzzy feeling like nothing could be better. \n\nNext thing you know you're asking a friend who sells you a couple. You take them on and off because it feels good. You probably forgot about your childhood trauma or the anxiety and depression you used to have. All you know is that this pill is making everything so much better. You start spending more money and getting them more often.\n\nNow people might be warning you that you're going down a bad path. You don't believe them because you have it all under control. People start saying things, like \"this shit doesn't discriminate, be careful\". Oh but you have it all under control, addiction could never happen to me. I have a good life, good job, the perfect fiance, nah that would never happen.\n\nFast forward maybe a year, now you're taking triple of what you started with. It was on and off but you accidentally went on a binge. Maybe things have been tough at work or in your personal life. So this binge lasts maybe 4 days. You get minor withdrawals but it's no big deal right? Now you know that you can go this many days without feeling terrible. So then you push it a little further and instead of 4 days now it's a week and a half maybe two.\n\nAt this point, you feel like absolute dog shit. You go back to the plug and get some Suboxone or subutex. You start taking it for the withdrawals. Soon you find yourself dependent on the subs. You're taking them every day and at a pretty high dose because you still want to feel relaxed.\n\nDays turn to weeks, weeks turns to months, and before you know it you've been taking Suboxone for a year. Of course inbetween you're dabbling with the oxy or opiate of choice.\n\nA year on Suboxone now and all those childhood traumas, the anxiety, the depression, it's all coming to light. You've lost motivation in anything and everything. You don't enjoy the things you used to. You're sitting back watching life pass you by thinking you have no purpose in life.\n\nOne day, you get sick of feeling like you're wasting your life. So you decide to stop taking Suboxone, however, you have no idea what you're doing or how to do it. You just know that you need to stop so you quit cold turkey.\n\nEach day that goes by you feel worse and worse. You keep telling yourself that tomorrow will be better. Eventually you've gone a few weeks and tomorrow hasn't came. You've tried anything and everything to help with withdrawals.\n\nThat's when it really hits you... Why did I do this to myself. Why did I let myself get to this point. HOW did I get to this point?! This could NEVER happen to me!! \n\nBut yet you're sitting there sick... Your new truck has been reposessed...You're a month behind on your mortgage.. and all you can do is sit there praying you feel better tomorrow... When will tomorrow come?\n\nPlease, if anyone is on here reading this, please, I'm literally begging you to think twice before you dive into this terrible world of opiates. It's not worth all that is to follow. Go smoke weed or something if you want to get high and relax. This path of opiates is one of disaster and heartache. You will lose personal belongings, money, your friends, your family, and most of all yourself. It's not worth it. I'm sure you'll do what you want, as did I, but please just consider the consequences.", "author": "cntdueitalone", "score": 654, "flair": null, "created": 1582814625.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/fa824i/the_opiate_story/", "num_comments": 95, "title": "The Opiate Story", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fiwixla": {"score": 103, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/fa824i/the_opiate_story/fiwixla/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1582816608.0, "body": "Well stated", "replies": {}}, "fiwk9js": {"score": 66, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/fa824i/the_opiate_story/fiwk9js/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1582818253.0, "body": "Thank you.

I need advice .. Ik y\u2019all don\u2019t know me .. but I\u2019m a senior in high school and  I struggle to stop using ..(Here is a back story ) last year my junior year was  one of the worst years of my life .. I was extremely depressed and insecure.. I don\u2019t know where this came from really but I just became unhappy with my life .. I have tried coke the summer before junior year and I only did it twice .. I kept replaying those moments in my head for weeks .. something about that Euphoric feeling I had .. made me want it so bad .I knew I wanted to do it just like once on a random weekend and that was supposed to be it .. sadly it wasn\u2019t .. I already knew my dealer through my friends I tried it with originally.. he was very generous with me .. he likes me and liked talking to me ..Finally a weekend came where I was free to do anything .. me and my dealer met up at a Walmart .. I remember I was speeding there bc I was so excited to feel good about myself again and to not gaf about anything but enjoying that high .. I bought 40 dollars worth .. it was 1pm Saturday . I immediately headed home and went straight to my room ,locked the door ,and turned on music to make sure I was good to go .. my parents knew I used to hide and smoke weed in my room and it took a long time to earn there trust back .. They even took my door off the hinges for 6 months .. I had gained my freedom and privacy back .. and know looking back on it I wish my parents didn\u2019t give me freedom .. it would eventually lead to destruction.I opened the bag and poured some on my old iPad .. I took my time breaking up the little chucks making sure it was a fine powder ... I ended up making 4 medium sized lines .. I sat there for a moment staring at it ,admiring it .. this is the just the beginning.. I grabbed a tampon from my bathroom and took the stem off and used it for my \u201cstraw\u201d .. i did the first line and I immediately got chills over my entire body .. it was amazing .. I quickly did the other 3 lines then continued to lick any residue off my credit card and iPad .. the numbing sensation was great .. at first .. I laid back on my bed and stared at the ceiling .. I immediately felt like I was on top of the world ... I felt like I could do anything and nothing could stop me . I stayed locked in my room blaring music and dancing in my mirror .. I eventually ran through that bag in under 2 hours.. I met with my dealer again .. I got 80 . I rushed back home and immediately starting making lines .. my heart was racing so fast I thought it was going to pop out of my chest .. oddly enough I liked it .. I made six fat lines and did them all immediately.. at this point I\u2019m really high .. I\u2019m shaking and sweating a lot .. I get on Snapchat and was shocked at what I had seen .. my pupils were almost completely dilated.. I was scared.. Whst if my parents call me into the living room .. i didn\u2019t leave my room for hours ..I did another 4 lines and was so high my vision began to change .. everything looked like it was bouncing around .. I realized I was soaked in sweat and needed a shower.. I ran the water and got in .. I played one of my playlist. I felt amazing.. the hot water and the music just made me never wanna get out .. I got out the shower and got dressed . It was late at night now and my stomach was growing like crazy .. that\u2019s when I realized I forgot to eat anything that day .. I didn\u2019t care tho all I could think about was coke .. I finished off the bag and stayed up all night ..this drug is  dangerous.. it changes you .. what was just supposed to be a one time thing turned into every weekend.. then some days during the week .. then every single day mutiple times a day .. I was so happy as long as I had coke Atleast every hour sometimes less .. when I didn\u2019t have it. All my depression and doubts came rushing back all at once ..I tried to get more but the amounts I was getting I kept running out of quicker and quicker .. I lied to my parents and told them I needed 250 for a part to my car .. they trusted me again so they had no doubts in what I was telling them .. I was so happy that I was able to get that much coke all at once. My dealer explained to me that a gram of the good shit was 100 I wanted more than that and he gave me 3.5 for 250.. I was so happy that I had enough coke to last me more than a couple hours .Fast forward 3 months I\u2019ve become a completely different person mentally and physically.. I had lost so much weight it made me sick to even look at myself.. I wasn\u2019t anoxic looking but I was quit slim and had lost all my curves .. I was straight up and down . My boobs even got smaller . I was doing up to 3 grams everyday and not sleeping at all on a school night I\u2019d get up when it got light outside and pile on makeup to hide how exhausting and sick I looked .. makeup helped a lot but I couldn\u2019t hide my extremely bones hands and my wrist bone poking through my skin .. I got stares a lot but I didn\u2019t care all I cared about was getting high .. I needed lines at school to keep myself normal. I wasn\u2019t myself without coke . That\u2019s how bad things had gotten .. even my dealer told me to slow down .. I would get so mad at him and would blow up his phone till he finally gave in and sold it to me .One  day it all changed .. It was a school night and I had and I had just done 2 grams in under 45 minutes.. I was so high I was tweaking . (If you\u2019ve ever done a large amount of the pure shit you know what I mean ) I had a friend that knew and kept my secret she was my savior. We can call her Sarah (not her real name ) she loved  coke just not as much as me . We would do it ever do often maybe like 3 times a week and only like 3 lines a piece. She would be high asf and I\u2019d be barley buzzed .My tolerance had gotten so high I needed either a gram in one line or about 6 or 7 lines of the really strong shit . The one thing I kept from Sarah was how much I was actually doing.  She thought that I would buy a gram and space it out for the entire week .. little did she know I\u2019d probably end up doing up to 21 grams or more of coke all by myself . I wanted to tell her so bad but I was scared she would make me stop and that scared me .. I couldn\u2019t function without it .. if I couldn\u2019t have it I didn\u2019t want to be alive . I couldn\u2019t deal with the comedowns .. they were excruciating and lasted up to a week or longer .. my comedowns were probably worse than other average users . My thoughts would consume me .. all of my suicidal thoughts were the main problem.. I could hear a person yelling at me to end it all rn .. my mind was telling me I was nobody. I\u2019m nothing but addict,and I believed every single word I was forced to listen too .. I laid flat on my back and looked down at what used to be a stomach . I was wearing a sports bra and spandex shorts ;when I looked down tears instantly started running down my face .. I was skin and bones .. my size small spandex was gaping away from my skin .. the reason they weren\u2019t saggy is bc my hip bones sticked out so bad it looked like I had bottle in my shorts .. I could almost fully wrap my hand around my hip bone .. My mindset instantly changed.. I saw Whst everyone else was seeing .. they were trying to help me go through whetever they thought I was going through .. I hated myself for that . I felt like my other friend weren\u2019t my friend they were dogs .. only sticking around me to see if the rumors at school were true . Which they were . I quit my job for a while .. I told my parents it was bc the managers were rude .. but in reality it was bc I needed to stop making money bc every cent went towards coke . I stopped using so much everyday and went to only using when ever I could make a little money .. my desire to eat started to increase I actually was thinking about what I wanted to eat instead of how much coke should I get today ? . Eventually I stopped completely and had a good few months .. if this gets slot of attention I\u2019ll make my story of what\u2019s going on currently", "replies": {"fj001c4": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/fa824i/the_opiate_story/fj001c4/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1582911415.0, "body": "I don't understand why/how people get hooked on expensive ass coke when amphetamine offers a comparable high that lasts way longer and is cheaper by orders of magnitude...", "replies": {}}, "fk8v4h3": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/fa824i/the_opiate_story/fk8v4h3/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1583992291.0, "body": "Man all I have to say Is be thankful it\u2019s just cocaine. I\u2019m not trying to ever downplay anyone else\u2019s addictions or issues however. I\u2019ve been on opiates for 13 years now. And the really bad ones for the last 6(fentanyl). Long story short I was doing 3-4 grams of the shit a day. Was living with my girlfriend at the time who developed a coke problem which I just happened to sell to feed my own addiction. I swear to god I would be sicker than anyone can even imagine after doing 3-4 G for months straight and then either not being able to get as much one day or waiting on money. Whatever the situation was that led me to being sick. \nWell if I didn\u2019t have mine and was struggling she didn\u2019t have hers because all her shit came from me. This girl I shit you not would lay in bed crying tears until she could get her little 20-40 of blow to get her day started. I would sit there with her and tell her it\u2019s 90% in her head. There\u2019s no way she needed to act like this and was just making things worse on herself overall. Well what do I know. I\u2019ve been doing drugs and going thru the horrible shit for almost half of the time this girl has been alive at that point. You think anyone would listen to me though? Fuck no. \nSo it got to the point to where I had to break up with her and get her the fuck out of my house. (A lot of other reasons that had built up over time as well) but the big one was because of the drugs. I would be so god damn sick literally not being able to function at all. When I would detox off those type of amounts I literally wouldn\u2019t be able to function at all. I can\u2019t drink at all. I damn sure can\u2019t eat anything. I can\u2019t sleep. I can\u2019t shower because my hot cold flashes are so bad when my skin gets wet it feels like acid eating it away. I can\u2019t sit still longer than a few minutes without freaking the fuck out. So you can only imagine with myself already going through these things and then having her ass start up with how she is so this and so that and she doesn\u2019t know how she is going to get over it. I would just look at her like man. At least promise me one thing. Promise me that you will never ever ever in your life take an opiate. Because if this is how you act and feel off not having fucking stupid ass cocaine man I couldn\u2019t even imagine what a normal withdrawal would do to you. \nI\u2019m a pretty tough dude. I def dont consider myself a bad ass or anything close to it. I just know how the detox and shit feels when your coming off so.... Idk. I just wanted to comment on that when i seen it.

So I\u2019m going to start this at the very beginning:\r\n\r\nAbout 2 years ago I was in the state prison system. Grew pretty close with this particular dude, and eventually moved him into my cell, where we got along well. Never even had a bad vibe from him, other than him being in prison for selling drugs. But who was I to judge when I\u2019m in there myself?\r\n\r\nFast forward to about a month ago. He hits me up on Facebook out of the blue. Finally, he got out. And he wanted to chill sometime. Said he was doing okay, working with a construction company. I thought: why not? I\u2019m not down with hanging with losers anymore. But if the guys got his life together, than we can smoke a blunt or two (I\u2019ve got my medical card). We ended up hanging out a few times over the last month. Met his girlfriend. Saw the place he works. Gave him a ride every once in a while to work and whatnot.\r\n\r\nMonday night - two days ago: I was doordashing, and planning on going until about 7 am. He hits me up at about 10 30 at night and asks if I wanted to come over to his house and smoke. I said sure, yeah, just let me finish this order and I\u2019ll be there in 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nI pull up at his house and he hops in. We go to wawa to grab a few blunt wraps. He\u2019s in a completely normal mood, same as always. Cool guy, at least I thought so at the time.\r\n\r\nWe head back to his house. According to him, his dad is a bit of a nazi and doesn\u2019t like having people over, so I don\u2019t park in front of the driveway. It\u2019s late, dark, and very quiet. I follow him around the side of the house, to the back porch. His girlfriend is waiting there for us. She seems nice but I hadn\u2019t talked to her much, besides the normal hey how you doing.\r\n\r\nMy \u201cfriend\u201d says he has something he wants to show me. It\u2019s what he called a gravity bong. (Im sure some of you might be familiar with it). I\u2019m fascinated with how it works. I watch as he packs the huge bowl full of bud - it was dark but it definitely looked like decent bud. Darker than the shit I get but hey, every strain is different.\r\n\r\nI take this huge hit. The taste of it seems a bit off. Chemical. I couldn\u2019t put a finger on it, but I figured it was just the bong water itself. And I\u2019m not too familiar with drugs. My hardest times were an addiction to prescribed Xanax years ago while I was in the army, suboxone I currently take for leg pain (doctor isn\u2019t a big fan of putting people on percs or oxy), and marijuana.\r\n\r\nI blow it out. My \u201cfriend\u201d - with this creepy smile on his face - says \u201coh by the way bro, there was in meth in it.\u201d I tell him to stop fucking around, and that I know he wouldn\u2019t do that.\r\n\r\nBut he keeps smiling and says, \u201cI\u2019m serious bro, it\u2019s meth. Here, take a look for yourself.\u201d And he points to the tray he\u2019d broke the weed up on earlier.(remember, it was dark). I put my face inches from it and notice little clear/white crystal shards sprinkled throughout the bud.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment I\u2019m feeling my heart speed up in my chest, and a flash of heat shoot through my body at an alarming rate..\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s where things get weird: I can\u2019t really remember anything after that. Or I CAN remember a little and what I do makes no sense at all. So maybe some of you guys - with personal knowledge or medical experience - can help me get some answers to my questions.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s what I DO remember from that night; and keep in mind that all of this took place between about 11 pm and 4 a:\r\n\r\nI remember walking through the woods, and following this dude and his girl, but can\u2019t remember the reason.\r\n\r\nI remember him convincing me that he was Jesus, returned to save everyone that was going to heaven. According to him I was \u201ca good person\u201d and hearing this made me cry. I also remember telling him that I\u2019ve always tried to be a good person, and I\u2019m so glad he could see that. How he convinced me : he was able to basically control my mind, and speak to me with out actually speaking, telepathically, I suppose.\r\nI just had this profound feeling that he WAS Jesus and that I was safe.\r\n\r\n\r\nContinuing off of that, I remember us walking and talking for quite some time. And as we walked I saw angels in the woods. They were completely black figures, shadows really, wearing bright golden belts and helmets, and carrying golden harps. From what I can recall, this walk was a story of my life, and my last moments before I\u2019d be \u201cdead\u201d and follow him into heaven. Several times throughout the walk I saw family members waving goodbye, my eight year old daughter, friends, my girlfriend. But I wasn\u2019t upset. It felt okay. Like I was headed to something greater than this world..\r\n\r\nI remember having a strong urge to run as fast as I could. Several fleeting memories of me charging full speed through this dudes neighborhood in the middle of the night, through random backyards, and one time even running so fast I couldn\u2019t stop in time to avoid some patio furniture. Sent it clattering to the ground, and I took off in fear of waking someone up, being caught, etc. and I was HOT, drenched in so much sweat it was like I\u2019d just jumped into a swimming pool.\r\n\r\nI remember my \u201cfriend\u201d telling me that he had a surprise for me. What is it?, I asked. He said he\u2019d have to show me . So apparently we got in MY car (him driving, which I\u2019d never allow in my right mind), and go down the street to another house. He says he\u2019s been doing good in life, so well that he wanted to give me this house. I was overcome with joy. I\u2019m pretty sure I cried. Didn\u2019t know how to thank him enough. He actually pulled out his phone to record my reaction, asking me how I felt about all this. Of course I said it was amazing and I felt amazing. The whole thing seemed like he was going to put it on YouTube or Facebook.\r\n\r\nI remember him asking to use my phone. Of course I said yes and he took it. It wasn\u2019t until 45 minutes later I asked for it back. Probably because I was in no way shape or form acting like myself. And he laughed and said he\u2019d forgotten about it.\r\n\r\nI remember looking at my phone later and seeing a message on it that I\u2019d never once seen on an iPhone before: this iPhone has been disabled; please try again in 5 minutes. But 5 minutes later it wouldn\u2019t work either. It wouldn\u2019t end up working until much later.\r\n\r\nI remember my \u201cfriend\u201d coming to see me out in the car 2 times throughout the night. He kept asking me if I wanted to get out and get some fresh air. I said no - not because I didn\u2019t want fresh air but because I could hardly move. (This probably saved the car from being stolen in the long run - thinking about it now I realize that he probably already had the keys at that point). I did ask him for water, I was so fucking sweaty and thirsty. But he never brought it.\r\n\r\nAt 3:45 I vaguely remember coming to. I was inside my car, laying back in the drivers seat. My phone was about to die. And my girlfriend had been texting me and calling me all night, worried about me. Apparently I had only sent a couple msges to her during all that time: none of them making any sense whatsoever. For example: her; where the fuck are you!?! It\u2019s 3 am and you\u2019re still not home! Are you in danger?? And me; babe, hskdfn rs. I\u2019m guessing that I couldn\u2019t actually respond with anything coherent because I was too fucked up. I do remember my fingers not working right, words not typing the way I truly wanted them to.\r\n\r\nI had 2 percent left so I needed to charge my phone ASAP. I looked for my keys to start the engine up. Gone. Nowhere to be found. Using my limited battery supply, I tried to call my \u201cfriend\u201d who was inside the house with his girlfriend - he\u2019d told me earlier that I couldn\u2019t come in because of his dad, and I was still parked outside the house.\r\n\r\nHe answers and tells me he doesn\u2019t know where my keys are, and hangs up.\r\n\r\nI have 1 percent left. My girl had been asking me all night where I was and I think I just couldn\u2019t figure out how to give her my locatiion because of my fucked up mind. So literally seconds before my phone died, I snapped a pic using Time Stamp Camera, along with a frantic message asking for help. And sent it off.\r\n\r\nA little sleep followed.  I woke up when it was still dark to voices outside the car. Cops. 2 of them. They were peering into the car with flashlights - I could see the harsh light through my eyelids - and debating wether or not I had overdosed on dope, wether they should break the window and get me. I reacted to their knocking on the window by rolling over and pretending to go back to sleep. They decided to let me be and drove off. I was so relieved. I can\u2019t have any negative interactions with the police. \r\n\r\n\r\nSlept again. Then I woke with the early morning sun in the sky. There were people peering looking in the windows of my car again. I guessed that they were neighbors who had heard me running around like a lunatic all night, knocking over furniture. But I would get up and look only to find out that no one was actually there. I closed my eyes- I couldn\u2019t go anywhere anyway with no keys, and my mind not right - and heard a screeching engine outside after a few minutes. Using the little bit of energy I had remaining, I sat up. It was my girlfriend, getting out of an unfamiliar car. But I didn\u2019t know if it was her or my mind making it up. And at this time some of the memories from the night before were surfacing, and they made me very confused.\r\n\r\nI got out of our car and ran up to her. She was real. Our hug, her smell, her hair against my face. There\u2019s no way it couldn\u2019t be the authentic Liz. Turns out she\u2019d hopped in an Uber. She screamed at me for about 20 minutes and I told her what I could remember; The main point being that my \u201cfriend\u201d had laced the weed with meth.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to call the cops. I said no. Despite this dude doing some very fucked up shit, I had no desire to call 911. Not my way of solving problems, especially when I\u2019m a convicted felon. \r\nBut at the same moment - a strange coincidence if there ever was one - a random patrol unit was passing by and my girlfriend runs up to it, telling him that we need assistance.\r\n\r\nI should mention that at this time that my physical state was terrible. Every muscle hurt. My eyes felt like they were about to explode. Not to mention that my Jordan sneakers were covered in mud, grass clinging to my jeans. And there was also the clenching of my teeth, my weird way of talking that made no sense. Eyes darting around like a hungry fly.\r\n\r\nThe cop goes up to the house to knock on the door. No one answers. I\u2019m out on the street with my girlfriend and can actually see my \u201cfriend\u201d and his girl in windows, peeking between curtains. The cop, however, could see none of this, because he\u2019s at the front door.\r\n\r\nI just wanted to go home. But we needed the fucking keys. Apartment keys, car key, mailbox key, all of it was fucking gone, and instinctively I knew he had them. I just couldn\u2019t figure out how he got them - wouldn\u2019t be too hard a task with me all fucked up like that. And I could hardly remember anything anyway.\r\n\r\nMy girl tells the cop that they are in there, because she just saw them in the windows too - thank god it wasn\u2019t only me. So he keeps knocking, but still, no one answers.\r\n\r\nAn suv pulls up. It is my my \u201cfriend\u2019s\u201d dad, and he\u2019s more than a little overwhelmed by the police and us 2 standing on his front porch. The cop and my girl kinda tell him what\u2019s happened and he looks at me. I told him that I just wanted the keys. I couldn\u2019t fucking leave without them.\r\n\r\nHe goes inside. 30 seconds later \u201cmy friend\u201d comes out. Of course, he\u2019d been there the entire time. He denies having the keys. I have an uncontrollable urge to murder him for what he did, but I\u2019m not stupid enough to do it with a cop around. My \u201cfriend\u201d Gets in an argument with his father, his father screaming at him for lacing my weed with meth. He actually tells the cop to make him get his shit and get out of the house. I watch in a tired chance as he pulls off with his girlfriend.\r\n\r\nThe cop eventually leaves. We stay, talking to the father and searching the whole property for the keys. Since I could\u2019ve dropped them anywhere on the huge property (and possibly at a neighbor\u2019s if I really was running around) it took a long time, and we still found nothing. My girl would ask me, \u201cdo you remember being here at any time?\u201d And I would shake my head; I could hardly remember anything worthwhile besides being on the back porch and hitting the gravity bong - this is where we eventually found my hat.\r\n\r\nThen I noticed a bench. It was technically on the neighbors property, but the land behind it was vast, sloping down to a dried up creek and an open area of grass and leaves. It was familiar too me, the slope and the little clearing, and I mentioned this to the father. \u201cWhat the hell were you guys doing all the way down there\u201d he says. I can only shake my head, because though I could slightly remember following them through the woods, I couldn\u2019t remember what happened down there. This is fucking scary to me.\r\n\r\nThe father has an idea. Turns out he has three cameras on the house. One for the front door. One for the side/ garage. And one for the backyard, which is installed just above the door. He check his movement notifications. Here are the only three that stood out, all of which seem very significant to me:\r\n\r\nAt 3:37 am, on the backyard angle, you see me following them down the slope before we disappear out of view. Both of them are carrying flashlights and I am walking in a weird way, shambling like a drunken zombie.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later, at 3: 47 am, on the backyard angle, we can be seen coming BACK up the slope to the house. I am in the middle of them this time, clutching my head with both of my hands, near the temples, as if I\u2019m hurt or something bad just blown my mind.\r\n\r\nAt 4:22 am, on the front door angle, I can be seen trying to get into the front door. Probably my because I was hot and thirsty and had been stuck in the car for hours. But the door was locked, and I head back to the car with this sad look on my face.\r\n\r\nWhat is not on the camera is this : you never see me running through the front yard at full speed, and you never see my \u201cfriend\u201d coming out to the car twice, though I specifically remember it.\r\n\r\nWe don\u2019t find the keys. Eventually my girl and I are forced to pay 300 dollars to have a car key made on the spot. We drive home.\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, things got far worse later that day. I started hallucinating. It was terrible. I\u2019d see shadows under the front door. Movement in the peep hole, people outside waiting for me, people on ladders smiling into our windows ( we are on the top floor so a ladder would make sense) someone, my \u201cfriend\u201d, was coming after me. Apparently he\u2019d brought friends. I\u2019d hear them talking about it on the other side of the front door, about what they were going to do to my girlfriend when they got done killing me.\r\n\r\nThings moved in the apartment, caused by drilling through the walls; couch moving a couple inches, tv being lifted into the air. Even my peephole was blocked with the digital image of a bright red eye. Several times I thought there was somebody trying to sneak in through windows. The curtains would move, than I\u2019d see the shape of a foot, two feet. Little cameras with red eyes being drilled through the walls and pointed directly at me. At one point I was even convinced that they were going to crawl up through the sink/cabinet. I heard drilling under the sink and watched in horror as it began to lift a little, and the faucet began to control uncontrollably. Then I heard them talking again, deciding they were going to break through the wall of the neighbors apartment. The wall began to bow inwards, cracking in several places. I was convinced that someone was coming in and that they were going to kill me and the woman I love. The first time I heard them and saw the red eye in the peep hole, I ran to my girlfriend, who was on the phone with my troubled drug and alcohol counselor (she\u2019d just heard what happened the night before) and told her to call 911, that someone was about to break the door down. Of course she didn\u2019t do anything, and this frustrated me, only because I love her and had decided I\u2019d fight till the death to try and protect her. I couldn\u2019t understand why she didn\u2019t understand.\r\n\r\nMy only weapon was a hammer, which I wielded for the upcoming fight. For hours I paced back and forth behind the door. A few times when I heard them counting to 3 like they were about to hit the door, I actually shouted \u201ccome on you fucking pussies\u201d, and held the hammer up so I\u2019d hit the first motherfucker to come through. This caused some laughter on the other side. \u201cLook guys, he wants to fight\u201d someone said. I\u2019d forgotten about the little cameras and how they could see me.\r\n\r\nI actually watched the door come apart before my very eyes. Whatever tools they were implementing had me terrified: I\u2019d hear drilling and see a hinge come loose, hammering and see a little blade pop through the lock. Once, I ran back to the door with the hammer, and my girlfriend told me to stop, that it wasn\u2019t real, and I kinda pushed her out of the way, if only to protect her. I feel terrible about it..\r\n\r\nThat night, we finally went to bed. They were still at it, attempting to get through windows and the front door. When we shut the lights off they said \u201coh look guys he thinks he\u2019s going to bed\u201d and another said \u201che\u2019ll be sleeping when he\u2019s dead\u201d\r\n\r\nMy girlfriend was asleep, but I was up and alert. So many noises. Could still hear them at the front door banging and drilling. I could hear scraping at the window. The closet door would move a little and I was convinced they were crouching in the corner. They were talking about how hot my girlfriend was, how much they wanted to fuck her, and how she wouldn\u2019t want me anymore after they all ran a train on her. I saw movement under the blankets, like a hand, fondling my girl, and I would slap at it, only to have it disappear. I finally fell asleep with my hand over her privates: no one getting in there without killing me first.\r\n\r\nThe next day (today) I\u2019m feeling slightly better, I suppose. I\u2019m still a little paranoid, still seeing movement and hearing voices, though it\u2019s nowhere near as terrible as it was last night. No drilling in the sink, no moving furniture. The only thing I\u2019m noticing is the voices out there and shadows under the door and movement in the peephole. I know that I\u2019m being paranoid, but the same time, the dude is now my enemy, and he has the keys to our home, our car, and knows where we live. What if he actually does try to do something? Will my girl believe me when there\u2019s someone trying to break the door down?\r\n\r\nI have so many questions inside my head right now, all of them i might never get answers to:\r\n\r\nWas it only meth he slipped me? I don\u2019t know much about meth but I wouldn\u2019t imagine that one hit of meth, even from a gravity bong, could cause the hallucinations I experienced, including the paranoia I\u2019m still having. I remember teling him a while back that I had wanted to try DMT. Maybe he took that as he could slip it in and not tell me, like a surprise. Who knows? A dude who thinks it\u2019s okay to lace weed with meth is one fucked up eventually.\r\n\r\nWhat happened in the woods?  It\u2019s obvious they led me down there, and that we came back up ten minutes later, me holding my head. I\u2019ve been wondering if they either forced dmt or lsd down my throat or maybe offered it and lied about it was. I was so fucked up I\u2019d prolly just accept it. Or maybe I was so fucked up they told me it was dmt and I didn\u2019t care anyway.\r\n\r\nWhat was real and what wasn\u2019t? I can\u2019t help but wonder if, after we came back up the house from the woods, they just put me in my car and I hallucinated everything until I woke up. Maybe there was no running around like a wolf. No spiritual experience and meeting Jesus. No angels in a field and the peaceful feeling that I was about to die and go to heaven.\r\n\r\nWhy would he do something like this? I asked him this right before he got kicked out by his dad. I said I\u2019d always been good to you bro. When you needed something in prison I gave it to you. Food, coffee, whatever. So why? The phrase \u201ctrust no one\u201d has never been more relevant.\r\n\r\nWhy did he take my phone for those 45 minutes. And why take the keys? (I\u2019m convinced he has them at this point) to keep me trapped there all night in a hallucinatory hell - and a small bit of heaven? To come steal our car later? I\u2019ll probably never have any answers.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s like a puzzle, a puzzle I only have afew pieces of. Here\u2019s some information I learned that made me even more confused: I obviously know at this point that I was hallucinating the whole meeting Jesus, walking with angels thing. But the troubling part is this. Why did I get - and still have - a Facebook message from my \u201cfriend\u201d at 3 52 am of that night saying \u201cYou are going to hell\u201d ????\r\n\r\nAnd If I hallucinated my late night neighborhood run, than why did I wake up with mud covered shoes and grass all over my pants? Was it from walking through the woods or feeling like Superman?\r\n\r\nI\u2019d just assumed that my \u201cfriend\u201d had never taken me to that other house and told me he was giving it to me. It must be a hallucination, since I found out from his father that he\u2019s not doing so well financially and struggles with meth and heroin. But the weird part: I called my girlfriend that night out of nowhere. Apparently I was rambling on about how he was giving us a free house. So was I hallucinating the house while I was in the car and then picked up my REAL phone to call her?\r\n\r\nAnother thing: I\u2019ve never seen that message on my phone since, the one that said this iPhone has been disabled. Please try again in 5 minutes. So I\u2019d chalked it up as pure hallucination. But I\u2019m now convinced there\u2019s something else going on. Even my girlfriend agrees. During the time he had my phone, 3 calls were made. One to Illinois? One to florida, and one to Maine. And on top of that, my homepage for my browser is now completely changed, to a medical office I\u2019m convinced doesn\u2019t even exist - I went through the site a few times and noticed discrepancies.\r\nYesterday, in my paranoia, I knew without a doubt that he\u2019d put some kind of tracker or monitor on me. Today, slightly more clear headed, I honestly don\u2019t know what to think.\r\n\r\nAnd my last question I keep asking myself: what drug did he actually give me? Like I said before, I\u2019m not too certain it was just meth. I think he gave me meth on top of something else. The hallucinating was so REAL. I\u2019m not too familiar with psychedelics and how long they last. But I\u2019m still experiencing it almost 2 days later. The video from the backyard has me thinking that they somehow gave it to me down in the woods, and that I was clutching my head because I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing and experiencing. (I should mention now that I woke up today with an awful headache on both sides of my head. The very same place I was clutching my head in the video). Yesterday I thought they\u2019d put something in my brain, drilled in there somehow. Idk. Obviously that can\u2019t be true, can it?\r\n\r\nOr maybe it was just meth and it affected my brain in a negative way. Is that even possible? I already have PTSD from my time in Afghanistan, and I know some drugs can cause drug induced psychosis. Is that what I\u2019m experiencing right now? Psychosis? When the hell is it going to go away? Though it\u2019s better than yesterday, I fucking hate it, want it to end. Ugh.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m sitting there with the hammer. And my girl beside me.

I\u2019m sure I\u2019m still missing some from this list. I did not include supplements or nootropics.\n\nRatings\n\nWeed - 10/10\nEven though I have had tons of highs that were full of anxiety and paranoia, I\u2019ve had plenty that were great. It\u2019s very safe, versatile, and can potentiate pretty much ANY other substance.\n\nAlcohol - 4.5/10\nIts a dangerous substance overall and I hate the taste, but it comes in handy in many social situations. I would rate it at a 9 for the positive effects and a 1 for the negatives as the negatives are worse than just about any other substance I\u2019ve tried.\n\nCaffeine - 5/10\nHas it\u2019s used but still gives me a crash which is sometimes not worth it. Overall I\u2019m glad it\u2019s around.\n\nKratom - 7.5/10\nWith no tolerance and good leaf, I would say the rating is closer to a 9. With bad leaf the effects are more like a 1. It\u2019s a pretty safe alternative to more dangerous substances which is what gives it a higher overall score.\n\nMDMA - 8.5/10\nEuphoria is out of this world. It changed my whole perspective on music permanently. In the right setting, it\u2019s an unforgettable experience. It would be a 10 if it wasn\u2019t so unsafe. Once or twice a year is fine, but I abused it when I was younger and it made me feel more depressed and worse than ANY other drug ever has before or since. I will only use it in a candyflip now and just don\u2019t feel the need to use it anymore. I did have some incredible experiences on it though and I also loved the nystagmus. Comedowns can be awful too. \n\nMDA - 8.5/10\nLess euphoric than MDMA but I had some of the most unique visuals on it when combined with weed. Still very similar to MDMA.\n\nLSA -  4/10\nWaaay too tired on this. Tried both MGS and HBWR seeds. MGS made me so sick that the thought of it makes my stomach turn 10 years later. HBWR seeds gave me actual psychedelic effects, but it\u2019s so hard to stay awake. Doesn\u2019t really compare to classic psychs.\n\nDMT - 10/10\nHoly Shit. Even the most intense LSD trips of my life don\u2019t compare to vaping DMT. My reality was shattered for weeks following my first experience. I still can\u2019t believe people can experience this.\n\nSalvia - 1-10/10\nI don\u2019t know whether to give this a 1 or a 10. The experience was as intense as DMT but full of fear. I still think about my breakthrough experience even a decade later. Even though it\u2019s terrifying, it is one of the most fascinating psychedelics I\u2019ve ever tried.\n\nLSD - 9.5/10\nBy far my favorite long lasting psychedelic. The entire world comes alive, dancing with geometry. I\u2019ve had lasting life changing experiences from LSD and have quit other drugs because of it. Combination with MDMA is the best combo of all time IMO. The revelations and feelings of oneness are unforgettable. It would be a 10/10 if it wasn\u2019t for the comedown and after effects running into the next day or 2 for me. I still love LSD though and always will.\n\nMushrooms - 8.5/10\nI\u2019ve had some insane experience on mushrooms full of love. I usually feel better immediately after a trip than before. The comedown is always so euphoric but I usually feel more uncomfortable during the trip than with LSD. I don\u2019t think the visuals are as pretty either. The body load and sedation is what keeps this score lower than LSD... plus the fact that it\u2019s just simply not as enjoyable as a good LSD trip.\n\n25c-NBOMe - 2/10\nFeels way to intense in a dirty way. Put 2 of my friends in the hospital during one of our trips and gave another one of my friends a seizure. The first 2 times we did it were okay which is why it isn\u2019t a 1/10. It is a very hollow experience though. Would never try again.\n\nKetamine - 9/10\nLow doses are fun. High doses are insightful. The best part is that I feel great for a week after using it. IM is much more intense than intranasal. \n\nDXM - 6/10\nSurprisingly good for what you can get at a convenient store. Haven\u2019t touched it in years though. Ketamine just feels like the cleaner version. High dose just has so much mind fuck that it can be unbearable. Great combo with weed whippets and music though. I\u2019d say my few experiences ranged from terrible to blissful. It\u2019s hit or miss and sometimes you will get itchy AF! Ketamine is better though IMO.\n\nSynthetic cannabinoids (unknown) - 2/10\nOnly smoked these (K2 and whatnot) as a teen because weed was illegal. Actually felt addictive. Some experiences were fun, but overall it is just such a dirty experience. Weed is safer and overall WAY more fun!\n\nAdderall - 7/10\nVyvanse - 6.5/10\nNothing better for focus. I would smoke tons of cigarettes too. Always got a good amount of euphoria from it. Only thing that doesn\u2019t combine great with weed is stimulants though. Daily use lead to lack of motivation, sleep deprivation and occasionally psychosis after too much sleep deprivation. I got so skinny and so constantly tired that I haven\u2019t touched either of these in years. I can\u2019t stand upper comedowns anymore. It was fun for a while but overall no longer a fan.\n\nCocaine - 3/10\nFun while drinking ONLY but shit on its own. Short duration and barely any euphoria. Tried multiple times and still never got anything from it unless we were drinking.... in which case it just helped us drink more. \n\nRitalin - 1/10\nSo inferior to amohetamine IMO. Made me feel awful during AND after. Couldn\u2019t even concentrate on it well. No euphoria, only uncomfortable side effects and a jittery wired feeling.\n\nFlexeril - 3/10\nGood for muscle tension... makes me very sedated in a not so pleasant way. Some use to potentiate opiates but I think it made them feel dirtier. \n\nSoma - ?/10\nI took a lot with some Xanax one day and woke up 24 hours later with my ex gf super pissed at me so... not sure how much I enjoyed it!\n\nKava - 4/10\nWas fun when we finally found some that worked. Problem is the hangover and the nausea. Overall not really worth it IMO.\n\nNitrous oxide - 6/10\nGreat (9.5/10) in combination with dissociatives or psychedelics but pretty useless by themselves unless you are at the dentist. \n\nGabapentin - 8/10\nPossibility for strong euphoria if done correctly. Best thing is feeling like yourself but completely anxiety/stress free as opposed to other gabaergics. Downside is tolerance builds basically immediately. \n\nLyrica - 8/10\nLike Gabapentin but somewhat trippier. Also need a much lower dose than Gabapentin too. Gabapentin is much easier to function on though which is why I gave them both 8/10.\n\nPhenibut - 7.5/10\nThere is a couple hours in the middle of a Phenibut experience that feels like a 10/10, but that is usually preceded and followed by a lot of strange side effects. I used 3x a week for a month once and couldn\u2019t believe the withdrawals I had. Primal fear is a good description. Won\u2019t use more than once or twice a month now and haven\u2019t had an issue. Wish the duration wasn\u2019t so long. Great in combination with LSD though!\n\nGHB - 5/10\nSuper fun at the right dose. Reason for the somewhat low score is that the dose response curve is way too sensitive. Trust me that no one wants to see you G out!\n\nAmbien - 3/10\nLunesta - 3/10\nI can\u2019t even give these a good score for helping to sleep because it never made me fall asleep, only hallucinate. These hallucinations would be like people hanging from my fingers or sleds running around the room. Tried a few times and not interested in trying again.\n\nDiphenhydramine - 1/10\nOnly use this for allergies. Deleriants are just not my thing. Tried it once when I was young and felt awful. Nasty hallucinations.\n\nBenzos - 5/10\nXanax - 4/10\nValium - 5/10\nKlonopin - 6/10\nAtivan - 6/10\nDefinitely still has a use for comedowns, but that is all I would ever use it for now. Daily use I would rank at a 1 due to the loss of memory, idiotic behavior, and horrifying withdrawals including but not limited to seizures and constant panic. All benzos feel pretty similar and really only the duration and level of sedation differs IMO.\n\nNicotine - 6/10\nI quit smoking cigarettes but still vape. I\u2019d like to think I hate it but in reality I quite enjoy it... especially with other substances.\n\nOpiates - 8/10\nHydrocodone - 7/10\nOxycodone - 8/10\nMorphine - 7/10\nPoppy Tea - 8/10\nCodeine - 7/10\nHeroin - 9/10\nAll of these feel pretty similar and I\u2019m only separating those that feel much different. Opiates if used responsibly have given me some of the most fun dates and most euphoric experiences. When abused I would give them a 1/10 due to the hellish withdrawals and severe lack of motivation. Poppy Tea has probably the WORST withdrawals since it last for hours and hours on just one dose. Poppy tea is the only one I almost OD\u2019d on consistently. Daily use of any basically just makes you into a dick. The high rating was more so before dependence and now I wouldn\u2019t go back.\n\nTramadol - 5/10\nI\u2019ve had some experience that I would rank higher (9/10), but I\u2019ve also had some very uncomfortable ones I\u2019d rank at a 2/10. Only euphoric in higher doses but that's when your seizure threshold lowers. Gave me a seizure after quitting Xanax from only one week of daily use. Can be good but too dangerous overall even compared to other opiates/opioids.\n\nTianeptine - 2/10\nWas good one time then the next made me feel super strange from the antidepressant effects. Not worth it and I hear withdrawals are terrible. Super short duration and barely feels like a traditional opiate.\n\nSuboxone - 4/10\nHelped me stay off opiates before I learned Kratom was a better alternative. Was sometimes good and can make you nod but rarely euphoric. With no tolerance you will most likely be sick. Withdrawals from suboxone are up there with Xanax.

After going through opiate addiction it\u2019s not the same. It induced anxiety for the longest time until recently. Now I use every day and it\u2019s nice but not on par with most of the drugs on this list. I do like that there is no physical dependency and no side effects. Definitely the safest drug on this list. \r\n\r\nOxycodone(8/10): I haven\u2019t used this one after developing opiate tolerance but it was nice and potent. I don\u2019t think it would do much for me nowadays. Also very expensive.\r\n\r\nCodeine(2/10): quite trash with any sliver of opiate tolerance. I tried taking 200mg recently and all it did was make my scalp extremely itchy and uncomfortable. I\u2019ve been dependent on Kratom for about two years though so I definitely have a tolerance. Kratom has much more effect.\r\n\r\nEtizolam(10/10 therapeutic 1/10 recreational): a phenomenal tool to have for anxiety, comedowns, bad trips etc. Not recreational in the slightest though. Higher doses just make me feel dull, depressed and disconnected.\r\n\r\nHydrocodone(5/10): with tolerance it takes A LOT and not cost effective at all. I prefer Kratom\r\n\r\nAmphetamine(4/10): Has me feeling good and motivated for about an hour, then I just become extremely irritable.\r\n\r\n4-fa(6/10): quite euphoric but not close to being on par with MDMA. Short acting though. Makes me quite irritable while also feeling good.\r\n\r\n2-fma(5/10): more useful than Amphetamine as a functional stim IMO. Smoother comeup/comedown and not much effect on mood.\r\n\r\n2cb(8/10): Very easy psychedelic. Great for beginners. Hardly any headspace and nice eye candy.\r\n\r\nMDMA(10/10): Pure unadulterated love on tap. High therapeutic and recreational value. Definitely an all time favorite. Any sort of \u2018frequent\u2019 use will fuck your state of being up majorly.\r\n\r\nMXE(9/10): Very high therapeutic and recreational value. Really wish I could\u2019ve experimented more with this one. Better than ketamine for sure. It has more depth to it.\r\n\r\nAlcohol(8/10): as an anxious person this is a great one to open me up although the hangovers are a nightmare. Very socially acceptable though, almost too much so.\r\n\r\nComputer Duster(1/10): it\u2019s basically dumpster nitrous. Extremely dirty \u2018wubwubwub\u2019 effect. I can feel the brain cells dying.\r\n\r\nDXM(7/10): this shit was magic when I was a teenager. Quite dirty though. I had an amazing experience on 300mg dxm and 30mg hydrocodone. It is quite unique compared to other dissos. I used this one very frequently for a period of time. It has very nice after glow but definitely causes some brain-fog. Don\u2019t have much desire to use again. I have fond memories of binging trailer park boys and hell on wheels on 300mg doses though. Also the song Dramamine by Modest mouse was my anthem at the time. That song sounded amazing on DXM. \r\n\r\nPropylhexedrine(4/10): dirty stim buzz with a ton of vasoconstriction. If you get it out of the inhalers then my god they taste HORRIFIC. It does have a bit of euphoria though and definitely has the potential to trigger a 6 hour masturbation session.\r\n\r\nClonazepam(6/10): my favorite benzodiazapine. Has a bit more of a livened mood than Etizolam/Xanax. Still sort of a low recreational value though.\r\n\r\n25c-NBOMe(2/10): took this one before I knew what psychedelics really did. No euphoria, just sort of a headfuck and very minimal visuals. The vasoconstriction was pretty bad. At one point I was afraid my dick was going to fall off.\r\n\r\nNitrous(6/10): if only it lasted longer. Quite expensive for a binge but it\u2019s definitely nice and pairs well with pretty much everything.\r\n\r\nBuspirone(1/10): terrible terrible terrible. Just a dirty anxiolytic. Benzos are much better. DON\u2019T INSUFFLATE THIS. It gave me nasty brain zaps. I was a stupid 16 year old.\r\n\r\nAmbien(2/10): sort of like a more wonky benzo. Not very recreational imo. \r\n\r\nSynthetic Cannabinoids(5/10): I\u2019m not sure the exact compounds. I used a blend back around 2015. I enjoyed it but it was pretty dirty. I never got the intense hallucinogenic effects that some describe. It was very similar to cannabis.\r\n\r\nPhenibut(9/10): Very nice mood booster, anxiety reducer and social lubricant. Also pair well with most everything. Super prone to dependency though and has quite a comedown for me even at low doses. I can count on being pretty depressed on the 2nd day after dosing.\r\n\r\nAlprazolam: about the same as Etizolam\r\n\r\nDMT: this one frightens me and I doesn\u2019t have much of a draw towards recreational use at all. This is strictly a tool imo.\r\n\r\nHeroin(10/10): Beautiful but I definitely had a problem with this one. It\u2019s the perfect escape. Numb to everything. I swear my whole family could\u2019ve died and all it would take is a shot and everything is just fine. Addiction has intense negative social impact. I isolated and ignored my issues for about 2 years. It leads you into a stagnant haze.\r\n\r\nLSD(5/10): I\u2019d have to try this one again. I had a bad first experience in which I smoked way too much pot on the comeup and lost most of my ability to comprehend/communicate. This was not good as an already socially anxious person in a social setting. I would like to try again though as I am more comfortable nowadays.\r\n\r\nKratom(9/10): saved me from heroin addiction but Kratom dependency is also a pain in the ass. I dose every 4 hours and interdose anxiety/depression is terrible. My mood is pretty much completely dependent on whether not I have dosed recently. Great mood boost and pro-social effects though. Reduces anxiety and calms but can also Amp you up a bit depending on strain/setting.\r\n\r\n3-Meo-PCP(6/10?): this one is very hard for me to recall. I think I used only about 100mg of this in total spread across different days. I would like to try it again. I did feel a bit of mania which I liked.\r\n\r\nFuranylFentanyl(4/10): the fentalogues have potent opiod effect but very low euphoria IME. Also very short acting. I couldn\u2019t imagine being dependent on them. Seems like a nightmare\r\n\r\nButyrFentanyl(4/10): same as FuranylFentanyl.\r\n\r\nU47700(6/10): more euphoric by quite a bit but also extremely short acting. Also very caustic.\r\n\r\nBuprenorphan(3/10): Good tool for addicts but hardly any recreational value. Takes away most of the physical withdrawals but I still have major cravings. Kratom does a much better job of keeping me clean.\r\n\r\nMethamphetamine(5/10): Used this one for quite a bit. I was mainly drawn to the pipe. Once I realized this was the case I smashed mine and never bought another. I had no issue quitting after that. If you can stick to oral dosing though it\u2019s basically Adderall on steroids. Much longer lasting and smoother come down. I never really experienced the intense euphoria people describe. Just got twacked and paranoid on many occasions.\r\n\r\nTianeptine(3/10): this shit is the devil. Do NOT IV. This is the crack of opiates. Pretty intense rush but less than 30 minutes later and you're mixing another shot. My tolerance rose 3x fold in one day. I used 500mg the first day then 1.5g the next before my 2g was gone. Never bought more because I realized just how dangerous this one could be. I believe this is literally this worst thing you could be dependent on. I hear it also destroys your opiate tolerance to the point where even methadone and fentanyl doesn\u2019t put a dent in WD. It's also extremely caustic and I highly regret putting this in my veins.\r\n\r\nButane(2/10): dirty nitrous like buzz\r\n\r\n2-Methyl-2-Butanol(2/10): extremely dirty benzo-like buzz. Purchased as a potential alcohol replacement while drug/alcohol testing. Tasted absolutely horrible and had some weird side effects such as frequent urination at night and sore/enlarged nipples. Here\u2019s is an in depth post on my experience: https://www.reddit.com/r/drugs/comments/amodap\r\n\r\n1,4-Butanediol(7/10): Very euphoric and has INSANE aphrodisiac properties. It\u2019s very recreational but frequent use lead to my first ever panic attack and fucked up my anxiety for months after. Do not use this one frequently. After a 3 day binge I was paranoid and extremely anxious. This one seems to induce benzo WD like symptoms after a very short period of use. Also fucked up my sleep majorly.\r\n\r\nTramadol(2/10): doesn\u2019t do much at all for opioid tolerant people\r\n\r\nGabapentin(8/10): this is a great tool. I used it mainly for easing heroin WD. The first time I used it in this manner it was a God send. I slept like a baby and felt no WD at all. The second time I had an emotional break down in which I came to the realization of what I was doing to myself with heroin. I had just started IV\u2019ing a week or two prior. I broke down on the floor crying. I was an emotional wreck. This seems to have sort of a psychedelic quality imo. I could see it being quite recreational when not going through WD.\r\n\r\nMethadone(8/10): pretty much pharma heroin. Less euphoria though. If you\u2019re actually trying to escape the life of opiate addiction I think suboxone is much better. Methadone still gets you high af. It\u2019s a full opioid agonist just like heroin and scratches the same itch. The main difference is it gets you away from the needle and you don\u2019t have to worry about where your next fix is coming from. \r\n\r\nKetamine(9/10): I love this one. Quite recreational with no physical dependency potential. Great positive effects on anxiety and depression. I find it hard to describe but it\u2019s sort of like a serene, disconnected alcohol like buzz. Very calming. I have yet to experience the 'hole'.\r\n\r\nKava(6/10): nice alcohol replacement. Has a sort of stoning quality to it. No hangover or WD. Eases anxiety and lifts mood quite nicely.\r\n\r\n4-aco-met(10/10): my favorite psychedelic. Nice euphoria. MDMA-like entactogenic effects. Eye candy visuals and hardly any mind fuck although my highest dose was only 15mg. Buddy took 20mg though and LOVED IT.\r\n\r\n2-fdck(8/10): Very very similar to ketamine but it lacks something.", "author": "Exa8yte", "score": 258, "flair": "Long Post", "created": 1596617066.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/i3viw4/44_drugs_ive_used_and_my_reviews_on_them/", "num_comments": 74, "title": "44 drugs I've used and my reviews on them", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"g0eakqg": {"score": 101, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/i3viw4/44_drugs_ive_used_and_my_reviews_on_them/g0eakqg/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1596618098.0, "body": "All this drugs and no psilocybin?", "replies": {"g0ec2f4": {"score": 37, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/i3viw4/44_drugs_ive_used_and_my_reviews_on_them/g0ec2f4/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1596618984.0, "body": "Yeah, I guess for the longest time RC tryptamines were easier to get and also far cheaper.

Soon you'll be able to write a novel lol.  But srsly, this is a pretty solid subjective general description of the drugs you've tried and I can find a lot of the experiences very relatable.  Otherwise, stay strong in this period of opioid addiction you're going through.  It's a good thing you didn't delve deeper into the tianeptine/fent experience.  That stuff is truly scary in regards to it's addictive and dependence forming potential.  I agree that fent is oddly non-euphoric, although still more sedating than most opes in the classic opioid fashion.  Some people however strongly disagree and get hooked, and when it comes time to quit, it can be a hell like no other.  Good you dodged that bullet.  As for tianeptine, if they're leaving it legal, they really may as well make hydro, tramadol, codeine, etc legal.  I'm all for the decriminalization and potential legalization of drugs, but it's hard to deny that tianeptine in such an odd-ball with regards to it's legal status in a lot of places.  If you are currently working on getting off kratom, whether you try to taper or go balls to the wall cold turkey, good luck.  Kratom withdrawals can be a real clusterfuck.  Personally, I actually used bupe to taper off and had much more success with that.  It unfortunately really isn't the walk in the park it's frequently made out to be once you get to the high doses it sounds like your on.  Regardless, don't shy away from recovery if you get to the point that you decide you're done with life on opes.\n\nOne more thing I'd like to add is that propylhexedrine can be a really interesting drug if you decide to do an acid base extraction with it.  It's kinda at a disadvantage when comparing it to other drugs if you're just putting the cotton in OJ or something or just eating it straight because of just how fucking nasty it can be.  Propylhexedrine HCl when taken routes other than orally (NOT IV!!!  IV PROPYLHEXEDRINE CAN KILL) imo seems to be absorbed much better and come with much more pleasant effects.  When smoked, it's actually an interestingly chill stim high you wouldn't expect from propylhexedrine considering how adrenergic and intense it feels taken orally.  There's definitely a lot less vasoconstriction, and you need very little to go a long way.  It also really made me really wanna redose smoked.  I did bing it for a while which was a bad idea because the cardiac effects became increasingly apparent with each consecutive dose and it's pleasant effects became less and less apparent very quickly.  Smoked, it personally kinda feels like a mix of Ritalin and a little bit of dxm.  It's really a high of its own.", "replies": {"g8khnsw": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/i3viw4/44_drugs_ive_used_and_my_reviews_on_them/g8khnsw/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1602512012.0, "body": "The highest I've gone regarding Kratom use is ~20gpd. I'm down to 12 gpd now quite comfortably. Shouldn't be too terrible from there I hope? I would like to get some bupe just because it would be much easier to taper and you're not going through interdose withdrawals every four hours. That's what I hate most about Kratom. The duration is too short. I'm constantly looking at the clock to see how long it is until I can dose again.. We're you able to get your bupe from a clinic as just a Kratom user?

I subconsciously started dosing more frequently simply in response to interdose withdrawal symptoms (anxiety, racing thoughts, fatigue, yawning, nausea, sweats, and sniffles) and making a concrete dosing schedule to stick to each day was difficult.  I was able to get bupe from an addiction specialist even though I was just taking kratom.  I may have gotten lucky, but it seems like more and more specialists are becoming aware of kratom addiction.  They waited for me first to go into withdrawals and gave me clonidine before letting me have sub even though it seems that people don't generally require a induction period during the switch from kratom to bupe.  I was with my mom at the time, and when she called and discussed my symptoms, they gave me 4mg and told me to take two mg every two hours until I felt comfortable.  It sounds like you already have some experience with sub so you probably have a vague idea how to dose.  For example, I took 8, and frankly that was quite high. I also had a pretty large habit compared to what you got going on at this point.  You could probably get away with 2mg or so at this point (try 1-1.5mg first).  \n\nThe interdose withdrawal with sub tapering is definitely noticeable, but not nearly as intense or sudden ime, and that frankly made a big difference along with the fact that I really didn't need to schedule doses (just took one in the morning and one in the evening).  Overall I had some crankiness, fatigue, mild hot flashes, sniffles, yawns, stretching, tummy troubles, etc but it was generally very mild.  Even though I would say the physical withdrawals from sub are definitely less severe that physical withdrawals from other opes, I would say they can be overall a little bit more prominent than with kratom, but it was definitely less intense psychologically.  I actually got overall pretty sleepy while tapering, although at the start of my taper I unsurprisingly had some sleeping troubles.  Regardless of what you're tapering with, you can expect that.  With tapering sub, you gotta go slow because of how long it takes for sub to leave your system.  I did a 25-33% dose reduction every 3 weeks to a month, which was definitely enough time to recover.\n\nSorry these are so damn long.  Good luck man.  Worst case scenario, you can't find sub from any doctor in your area or you don't feel it helps that much with your taper.

That\u2019s a decent enough example as to just how desperate I was/am to not feel. I wanted all the hurt to leave me, and drugs did that, for a time. So I chased highs, all the highs I could find. I\u2019d spend all day hating and resenting the world and figuring out how to get high or drunk again. I tried the whole DPH/DXM, air duster, spice/K2, Kratom, LSA seeds, Salvia, Amanita, Nitrous, and poppers (pretty much all the legal jawns the head shop sold) I\u2019d pilfer my moms pills, some active, some not. Ambien, Lyrica, but ultimately it was various benzos and opioids that we\u2019re my favorite. I always hated school and although I was getting drunk as much as possible I didn\u2019t get into much trouble Freshman year, (5000 kids went to my HS so that helped), maybe got into a few fights or just being a drunk prick but never anything serious. Sophomore year is when it hit the fan, I got sent to Juvi for a month (I did juvi 3 times, but the 36 days locked down was the worst, the other two I could still go to school just had to go back to juvi at night), a little after that I got sent to a boys boarding school that turned out to be like a legitimate fraud so that only lasted about 3 months. But it fucked my GPA (.3-.4 that year, yet I still graduated on time, a miracle) After that I settled down into just drinking and doing pills, still at school sometimes but mostly at home. That\u2019s how HS went. I didn\u2019t have \u2018friends\u2019 I had people who also did drugs, but it was always a competition, I had to win. (I weigh 115lbs) so I never win a drinking contest but still try. (My favorite combo was Ambien, Adderall, Alcohol, Weed, and Percocet) My parents protested my use at first but after all of the rehabs and IOP they decided to just let me stay safe and get drunk at their house where they knew I wasn\u2019t driving/dying (which is beyond stupid, don\u2019t be those parents) a girl OD\u2019d on spice on our porch and the ambulance came and she said they were lighting her on fire, it was a shit show and this was all before I even turned 18. \n\n18 to 21: Turning 18 changed it all, My first Felony, my first OWI that honestly should have killed me and my gf and my best friend (totaled 3 cars at 55mph), no more juvi (3 times) now it was jail (6 times, for mostly drugs and an OWI). So much shit happened, it\u2019ll take a lifetime to recount it all. Just lots of insanity, lots of drugs. I had 7 different W2s for 2012. I moved out of my parents because obviously, then I moved in with a girlfriend and her parents and shit went so down hill. We did drugs, all of the drugs, MDMA and it\u2019s analogues, RC\u2019s, Ketamine, painkillers and benzos, nitrous, amphetamine, but ultimately, Heroin. I think I was 19. She was 3 years younger than me, so I\u2019ll let you do the math, it was all illegal and it\u2019s all so fucking insane, but it was always consensual, always. We loved each other but looking back, she was too young to be doing what we were doing. She was 15 when she started doing everything I was doing, don\u2019t be that role model for someone, even if we did it together and rolled face or tripped balls and \u2018feel so deeply in love\u2019 it wasn\u2019t the right time. I was consistently getting arrested and going to rehab, it was hell for her. I used her to sell drugs (she\u2019d flirt a little with the dudes, raise the price, and that\u2019s how we did it) she was good at it and she loved holding the money. We had a lot of fun at shows and festivals, eating all of the club drugs. Smoking opium in a hammock at EF \u201813 then getting lost in the forest on K that night. We had the best of times. Until it wasn\u2019t. The heroin ruined it so quickly, I became a lunatic. I was soooo vindictive and hateful. I wanted the world to burn, my dark side came out a lot during our relationship. One night while on acid she cried in my arms and said \u2018Im just sad because one day you\u2019re going to kill me then kill yourself\u2019 Ok so it was bad. \n\n21 to 23: This was a lot of white knuckling it and pulling \u2018geographic\u2019 rehab attempts, I did rehabs and moved states, found a plug when I moved and relapsed a few times, never for long. I\u2019d been sober and done enough AA to have ruined my using, it wasn\u2019t fun, it was killing me and I had to stop.\n\n24 to Now: I finally had enough and I got sober for the longest stint yet, ever since I started doing drugs at 14 I hadn\u2019t gotten nearly as long as I did this last big try. Everything was perfect, my mind felt right. Everything that could be better, was. I\u2019d been diagnosed with everything (depressions, anxiety, bi polar, sociopathic, blah blah) but when sober, nothing like that. It was the most pure and real bliss I\u2019ve ever experienced. Being sober is the key to ultimate self realizations and understanding the universe and I\u2019m positive of that. Drugs may \u2018show you the path\u2019 but sobriety gets you there, guaranteed. I had a relapse after that and it was hard, I got on Suboxone thinking that would help, (it was the worst mistake I could have made) but it\u2019s been 3 years. I\u2019m ready to get off but it\u2019s been truly difficult, so here\u2019s how I\u2019m doing it and it\u2019s not \u2018perfect\u2019 but it\u2019s fucking working.\n\nTL; DR\n\nMethod, ~2mg Suboxone for 3 years*\n-Tapered onto heroin for a week then went cold turkey \n\nDaily Routine \n-a.m. Clonidine .1g as needed, Cannabis as needed, 1mg Alprazolam, 15g Red Vein Kratom, .05g Cubensis microdose with unknown Lions Mane amount \n-lunch 500mg Soma, 1mg Etizolam, Clonidine as needed, Cannabis as needed \n-p.m GHB 2g at least, Clonidine and Cannabis as needed, maybe alcohol\n-p.m. before bed, 1mg Alprazolam Cannabis and Clonidine \n\nAs soon as I got off the heroin my mu opioid receptors were going into \u2018panic\u2019 mode, the mu receptor withdrawal is the one responsible for all the nasty symptoms (the sickness) My plan, stay comfortable through that phase and then deal with the delta opioid receptors on week two.

With the epidemic now, me not having insurance, a job that was seasonal and my doctor who one day says you got 3 months to find someone else to prescribe your methadone,I'm quitting the practice because of health issues, I found myself at the end of those 3 months without a doc or my script. 4 days into methadone withdrawal I decided to try heroin, temporarily until I could find someone I could afford or until I'd saved enough to get into one of the PM docs that want your entire paycheck for your first appointment. Well temporarily went 5 months until I was locked up and got off heroin in jail. I still had pretty sever withdrawal symptoms( and I can only assume from the methadone) for another 3 months after that. No energy, extremely weak, hypertension( had a headache in the back of my head and neck for the entire 3 months and BP of around 180/110) blurred and jittery vision,and diarrhea,and barely slept more than 3 hrs per day.I had to deal with my legal issues within that time and spent most of it locked up,briefly out in between, if not for that I dont think I could have worked. I've gone thru major withdrawals only twice in my 20 years of opiates,the first was for about 6 days and I never felt any better till I had more pills of course, and this past time, where I wasn't at 100% and made the mistake of KRATOM! Yes for those who preach the kratom, I for one dont think it would help one bit for suboxone withdrawals,I have chipped from time to time and I'm the type if I have a couple days use I'll have withdrawals for a couple of days after, and kratom barely helped for a 2 day dope bender. And I also feel kratom is just another fucking thing that I now have to have or suffer the consequences. I'm clean from pills and dope, but yet addicted to another substance that is praised just because it's legal? And yes I know it doesn't nearly do the damage that opiates do or cause the behaviors, but its still something that is controlling my life because I cannot go without it. Anyway, sorry about that. Irks me a little seeing kratom so highly praised,it helps with pain a little other than that I cannot stand it. Back to withdrawals, that's the 2 times I've had to go thru it, is suboxone easier than methadone perhaps? Anyway, I wish you the very best! It's one thing to kick it, it's another to stay off it, and that a year and a half later,I'm still struggling with. It is tough without a medicated aid, especially when pain is involved.

I had a backup supply because doc wrote for 16 and I only took 2. So I\u2019d try to go cold turkey and fail again and again, but every time I got back on, 2mg or less, then eventually I just started trying to take even less than that, I bought a milligram scale (0.000) on Amazon just so I could accurately weigh out less than 1/4 pill, and after maybe a month of consistently being at 1mg/day I got the 2mg pills and cut those into 1/4s so I could dose between .5 and .25mg a day, and I did that for a week. Then I stopped taking them entirely and shot BTH for I think like 7-9 days (only had 1.3g) and I wasn\u2019t shy about doing fat shots to nod, I thought I kinda deserved it. After the tar was gone there was a rough couple days, on the second day I mentally lost it, lost all hope for life, I wanted to die. But the literal pharmaceutical treasure trove got me through that, (mainly Xanax and Clonidine) I used to rag on clonidine being ineffective but when I\u2019m able to take as much as I want (as opposed to being doled our 1 at a time in rehab) it really helps, I take two if it\u2019s bad, and then 1mg Xanax and get BLAZED until I\u2019m not thinking about it anymore.

We smoked it and as luck would have it I had an appoint a few days later. As more luck would have it he did another urine screen. You know how that turned out. One stupid freaking mistake and he cut me off. Gave me one more month fill and cut me off. WD is the most horrible thing I have ever experienced. Luckily I found kratom. It really helps. I should mention my neurologist prescribed 4200 mgs of gabapentin a day. I think kratom made the difference. Really does help me with the WD symptoms.

There were times when I went to get methadone over the years, but mostly to get something when things dried up, and was not taking it when I finally quit. The three I mentioned were the main offenders, but towards the end I was moving toward taking RCs (A-pvp, A-php, 4f-php mostly) and meth pretty regularly (luckily that didn\u2019t last more than a year or two). I took everything else under the sun when I could get it too, but wasn\u2019t addicted to others. I was damn near convinced I needed benz and ops, and had a doctor who was willing to exploit that for years (plugs were too of course). Long story short the doctor dropped me as a patient when she started getting scrutinized, and around the same time I moved two states away from my plugs. With what little bit of Valium I managed to get before leaving and a non-refillable script for fentanyl patches, I weened off by microdosing myself. Except tobacco. I was smoking American Spirit rollies but replaced them with a vape, then quit vape for filtered cigs, then straight up quit after a pack of 100 nicorette gum. No vape or anything anymore. Almost a full year ago and I\u2019m still coughing up shit..\n\nStill smoke weed and occasionally small doses of mushies, but it\u2019s not a problem for me. It actually played a huge role in helping not go back after. I didn\u2019t smoke so much during weening bc every little thing already sent me into a panic attack. \n\nSorry for length, just had to get that out. My wife is proud of me, but no one else in my family really knows the extent of my substance abuse. I didn\u2019t want to jump the gun and brag before I knew I wasn\u2019t gonna relapse, but life is coming back to me now and now I\u2019m coming back to life.\n\nTL;DR: I was fucked up 24-7 for 10 years.

Ever since age 13-15 I never felt normal. I was always anxious and never seemed as content as others around me. At 15, a couple magical things entered my life - Marijuana and alcohol. I would take a couple bong rips of weed and feel happy again! I would drink alcohol and become a social butterfly, managed to get my first kisses w girls, and felt more content than ever. I found the cure to depression! I just didn't realize it was similar to how Sigmund Freud found the cure in cocaine...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started attending parties with some other kids who liked to experiment with alcohol and found a little niche in my highschool of stoners, partiers, and psychedelic heads. This lead to me trying mushrooms and acid which I loved, and to this day still have fond memories of. That being said, don't take anything like that unless you really research it and there is no history of schizophrenia in your family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was a bright kid and always managed 90s without studying but I started cutting class to go smoke weed and drink, then I'd show up high halfway through the day. This didn't interfere too much as I still graduated with a 85 average but it would be a theme throughout college...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I was leaving for college I decided what kind of guy goes to college a virgin so I started talking to the most promiscuous girl at my school. I took her to a drive-in, we drank, and we had sex. Probably would have been better had I not drank myself into oblivion before because I was so nervous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom there, I went to one of the top party schools in the US for reasons you can probably imagine. It was real easy to get into the clubs underage and the house party scene was incredible. I drank almost daily and it was starting to take a toll on my body. I was always hungover, skipping class, and didn't have a social life besides night life. Then I was hit with a .6 GPA. Scared the shit out of me. Scare me enough to stop partying though? Never!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMolly came into the room, then cocaine, then a heavy adderall coke problem...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started sleeping until 4PM, occasionally attending class, then popped 100 MG of adderall and studied all night. Managed to pull a 2.6GPA that semester but everything else was declining. My mental health was in the toilet, I was suicidal, and my friendships were deteriorating. Yet I never blamed drugs or alcohol. They were the cure! I needed them because I felt so shitty inside!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy alcohol use turned from extroversion to introversion. I stopped going out to drink in my dorm room by myself or with my roommate. What was strange during this period is I would trip every couple weeks and I'd always have an epiphany of how badly I was fucking up myself and my life, and I vowed to change and to fulfill my potential, then someone would ask me to drink with them and I was off to the races. It was around this time my best friend introduced me to something called Opana...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I thought alcohol and other drugs were the cure, I was mistaken. THIS was the cure! I didn't act like an drunken idiot, I didn't still have that lingering feeling that I was doing wrong. All neurotic emotions were wiped away, anxiety, depression, all gone. I felt free! I was good at talking to women, something I struggled with, I asked questions in class without fear of judgment, everything was better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, I couldn't get my hands on the drug. It was hard to find, so I had to wait for my friend to offer me some. This went on from 19-21, with me occasionally doing good in school, then failing, then doing well again. Around 21 I met my now girlfriend and her friends. They were xan heads and it was just another drug that entered into the picture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nXans were great at first. Anxiety was wiped and when I combined it with opiates I never felt better. This quickly turned into me feeling like a miserable zombie when the honeymoon period was over and I hated it. I quit cold turkey and the withdrawals were some of the worst I've ever gone through, not to mention incredibly dangerous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy relationship with my girlfriend really took off then. And good news! I didn't have to rely on my friend for Opana because now we had a heroin connect. So all we did was work all day, and get high all night. I would eat and immediately puke from the heroin, but I didn't care. Life was good\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen we burnt through her savings and didn't have money for more and something weird happened. I felt like shit. I felt like I had the flu and couldn't get comfortable in my own skin, like I HAD to keep thrashing around in bed. I quickly learned this is opiate withdrawal and it is the WORST experience I've ever had. For the worst experience of all time though, I went through it probably 200 times. Maybe more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis all spiraled completely out of control and I found myself in my first rehab. Wasn't the best rehab and I didn't get much out of except don't touch heroin again. They put me on suboxone, a partial opiate that blocks your receptors as well so you get a little high but don't get high off strong opiates like heroin. And I just started eating that like candy...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay I got out of rehab I started drinking again because alcohol wasn't the problem, it was opiates! Long story short, I become a suboxone addicted alcoholic which after 2 years leads me back into heroin use. I got my car stolen when I traded hours of its use for 100$ of heroin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis was the lowest point in my life and I came clean to my parents that my problem was back, although they already knew I was an alcoholic. This time though, I went to a very very good rehab. I was done, ready to quit. For the first 22 days of my 30 day stay, I did heavy introspection. Why was I so fucking unhappy? WHY did I use? What was my problem?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd after day 22 I pieced together a solid theory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst came my issues. Unresolved emotional trauma (and it doesn't have to be BIG trauma, just something you never resolved) led to me being pulled in ways I had never considered. I was always horrible with eye contact, had a general sense of shame, and didn't like socializing sober. I identified an event in my childhood that this came from and once I understood how the unresolved feelings led to this, I could finally stop it! I closely watched myself as I interacted with others. Watched my feelings and any time I was exhibiting these nervous behaviors, I told myself, \"You're acting like this while interacting with people because you don't want them to see this event that happened to you as a child. It isn't real. It's in the past\" and slowly I got better. I realized the invisible string that was pulling me and I cut it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI thought I had free will but as long as you have these issues pulling and controlling you, you are about as free as a rat who smells cheese.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother example of an issue was unresolved anger towards my father. I would often dream of fighting him and this feeling led an overall hatred of authority, be it teachers, police, etc..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI talked to him about this and we got some therapy and what happened? The dreams disappeared and now I don't have a problem with authority.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI realized I used drugs to run from my unresolved emotional issues. I never felt content, I was always running. I had to be COURAGEOUS and face these feelings head on. And something weird happened. When I actually showed up to the fight, these feelings slowly went away. It was like running from a dog, they will always catch you and fuck you up. If you face that dog with strong body language, they hesitate, and even run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was raised Roman Catholic and about the age of 13, I turned my back on all of it. I thought people who believed in god were stupid and ignorant. This kind of changed at age 17 when I was eating a lot of mushrooms. I got into buddhism in college and my spiritual growth began. It was always hindered by my drug and alcohol use until that second rehab. I began meditating and praying regularly, and not the prayer when you ask for things. I just gave thanks for things when I prayed. I was grateful for my working, relatively athletic body, my family, my friends, the hot shower, anything. I was even beginning to be thankful for my anxiety and the courage I was given to face it. It was like anything in life. A challenge that had to be overcome. Gratitude kills misery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't care if you believe in god. But you must admit this life is crazy, and if you believe there is only the physical, I hope you rethink that and keep an open mind. I NEVER EVER THOUGHT I would come back to spiritual beliefs. I was a close minded know it all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't like using the word god because of the negative connotations. Energy, the universe, consciousness, etc all mean the same thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm back in school now and I actually have ambition now. I'm getting my degree in psychology and philosophy and am going to be a therapist. I figure if I've overcome depression and anxiety myself, I'm more qualified than a lot of people out there to try and help others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReally reflect on the issues part of this. Think if there is anything that happened to you that could be influencing your mind, body, and spirit today. You need to cut those strings, and a good therapist could help you identify them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI NEVER thought I'd be happy. I really gave up. I knew I would die early and miserable. I just happened to stumble into getting better through a heroin problem, ironic. I HAD to hit those lows to get better, but YOU don't. It IS possible to get better. I promise you. Please don't give up!

I'm 23 now, and can go through 200mg oxy in a night, even while mixing it with xanax. \n\nAfter my last oxy binge, I spent $300-$400 of my savings in a week. I even did something I never thought I would do before. I went to a pawn shop to sell my $300 14k gold chain, given to me by my dad shortly after my mom passed away earlier this year. They offered me $160, I asked for $200, and they accepted the offer.. but after a last minute change in heart, I walked out of the pawn shop with the neckless.\n\nA day or two later, I took 250mg of strong oil distilled edibles after a 2 month tolerance break, and needless to say, I did not have a good time no matter how many benzos I tried to take and calm me down. I ended up looking up my deceased mother's facebook, and did something I cant usually do. I cried, I was sobbing for the first time since her death. The edibles helped me feel some emotion at least. I did not realize how long I was suppressing those emotions for.\n\nThe next day, I made an appointment with a suboxone clinic. I went there today at 5:30 A.M. and was there for a good 3 hours, but after walking out, I felt different. Since my opiate use started at 15, I've been using for 8 years as I am now 23. I have never considered going to detox, or rehab, but this deal where I go to the clinic to get my daily dose every day seemed doable, and I am blessed to be approved for recovery grants. Without those grants, I would be paying over $100 a week.\n\nThe fact I have such a great, free opportunity to finally stop relapsing on opiates, I finally feel this is the first step to stabilizing my mind and life. They drug test for other drugs as well, so it will keep me in check and I will go everyday to take suboxone because it blocks those horrible cravings, and it blocks the euphoric effects of these horrible opiates if I were to consider slipping up, making it a waste of money and not worth even doing.\n\nI was not clean when my mom died and she always wanted me to be clean.

I know too many people who ruined their lives from this addiction, including my highschool sweetheart, my older sister, and my father.\n\nAnd if you are already down the rabbit hole, dont be afraid to try suboxone. It's a partial opiates antagonist, but the feeling is subtle enough to help you not use, and it will make using any other opiates a waste.\n\nI am getting clean for myself, but I am also doing it because it is what my mom wanted for me. It's the only thing I can do for her now that she is gone. \n\nPlease call your mom people. She is the only person I want to talk to right now.. since I can't, I figured I would tell you guys.

The only thing I want to warn you about is that even though Suboxone (and Methadone which is what I'm on) help you to stop using and eases the cravings for opiates, it still isn't a quick fix for your life. You still need to confront all the reasons why you were using in the first place. I got on methadone in 2016 and got clean pretty much right away and stayed clean from EVERYTHING and I thought \"this is it, I'm finally gonna be normal, healthy, happy and successful\" but that couldn't have been further from the truth. I relapsed several times since then not only on heroin but on other drugs as well and developed other habits when I wasn't using heroin to drugs like Klonopin and coke. Why? Because I still needed a way to cope and that's the only way I knew how. I've been abusing drugs since I was 12 and have always engaged in self destructive behaviors to cope with my emotions and mental illnesses. If I wasn't self harming (cutting) then I was active in my eating disorder and if not that then I was using drugs.  So I've finally realized it isn't just the drug use I have to change - it's also my mindset, my habits, my coping skills, the way I think, etc. And it's damn fucking difficult but worth it because I know I'll never be free or happy until I confront everything I've been running and hiding from.\n\nOh and one more thing - the reminder to not forget about your mom and to appreciate her is sweet and all and I know it was said with good intentions, but just remember that not everyone's mother is a good mother or a real mother at all.

You're taking exactly the right approach, which is first stabilization, then addressing some of the more deep-rooted issues that might be going on (the intense degree of comorbidity between addiction and other mental illness is not particularly surprising IMO.)  I really feel for your struggles, because they mirror my own to a significant extent.  The physical and emotional abuse and the long-term opioid addiction are the same things I struggled with (and continue to, in the form of depression and anxiety)  - and like you I managed to get clean through bupe, though without the benefit of any medical supervision, haha. \n\n Ironically enough, I had to start taking bupe again over the past two years due to a severe knee injury and multiple surgeries that resulted in some really annoying chronic pain - it was interesting trying to convince my doctors to only give me bupe in general as I just didn't trust myself with oxy or some other strong opiate (and still winding up throwing out quite a bit of oxy while my willpower still held.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, once you feel ready and have at least somewhat addressed any inner demons, particularly the grief you feel, only then should you start a slow taper.  Your emotions will come back much much stronger than likely ever before given when you began your opioid use, so keeping things on an even keel and pausing the taper as necessary is absolutely key to preventing relapse.  It might take a few months, but more likely a year or two to get to the point where you can jump off.  Bupe is a whole different animal than almost any other opioid in human use, while it can be abused, that's generally something only mostly opioid-naive people can enjoy anyway.  More importantly, it'll help prevent you from feeling anything from oxy when (not if) you have a moment of weakness and essentially attempt a relapse.  The strong anti-depressant effects of bupe due to its unique kappa-opioid receptor antagonism will also help significantly.  The other commenter was right in one thing though, suddenly having to stop mid-taper will lead to somewhat \\[relative to oxy\\] less severe withdrawal symptoms, but they will drag on for weeks and weeks.  I personally rather endure plain old oxy or heroin withdrawal than the endless dysphoria of bupe WD. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWish you all the best, considering our similar experiences (though I didn't suffer a devastating loss in the family, but rather the accidental death of a close friend.

Exercise and diet too.\n\nI guess it's hating on my own shadow, kinda how they say you can't bullshit a bullshitter? I remember having my klonopin script, and goddamn sure I was eating em like candy at least some of the time. You don't become a drug addict then take controlled substances as prescribed, that just isn't a thing. You might make sure you don't really run out, but you're gonna have fun with them. I got fucked up off my klonopin, or convinced people I \"needed\" this or that substance... No one wants to be judged for the fact that they're getting high. Hell, two months ago you made a post about how you abuse your adderall. \n\nAs someone who's went thru a few rehabs, and is on their second stint of recovery, surrounded by people who pulled themselves out of SERIOUS fucking drug habits (not OMG I SPENT $400 in a week, try I slang an oz of ketamine a day and still came up short half the time cause I partied so hard), it's just insulting to make this out like some crazy success story. \"I went to the doctor and got subs, and I also swindled him into giving me a kpin and addy script so now I don't need to go to a drug dealer, and because of the drug tests I don't really take anything else now\" is NOT some fucking success story... It's just regular old junkie manipulation. Being on benzos, opiates, and amphetamines is so far from sober, you have to be seriously fucking spun out to think that's anywhere near recovery. It's fucking insulting to people who actually KICK the habit and get clean. In this day and age, where vivitrol is a thing, where you can literally be fucking chemically castrated from being able to do opiates, you're obviously just on subxone because you still wanna be high. \n\nThe irony of calling me a troll? Being prescribed uppers, downers, screamers and laughers and then saying you're clean is the most troll shit I've heard all month. You got a fucking pharmaceutical arsenal up in there for fucks sake!", "replies": {}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}, "eh2nn9": {"text": "I\u2019m a very experienced Ketamine user, twice a month for the last two years.

At age 12 I found a bottle of vicodin in my parents cabinet. I was hooked from right then and there. By 13, at the end of my freshman year of high school, I was a full blown addict with opiates. By 14, I discovered adderall and tramadol. This was my sophomore year. Every day before school started I'd take roughly 12-15 10mg hydros, two 20mg addys when I got to school and roughly 400mg of tramadol before 2nd period. Halfway through, I graduated to fentanyl and oxycontin in place of my hydrocodone/vicodin. No less than 160mg of oxys or roxis, and if I could find fentanyl I'd usually get the sucker things or just suck the gel out of the patches. This continued, every day, throughout my entire time in high school, an addict to multiple substances. \n     By 15 I shot up heroin for the first time, it was lovely, but for whatever reason I never got into it heavily. By the time I was 18, I've done everything there was to do. But for many years, opiates were my true love. By 22, I was using no less than 200mg of oxy/roxi per day, with the occasional 80mg of adderall here and there to feel extra sweet. By 24, I discovered my love for benzos. Mind you, I was still using opiates heavily and by this time I was also using heavy doses of Xanax and K-pins. When I say heavy, I mean 8-10 bars in one handful. Somehow, I was lucky to never have OD'd all but one time but I was wittingly courting death as I was convinced nothing could kill me. January of this year I decided to try a suboxone program for my opiate use, 24mg a day and it worked alright for me. But I couldn't stop the zans, and picked up a meth binging habit. \n     Fast forward to the end of April, I beat up my step dad for no reason during a black out. I went to jail, blacked out, bailed myself out, blacked out, walked home, still blacked out, fought my step dad again, ate the remaining 9 bars I had (according to my mom) and tried fighting the police when they came to take me back to jail. Fast forward to now. I'm 26, just celebrated my first birthday sober since I was 11yrs old. I'm facing 9 months in prison, thankfully because of covid I was only locked up for just shy of a month. I nearly died in jail from the benzo withdrawal. It was horrible. When I got bailed out at the end of May, it took no less than an hour for me to accept that it's time to change. I signed myself in to a PHP program which lasted until the middle of June, graduated and am now doing IOP. Which I'm on track to graduate from next week, on the mark of two months sober for me. The longest stint of sobriety in my whole life.\n     I don't know why I decided to write this, and for the sake of time I've skipped some incredible details. But maybe it can inspire someone. Nothing about this is easy, but if you find a reason to live it makes it worth it. For me, that reason is my little sister and my girlfriend who I absolutely adore. She's a fucking Saint, and I'm blessed that she's been there for me during the last 4 months, the hardest 4 months, of my life. This community is great.

In the gif i use the plastic from a cereal box, but i don't like putting plastic in my mouth daily, so these days i use parchment paper.\n\n01.  Cut the strip to your dose size.\n\n02.  Cut the parchment paper slightly larger than the dose\n\n03.  Lightly lick the NON printed side of the sub strip, the opposite side to the N8. Make sure to use as little saliva as possible so the dose doesn't start to melt!\n\n04.  Center the dose on the parchment paper, and stick it down like a stamp. If using wax paper stick it to the non wax side. \n\n05.  Trim the parchment paper if needed\n\n06.  Dry off the portion of your cheek/lip you are going to put the dose. Dryer makes it stick better but too dry +cottonmouth wont give you any absorption \\[shameful absorption, slime princess\\] \n\n07.  Stick the dose onto the dry spot and get on with your day!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this helps someone, i know it helped me when i was tapering and cutting smaller pieces, but for real, it can maximize the amount of meds you get from each strip and save ca$h plus up your emergency stash. thanks for putting together such a great community yall. \n\nhere is a gif i made: https://media.giphy.com/media/WnUREi3ZA6hvNiQwW5/giphy.gif", "author": "alliknowaboutdrugs", "score": 15, "flair": "Suboxone", "created": 1583478657.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/fe3zqe/get_every_last_mg_out_of_suboxone_film_easyfree/", "num_comments": 31, "title": "Get every last mg out of Suboxone film - easy/free buccal translation for sub strips", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fjn0agb": {"score": 4, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/fe3zqe/get_every_last_mg_out_of_suboxone_film_easyfree/fjn0agb/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1583521622.0, "body": "Doctors hate him for this one simple TRICK! \nClick here to find out now", "replies": {"fjngtfb": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/fe3zqe/get_every_last_mg_out_of_suboxone_film_easyfree/fjngtfb/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1583535871.0, "body": "def felt like those keywords as i was typing... hehehe", "replies": {}}}}, "fjn1yx8": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/fe3zqe/get_every_last_mg_out_of_suboxone_film_easyfree/fjn1yx8/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1583523717.0, "body": "I know I waste a ton when my mouth too slimy or wet.

But, before that, I had one hell of a run. With no further ado, here are my Top Ten favorite drug combos of all time:\n\n1.) Adderall + Weed: I just love this combo. I'd usually take 20-60+ mg's of Addy, wait about an hour, then smoke some weed. You don't need much weed to get the synergistic effects of this combo. If there was a full on Drug buffet, Adderall and Weed would be my go-to picks.\n\n2.) Molly + Meth: Holy dopamine and serotonin depletion, Batman. But the first few hours are unlike anything I had ever experienced. I don't recommend doing this one. Great time, awful comedown/next day.\n\n3.) Soft + Hard Coke: Danger, Will Robinson. I'm pretty sure there's an increased risk of heart attack with this combo, but goddamn if it ain't great. When I used to do this, I'd alternate between doing rails and taking hits. Shit is amazing. And, as per usual, the better the soft & hard I had was, the better this combo was. I'd always make sure to have some weed on hand for the utterly brutal comedown off these two.\n\n4.) Lyrica + Cocaine: If you haven't tried Lyrica (aka pregabalin) I suggest trying it once. Shit is hard to describe, but it gives me a euphoric body buzz with a slightly psychedelic feeling. Mixing these two is highly habit forming. But holy shit is it awesome. Whether you choose hard or soft Coke really doesn't matter...they're both fuckin fantastic.\n\n5.) Molly + DMT: Wooo doggy. The best times I've had while mixing these two was when I boofed a cap with 400-500 mg's of good Molly, waited til I felt the Molly peak approaching, then smoked my DMT. Everything was so surreal and beautiful.\n\n6.) Cocaine + Weed: One of the classics. I'd always try to do the Coke first. Then when I was good 'n' geetered, I'd smoke a bowl/joint/blunt/dab. The combined feeling of these two is fucking awesome. 7/7 would recommend if you've never tried it.\n\n7.) Shrooms + Weed: I don't really like smoking weed when I'm tripping. Usually, I'll wait til my comedown to smoke. There's just something about cannabis flowers that amazes me when I'm Shroomin'. They're just so...beautimous. I typically stare at the nug I'm breaking up just admiring it's inherent beauty. \n\n8.) Molly + Lyrica: This combo is similar to Coke and Lyrica. Well, maybe not. I just associate them cuz I discovered both combos the same year. When doing this combo, I'd always take the Lyrica first, and wait til it's kicked in before I boofed my Molly capsule. Shit is bonkers. I used to make sure I had the next day free, as this combo tended to make me feel like dog shit afterwards.\n\n9.) Ativan + DMT: This combo is unlike the others in that I would take the Ativan (aka lorazepam) to calm my pre-DMT nerves. Even after smoking DMT hundreds of times, I still get anxious before smoking it. Which is the reason I tried this combo. And it works. 1 or 2 mg's of Ativan is all I would really need when I did this combo.\n\n10.) Benzedrex + Suboxone: This is kinda the bastard of the bunch. I don't recommend doing Benzedrex OR Suboxone. But, at least for me, these two are very synergistic. Idk why it feels that way, but this combo is on the list because I used to like it a lot. If you try this combo, take the Suboxone beforehand, then 20-30 minutes later take the Benzedrex. Make sure you are hydrated and have eaten a meal before taking these two together. Otherwise, you might end up puking.\n\n**I do not recommend mixing substances you're unfamiliar with. Practice Harm Reduction every time it's possible. Use a test kit to find out wtf it is you've got. Set & Setting can greatly improve your psychedelic experiences. Most of all, be good to yourself. After all, you only get one of you**\n\n*What are your all-time favorite drug combos?*", "author": "The-LSD-Sheet-Guy", "score": 18, "flair": "Long Post", "created": 1583643131.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ff1bws/my_top_ten_favorite_drug_combos/", "num_comments": 32, "title": "My Top Ten Favorite Drug Combos", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fjulwqq": {"score": 6, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/ff1bws/my_top_ten_favorite_drug_combos/fjulwqq/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1583646860.0, "body": "Meth and lyrica.

It's nice to hear from someone else whos gone through/going through the same type of shit. You're 100% right it's absolutely mental.

Then I found out he never really got clean, just got good at hiding it from me so I started using behind his back til we inevitably broke up.\n\nSecond time, I got pneumonia went to the hospital because I could not breathe at all, turns out snorting meth for a few days really fucks up your lungs. I was there for 3 days they obviously knew I was a drug addict. Tried getting me into treatment, I told them I wasn't ready. Whole time I was there my next ex-boyfriend was sneaking dope into the hospital for me. Got better, went home. Stopped taking my antibiotics before the script was out, which I didn't realise at the time that you shouldn't do that when you have pneumonia. So, about 2-3 weeks later, I couldn't breathe again. Back to the hospital, once again getting dope smuggled into me. This time though my boyfriend was sick at home so he couldn't keep doing it. They finally gave in to my withdrawals and whining and gave me Klonopin and Suboxone (idk wtf they were thinking). Once that kicked in I threw a fit screaming I wanted to go home and to get the doctor so I could sign myself out. I blacked out, walked home. I took a nap. My boyfriend and I got some money together went and copped. 2-3 weeks later, pneumonia was back AGAIN. This time my boyfriend disappeared with one of our methhead friends for like a whole day when I was counting on him to bring me dope so I could finally kick the pneumonia. Once he finally reappeared after me being the sickest I've ever been I immediately signed myself out of the hospital. I was there for like 30hrs tops. I threw an even bigger fit called the nurse's and doctors names. It was awful. Then finally another 2-3 weeks later I got pneumonia AGAAAIN. And this time my boyfriend and I were kicking the dope at home. We ran out of money shit was over we both knew it. Went back to the hospital. They refused to give me any thing, no anxiety meds, no sub, no nothing. They finally talked me into rehab. Made me call my mom and tell her that I was actively using heroin. My mom showed up at the hospital later that day and said if I didn't go to rehab she wasn't going to help me with anything anymore. And shes pretty much the only family I have so I just did it. At that point I had already detoxed in the hospital while also having pneumonia how much worse could it get?But like, it was just never my idea to get clean. Going into rehab I was legit doing it so my mom would help me. Then I ended up signing myself out of rehab 6 days before i was supposed to leave and losing my moms help anyway.I never had any intentions of long term sobriety.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr; i had pneumonia for like 3 months because i kept signing myself out of the hospital to do dope and anything else i could get my hands on.", "replies": {"fmzjf9j": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/fxznru/cant_stop_the_cravings/fmzjf9j/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1586551033.0, "body": "that was quite the read. well to me it sounds like you know what you want. if you don\u2019t want tot quit and don\u2019t quit then the cravings will never, ever go away. just remember you aren\u2019t alone in this. going to pick up some dope today", "replies": {"fmzrn2v": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/fxznru/cant_stop_the_cravings/fmzrn2v/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1586556896.0, "body": "Thanks man, youre probably right.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND COPYING MY APPROACH. \n_____________________________________________________\nI know that sounds crazy.\nLooks even crazier seeing it typed out,\nBut here's the story.   It needs to be told. \n\nI've been a substance abuser since my first joint at 16.\nNever had a D.O.C. in particular.\nJust really don't like being sober.\nAfter a car accident, I was prescribed a massive dose of Oxycontin.  This was when it was fairly new to the market. \nI was on it for close to 5 years with no interruption.\nIt was a constant daily stream of opiates.\nIt took losing my insurance to feel a single second of withdrawals.\nBy then it was too late.\nMy receptors were fried.\nThis is when I got angry and decided to suffer it out. \nI lasted 21 days before having a series of massive seizures that almost killed me.  At 6'1, I left the hospital weighing 120.5 lbs!\nThat's when I learned the difference between addicted and dependent \n\nI went on suboxone for 3 years, slowly weened myself off against my doctors wishes, and I was drug free for 6 years without a single relapse.\nBut something wasn't right.\nI felt low and incredibly depressed all the time. \nHad a really hard time functioning, experienced intense anxiety, and had zero motivation. \nAfter about 5 years of this, I turned to alcohol. \nI really never drank much before. \nIn fact, I drank twice in 6+ years because it reacted poorly with my anti-seizure medication. \nI soon found myself drinking more and more,\nEarlier and earlier. s. \nI went a year and a half without missing a day of sunrise to sunset drinking. \nGoing through a 750ml of Everclear a day. \nI knew I couldn't keep this up. \nI already recieved a DUI for sleeping in my car, \nAnd I never drove sober.\nIn fact, I drank more before driving.\nIt was only a matter of time before my second. \nBut I knew alcohol withdrawal can be dangerous. \nAfter confiding in a friend, she said that meth was sometimes used as a lesser evil to get off of other drugs. \nShe got me a gram, and it lasted me over a month. \nRarely drinking at first, then before I knew it, I had no urge to whatsoever!\n\nTo make a long story not religiously fucking long, \nI drums in a band. We play drinking themed punk metal songs.  After every show, I drink even more than usual, then risk driving home.  Dozens of times. \nMy most recent concert was the first show that I didn't get annihilated drunk after our performance. \nI made it 4/5 of the way home before seeing the red & blues light up behind me. \nIt was 1:30am, I was dressed like an asshole, and my entire car was stuffed with drums. \nI was apparently so alert, coherent, and well-spoken, that the officer didn't even mention alcohol it impairment.

Also, ask if you can skip doctor appointments and urine testing for at least the next three months.\n\n4) If you have an opiate habit and are currently using the illegal drug trade to obtain your drugs, BE PREPARED TO GO THROUGH INVOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL if your dealer(s) gets sick. Have backup plans that include increasing the number of dealers you can score off of, getting medical help (i.e. drug substitution programs) and make sure you have all the necessary medications, food and drinks (especially protein-based and electrolyte boosting liquids) you will need to detox off opiates (similar steps can be taken by those with habits to other drug types)\n\n5) STOCK UP ON DRUG USING EQUIPMENT/MATERIALS\nand get enough to last you at least 3 - 4 weeks (longer if you are high risk for infection and if programs can manage it)\n\n6) WIPE DOWN drug packages/wraps with alcohol-based cleansers after your dealer drops them off or once you've picked them up (a minimum 60% alcohol concentration has been shown to effectively kill the virus). If your dealers are in the habit of carrying dope in their mouths ask them if they can change this habit during this outbreak - if they won't, be careful handling the packages and do the cleaning as advised above. Remember that anti-bacterial washes don't kill viruses but can be better than nothing, especially if they contain alcohol\n\n7) AVOID PUTTING DRUG BAGS/WRAPS IN YOUR MOUTH, VAGINA OR ANUS. If you must carry it in your body, clean vigorously with an alcohol-based cleanser both before and after you take it out, and if carried in your mouth use an alcohol-based mouthwash afterwards\n\n8) WASH YOUR HANDS with soap and hot water vigorously for at least 20 seconds (but longer if you can) every time you come into contact with others, after handling money and after you get your drugs packages. Paper towels are preferred for drying hands, or at least use a clean towel\n\n9) PREPARE YOUR DRUGS YOURSELF and ensure that you don't handle or touch other people's equipment/drugs and don't let them touch yours\n\n10) If you have symptoms or think you're getting sick, AVOID GOING TO YOUR LOCAL HR PROGRAMS - HAVE THEM DELIVER TO YOU and tell them you are unwell so they can take the necessary precautions for their safety\n\n11) Be prepared for the POSSIBILITY OF NEEDLE EXCHANGES AND DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAMS CLOSING DOWN (and possibly drug detoxes) and follow steps 2, 3, 4 and 5 to reduce any problems related to running out of supplies or equipment\n\n12) Remember that people with compromised immune systems, lung diseases and other pre-existing conditions are more at risk of contracting COVID19 and help keep them safe by keeping yourself safe - follow these and other harm reduction tips to help you achieve this goal.\n\nThanks to Cheryl and Russel", "author": "Sillyoldactivist", "score": 25, "flair": null, "created": 1583286113.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/fcy8i4/comprehensive_hr_tips_for_drug_users_during_the/", "num_comments": 22, "title": "Comprehensive hr tips for drug users during the potential COVID19 pandemic", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"fje0e2a": {"score": 25, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/fcy8i4/comprehensive_hr_tips_for_drug_users_during_the/fje0e2a/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1583291562.0, "body": "Did someone take too much addy?", "replies": {"fje1snm": {"score": 11, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/fcy8i4/comprehensive_hr_tips_for_drug_users_during_the/fje1snm/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1583292356.0, "body": "I hope not, I've heard that stimulants can suppress the immune system.", "replies": {"fje9tg0": {"score": 11, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/fcy8i4/comprehensive_hr_tips_for_drug_users_during_the/fje9tg0/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1583296618.0, "body": "I've heard that stimulants help kill viruses actually.

Like I'll fiend for a couple days after I stop a run, but there's no long term cravings unlike with opiates. It's as if opiate addiction is preventing me from getting hooked on meth cause I can only ever crave opiates, however dumb that sounds haha. Probably helps that I have extensive experience with realizing when things are getting out of hand, so I can catch it and stop and take a while off.\n\nModeration and exercise as well as maintaining good mental health is key I think. Also extended breaks are essential for long term use of hard drugs imo (I take a 3 month break dead sober from everything every year).

Another two to three month break and felt nothing. Not sure why that is.\n\nTemazepam melted my anxiety away, felt euphoric and not sure how to explain the other feelings.

They're a former drug addict and I just found some stuff on their bed the other night (laying out in the open). I can only guess what this is, so upon confronting them about it, it's denial, denial, denial, take offense at the suggestion, denial, get incredibly upset, hate me, rinse and repeat. Plus, they're damn right when they say things like \"You don't even know what that is and you're going to come at me with this?!\"\n\nI've googled, but most articles are too vague for me or too specific towards something this isn't. It's a plastic bic pen that's had both ends removed. Both ends have melted a bit and there is a brown residue inside it. The person is on suboxone and they get a drug screening once a month. The area around where they live doesn't seem to do much drug testing on the weekends, so if they were to get high Friday night, I think they'd be in the clear by Monday.\n\nI've watched this person fall asleep while standing up... then fading like they're reaching to touch their toes, and just about defying gravity by all accounts. Having said all of that though, this \\*is\\* a good person and I care about them greatly. The consequences for them doing this and ultimately being caught though are... dire. I really hate being in this situation.\n\nUgh... Identification, advice, resources, or even just a good luck would be greatly appreciated as I'm not sure where to turn, who to ask - or hell, even what to do at this point.\n\nHere's the best I got on what I found:\n\n[https://rohjay.one/what-is-this/IMG\\_20200705\\_031624157.jpg](https://rohjay.one/what-is-this/IMG_20200705_031624157.jpg)\n\n[https://rohjay.one/what-is-this/IMG\\_20200705\\_031640839.jpg](https://rohjay.one/what-is-this/IMG_20200705_031640839.jpg)\n\n[https://rohjay.one/what-is-this/IMG\\_20200705\\_031703460.jpg](https://rohjay.one/what-is-this/IMG_20200705_031703460.jpg)\n\n[https://rohjay.one/what-is-this/IMG\\_20200705\\_031712108.jpg](https://rohjay.one/what-is-this/IMG_20200705_031712108.jpg)\n\n[https://rohjay.one/what-is-this/IMG\\_20200705\\_031723804.jpg](https://rohjay.one/what-is-this/IMG_20200705_031723804.jpg)\n\n[https://rohjay.one/what-is-this/IMG\\_20200705\\_031731533.jpg](https://rohjay.one/what-is-this/IMG_20200705_031731533.jpg)\n\nThanks for taking the time to even read this.

I am really just concerned about having what feels like a bruised/tender area on my chest, post potential narcan administration. Just wondering if anyone has any ideas as to what the painful area on my chest might be from and if I should be worried. Also am just curious as to how I lost consciousness in the first place from smoking what seemed like a very small amount and having no build up. I didn't even have a slight moment of \"I've had too much\" or \"I feel really fucked up\". \n\nEDIT: It is not internal chest pain. It feels like a bruise might feel (though without the actual bruise appearance).\n\n**My opiate background:**\n\nI was heavily addicted to smoking Oxy 80's 10+ years ago. Towards the end of my stint, I was smoking 8+ a day on average, and selling. On my heaviest days it was double that (that was abnormal though).\n\nIt started because I had back pain issues and a friend offered it to me. It spiraled from there. I had a love of how oxy made me feel. The energy and love of life it gave me was undeniable. They took all of my money and time, slowly became less effective, my hookups were unreliable, my access was drying up, and I had issues with withdrawals.\n\nEven with how heavy I used, I never OD'd or even came close to it. I still was in college, still passing classes, still paying my bills and doing the things I needed to do. I was always doing my best to be \"responsible\" to some degree. The obsession with oxy definitely negatively impacted my life, but not to a crazy degree (vs friends who saw more extreme negative consequences).\n\nI made the choice to stop and move away from home before the oxy completely dried up. Withdrawals were awful. I went on suboxone to ween myself off.\n\nI'm an adult now with a real life and job, but never quite kicked the love of opiates. They always gave me energy, happiness, and pain relief to a degree that I never quite got over. Even this many years after my life with opiates, I always yearned for them - any variety (I got some small doses for stuff like wisdom teeth removal over the years and still just loved the feeling).\n\n**Background on tonight:**\n\nI recently inadvertently found out that my neighbors were dealers. Idk what all they sell, but it was obvious because of all of the cars and activity. I happened to need to talk to them tonight. I was tipsy, and mentioned that I missed opiates. The guy mentioned said they had some and would share. I smoked some of a pill with them and was hanging out chatting.\n\nI don't know these people at all. They just live next to me and I'd never dealt with them before. All was initially good for 60+ minutes with a couple of them. I had only smoked a few hits (maybe 6?). It was just a standard looking pill. It wasn't an oxy. I should have asked what it was. Though idk if any answer would have been particularly meaningful to me. I've got zero experience with smoking things outside of oxy. I just didn't think it could possibly be anything more potent than oxy 80's. Definitely not more potent than the multiple 80's I smoked in my past. Even if it *was* more potent, I didn't think a few hits would be an issue.\n\nI used to have 50+ hits and be fine. I expected that if it felt potent - I'd feel that and stop. Smoking generally isn't one of those \"it hits you without warning\" methods of consumption...or at least so I thought.\n\n**What happened tonight:**\n\nThat first drag of this pill felt less potent than a standard 80 to me. Nothing terribly interesting or exciting, frankly it felt disappointing. My initial mental note - was \"I miss oxy and this is disappointing vs that, but nice anyways\". So I figured I'd hang out for a bit then head home.\n\nI woke up soaked in water, and surrounded by people (most who weren't even there from the start, who I didn't know) who were clearly alarmed. I started the night with 2 guys, then when I woke up there were 6 or more and all were acting so afraid for me. All talking and throwing out ideas for how I should be dealt with (give water, walking, cigarette, food, etc). I was so completely confused. Everything had seemed fine...I don't even remember feeling like I was overdoing things.\n\nRegardless, my initial thought was that sheer confusion. I was very confused as to why I was so soaking wet. I was confused as to why they were acting like something so bad had happened. It felt like no time had passed, nothing had happened. I had such a long history with opiates...I just was so confused. I never once previously OD'd or came even close to it. I was always very\n\nThey made me walk around the block with one of them. The guy I walked around the block with said I shouldn't sleep and kept acting like he was so concerned. I felt terrible that I had alarmed anyone and that this poor guy felt he needed to keep an eye on me.\n\nHe mentioned narcan...but my brain was just running a million miles a minute and I somehow didn't even think to try to figure out what had happened. I don't know if he was saying I needed narcan or had been given it. The guy seemed pretty out of it.\n\nI walked with him for 20 minutes. He was confused as to why I seemed so okay and he thought maybe he and his friends had overreacted.\n\nI was just so alarmed that I was wet, with no recollection regarding how I got wet. I was really just so shocked and embarrassed by the whole thing. I am a control freak and never ever lose control of myself in front of others. I unfortunately didn't ask any questions even though I should have.\n\nI have such a long history with opiates that I never expected I'd overdose...I still don't get it. Especially since I was just smoking a pill.\n\n**My concerns now:**\n\nI went home and have just been sitting and thinking. I feel as mildly \"high\" as I did before coming to my senses wet and surrounded by people. Nothing wild or noteworthy, just slightly physically relaxed. I won't sleep tonight just to be safe.\n\nMy chest is very painful right now though. Not internally, but externally as though there is a bruise there. It hurts when I breathe deeply or place my hand on my chest. I didn't feel painful initially at all (it's been 3 hours since I got home). I have no bruising or marks.\n\nI am curious if anyone has any idea what the external chest bruising type pain might be from? I see that narcan is generally administered nasally. Even if it was some other form of narcan that was given as a shot to the chest...I wouldn't think I would feel even slightly high still? I know very little about narcan though, so am just googling and trying to learn what I can.\n\nShould I be concerned? I mean moreso than this entire night has made me?", "author": "abadnight09throwaway", "score": 6, "flair": "Opioids", "created": 1601226512.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/j0o325/idk_what_happened_tonight_and_am_trying_to/", "num_comments": 19, "title": "Idk what happened tonight and am trying to unravel it", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"g6tisq5": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/j0o325/idk_what_happened_tonight_and_am_trying_to/g6tisq5/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1601227206.0, "body": " Chest pain could be a number of things, only a few of which are bad.

Seemed completely normal. Just didn\u2019t like living a normal life and liked hitch hiking and traveling which is something I had been wanting to do. He and I took the bus out to the beach and hung out for the day and made a plan to hitchhike to Tampa together. That was about 7 hours from where we were in the panhandle which was a real trip. Nevertheless dude knew the ropes and swore we\u2019d be fine. The next day we head out about 3 pm. We make it back out to the beach to start walking and holding our thumb out. Before we started walking dude busts out a bag of meth that I had no idea he had. I didn\u2019t think the guy did drugs. Long story short after a few hours of hitchhiking he was being super fucking controlling and started acting completely different after doing the ice so I was like fuck this. Dude flagged a car down and they were offering to drive us 3 hours and I told the dude fuck you bye. He begged for a couple minutes while I walked the other way and then was gone. So as I\u2019m walking back this hood ass dude pulls up and was like \u201cYo white boy it\u2019s hot as fuck out here. You wanna ride?\u201d So I throw my bag in his car and he asks where I\u2019m going and I tell him just back to town. I tell him I really appreciate it and I have no money to offer but I said idk if you know anyone but here\u2019s a suboxone strip you can sell to someone for like 20$. Turns out this dude sold subs when he could get them. He ended up buying 10 of them from me for 15$ a piece so I had him drop me off at the greyhound station. \n\nI was still in the mood to explore but I didn\u2019t want to walk with my thumb up or anything like that. I decided I was gonna take greyhounds from city to city exploring and I would sell subs at the stations to get from place to place. With the money I had I bought a ticket to Mobile, Al and had enough when I got there to buy a ticket to New Orleans next. So I get to Mobile and start exploring downtown and I had bought a ticket to New Orleans for the next night. I was gonna explore mobile. Sleep in the station and then explore again the next day and then leave. So I do that and the next day as I\u2019m almost time to leave I meet this lady(straight milf) going to rehab. She was shy about it so I was all like don\u2019t feel bad I\u2019m on subs. Her eyes lit up and asked if I had any. I didn\u2019t wanna fuck up her rehab trip but she said they were gonna make her cold turkey off roxys and begged to buy one for 50$. I immediately was like fuck yes. So she goes to get on her bus as they\u2019re calling for it and she runs back to me and grabs my hand and pulls me in the bathroom and hands me another $50 and says one more please so of course I sell it to her.\n\nNow I\u2019ve got a little money under my belt so I can eat and buy my next ticket in New Orleans to Houston and I\u2019m feeling happy about things. I take off on the bus and get to New Orleans and same thing. I explore for a day. Sleep in the station and then explore some the next day. I happen to meet a dude that\u2019s got a bunch of crack. I had never smoked it but I gave him 20$ to be able to smoke with him and it was a fun time. Lol. The next day I take off to Houston. I get there at night time and underestimated this city. \n\nHouston\u2019s greyhound is in the middle of downtown and there\u2019s homeless people EVERYWHERE. At night the massive parking lots are completely filled with homeless people sleeping using the concrete blocks that stop your tires in a parking spot as pillows. After having to eat expensive greyhound food and spending money stupidly I was down to not much and stuck in Houston. I couldn\u2019t find anyone to buy any subs and I literally had no family to help me out or anything. Things were going downhill. So what I did was bought a bus ticket and took a bus way outside of downtown where I could fly a sign and hopefully get out of this city. Lol. Finally after several hours of flying a sign saying \u201cWill work for a bus ticket home\u201d someone picked me up and took me to their shop where they worked and bought me a ticket all the way back to my city. \n\n\nThis was longer than I intended but it\u2019s one of my many adventures. I wasn\u2019t super descriptive with things so it wouldn\u2019t be even longer but there was a lot more that happened than I included.

If I ever want to do normal things like go to the springs or head to the movies, he's one of the only people that would be down (I'm in recovery now, but at this time I was shooting up 4 or 5 times a day) He also had his roommates and other friends so if I ever wanted to do something social and feel normal instead of sitting around the trap house he was my guy. And he never judged me and was never worried about taking me to his friends parties. \n\nWe had done drugs together since highschool, and he's tried pretty much everything. And whenever I would come to his house I would offer him whatever I had, and he never said no. It became kind of a ritual, and I tried to change it up every time. I bring some blow, or some molly, suboxone...\n\nOn this particular night I forgot to bring my suboxone with me, and we were going to a private pool party so I just brought alcohol. I thought I'd be okay but at 3 AM I was going through it my skin was crawling I was sweating, you know the deal. In a desperate gamble I called one of my new dealers I had just met recently. \"Yo who dis?\" \"Its juicy Jay man, the white dude. I live across from the boat house?\" The line is silent. I quickly say \"c'mon man I ride with your brother smoke all the time! I'm outside his mom's house like every other day!\" His response was slow and drawn out, or maybe I was just fiending so hard time had slowed down. \"Oooooooooooh Jaaaay. Whatchu need man.\" I sputtered, speaking as quickly as I could. I need a gram of some catdog (that's what we call heroin) I'm out here in (city thirty minutes away). He smacks his lips \" bruh ion know if I can ride all the way out there for just a g bruh.\" I fumble into my pockets and dig out all the money I have. \"I've got 137$ man that's it.\" To which he responded \"aight aight I'm comin but be ready.\" I returned to the apartment. I paced the floor for a while and started taking shots of vodka. 3:25....3:45...I kept calling him and his gentle reassurances did nothing to lessen my anxiety. \"I'm coming bro I'll be there soon\"...\n\nMy eyes fluttered open, then I exploded out of my chair. 6 missed calls and 4 unread messages that read as follows. \"Otw be ready\" \"bro I'm here\" \"come outside bro pick up the phone\" and lastly, \"are you fucking serious you made me drive way out here for nothing\" the last message was only sent 10 minutes ago. I called him with pure dread. I was sure I had blown it. He answers. \"Bro what the fuck man you got me wasting my time coming out here for nothing what the fuck kinda games a..\" I quickly cut him off. \"Dude I fell asleep I swear I'm sorry bro please I still need it can you turn around?\" He sighs deeply and says yeah he will be back in ten minutes. I went and sat outside on a garbage can to wait. A few minutes later my eyes shoot open. What the fuck. I had passed out on the garbage can I was so drunk, right in clear view of the whole apartment complex. My phone, which had been in my hand, lay on the ground beside me. I had e missed calls and he was currently calling me again. Now he was really pissed. \"Bro what the fuck.\" \"I'm outside I'm outside where are you?\"\n\nWe meet up and the deal goes down. He even gave me 2 full grams even though I was a little short. I find I nice black car and pull out one of the bags of pure white powder. That's right i couldn't even wait to get back inside before i hit a massive line. I stumbled into the apartment and passed out on the couch. The next day i tell my friend i have a surprise for him. That's what i always say when i bring drugs for him. But I tell him \"theres a catch this time. You cant ask me what it is. Why he says, laughing. Because it will be a surprise it's more fun. He's not having it. He thinks it's some research psychedelic and he has to work later. \"Cmon you know you can trust me bro.\" I keep telling him I cant tell him what it is, or else he cant have any. After he asks 16 times I just get annoyed and tell him its crushed dilaudid. He did some, and enjoyed it. I gave him the tiniest line then split that in half. He did the half and said that's all he needed. To thos day I feel like shit. Idk why I didn't just tell him what it was. He might not have even cared. Had to tell this wonderful and oh so fucked up story. I've felt bad all these years about the lie. Which I should.

Went cold turkey, skipped town, cut everyone off and called it a day. \n\nFast forward to 7 years ago when I met my wife. Didn't take long (48 hours) to figure out she was a full blown addict... Rx opiates. Against my better judgement I stayed with her, fell for her, married her, and had a kid with her. I finished my degree, became an engineer, and we live a \"normal life\".\n\nBut her demon has always been there, courtesy of degenerative disc dissorder. Doctor hopping, ER visits, rehab stints with AMA discharges, hitting up old ladies to get ER scripts and sell them to her... the works.\n\n4 years ago I ruptured a few discs at work (so much for a safe desk job). I wound up in pain management and on morphine. I'm physically addicted, but I actually hate the \"high\" and refuse to become mentally addicted again.\n\nRegrettably, the withdrawals are true hell. I'll take meth withdrawals any day of the week over this shit.\n\nMy wife overcame her full demon level addiction about a year ago. Since then, she's been on self-maintenance. Which is to say when i get my script we \"share\" until they're gone, then drink poppy seed tea until my next script. Keeps the withdrawals away, but frankly costs a fortune, is getting harder to get, and the alkaloid content is hit or miss (more miss than hit lately). \n\nI'm fucking sick of it. Sick of the money, sick of making and drinking the tea, sick of the whole fucking thing. But both of us are completely physically addicted and in genuine pain to boot.\n\nAll the addiction clinics that do maintenance in the Phoenix area either swear by full \"detoxing\" (sorry, nope) or will only run methadone/suboxone maintenance either after a inpatient rehab stay (30-120 days) or by daily dispensing... 1 dose, in person at the office, every single day.\n\nWe both have jobs, real careers actually. We also have a family, bills, responsibilities. Those templates work great for folks at the rock bottom, but don't do shit for those who have already clawed their way out and just need the maintenance to keep the withdrawals off.\n\nSo I'm considering returning to the street. Find a dealer who can keep a steady stream of something flowing to keep the maintenance up.\n\nProblem is, i left the streets behind 15 years ago. Everyone i was in with back then is dead, locked up, or straight. I have no contacts, i don't know how to get back in, and apparently i'm more permafry than i thought cuz i can't even figure out how to find the shit on the internet despite thousands of news stories talking about the prevalence of online drug sales.\n\nI'm a fat middle aged white guy in polo shirts driving a black Tahoe. If I went wondering the van buren areas of PHX looking for a hook up i'd be dead before I got back to my car.\n\nSo how the fuck do i get back into those circles and find a dealer?

I don't use them anymore and part of the reason I have to take the Diazepam is to keep me from not seizing. I'm constantly sedated and can take 150+mg of Diazepam and not feel much, it's sad. \n\nANYWAYS...I can get Provigil 200mg if I want it, but didn't ask last time and see her every 3 months...so out I went in hope of some uppers. I wanted crack or cocaine as that's my usual once in awhile upper (I can honestly use them responsibly and don't binge or repeat buy). \nWell, NOPE, of course all that was around was fucking crank. I'm such a dumbass I traded 8 subs and 4 Valiums for about $40 worth. I got ripped off on a drug I don't even like that much :/\nI'm not a fan of it unless I'm on heavy barbiturates when I use it to stay awake on high Barb doses and function. \n\nIt's not a \"fun\" drug for me, sure I get the euphoria but not like when I was 21 (31 now) and too much of it makes me anxious, AND my fiancee used to have a major meth addiction (I did from 20-21 and easily quit) so today was quite the shitshow. I felt ashamed and stupid and like I betrayed the only person I love. \n\nI smoked 4 large shards off tinfoil and of course now I'm too spun to sleep, and I can't waste anything but 2 Valiums and large dose Phenibut. My heart feels whack, I know I need to crash and take more Diazepam. \n\nDoes anyone else get pissed that the only reliable upper (at least where I'm at) is Crystal Meth?! It's in-fucking-sa ne, it's everywhere, it's taken over completely. I hate the shit but I'll do it for an up when I want to game hard, but alas my fiancee can't use it rec like I can. So I ended up dumping most of it and saving some, which should last me awhile. I smoke it only, I hate the feeling from railing it. And now I'm hiding some from my fiancee saying \"oh I dumped it all\"....FML. \n\nI'm asking advice from all you hardcore old school tweakers out there - is it super dangerous to mix with downers? I used to with Barbiturates (especially Phenobarbital) but I'm 31 now and have chronic pancreatitis and don't feel \"safe\" on it like I used to. \nAny answers or advice would be GREATLY appreciated! I feel like I need to throw the rest out. I'm on one right now, and I don't binge with meth, I make sure to sleep and eat. This is my last time with this shit.

I know the lifestyle and even now, I'm not really sober. I jumped on the Suboxone train and now I\nstay away from all that, swapping out one addiction for another, but in the end I don't believe the drug would have killed me before that lifestyle did and Suboxone for me was a means to an end as well as a chance to start over .\n\n\n\nI'm not here to preach. Enjoy your high, savor it, for all the work we all have to  put into to reaching that pinnacle of artificial euphoria , for fucks sake, *enjoy it.* I don't want to harsh anyone's mellow, if you can see where I'm going I recommend you leave the thread now so that I don't. \n\n\n\nIf I still have you, then cool, thanks for hearing me out because I didn't know where else to dump this load of raw emotions. So many friends I watch died from this life or may as well be dead, a lot of it could have been prevented, but going off on the state of Florida's idea of 'harm reduction' being, and I quote, 'smoke weed over shooting dope' you can easily see why they ended up that way. If it were just that easy, than I'm sure at some point, everyone would want to trade the needle for bong hits. This same state puts drug dealers on death row if they're associated with fatal overdoses. The first of which I knew personally. Joey Colon wasn't an addict. He wouldn't have sold that girl fentanyl (unless she asked for it). He was selling dope to support his three daughters whose mother overdosed years ago after having their third. He wasn't a user himself. He didn't know. He just needed money and now he has no money nor a future. His children have no parents.  \n\n\n\nEven now, I watch a friend of mine, a father of four children, try to sustain his and his baby mama's habit while   playing the father role in public to those that don't know he's getting high. He failed at sobriety every chance he was given. He wasn't ready to get clean. He wasn't ready to be a dad four fold either, but he chose to drag his children down with him. Just last week, he was at work while his unemployed gf OD'D with kids in the house. Now he really wants to get his DCF court date over with so he can get high again, of course. \n\n\n\nDo what you do. But don't drag others , especially a child , down with you. They didn't ask for parents who are too fucked up to pay them any mind, or that pawn / sell their toys for another baggie of heroin, or those that will ultimately be dead in a gutter at the rate they're going. The kids will be long gone, taken by the state, that's the real casualty of it all. It pulls at my heart and soul. I have nothing against anyone living the life . Just don't bring a child into this world at the same time. Especially not several . An addiction needs as much nurturing and will almost always take priority over them whether it's realized or not  by you or them. Find them somewhere safe until you can find it in yourself to trade dope for Parenthood. This is all I ask, /r/drugs . If you're currently living this life, **employ harm reduction** to the best of your ability.\n\n\n\n\nUtilize those needle exchange programs. I believe FL only has one. Not sure even where it's at. If you can get ahold of Narcan, keep it for there is always a chance that you or  someone you're close with goes too far. Use micron filters in your rigs. Get some sterilized water and aim to use fresh needles, and of course, don't share those fuckers or water or any of your shit with anyone else. Maybe you'll last a little longer, but none of these things can protect you from people you associate with, the angry dealer you owe money to, the desperate junkie trying to score on a budget, so on and so forth.\n\n\n\nTread carefully, my brothers and sisters . Someone out there cares about you. I care about you. We want to see you around for several more years to come and you deserve this as well. Remember that. And when you're ready to kick the habit or make a change, there's a shit ton of support out there for you, in the US, now there's more than there ever was.

Help I've been taking X for X amount of time. I always try to respond to those posts especially if someone else hasn't. If someone's already said what I have to say then I really don't have to much to add. But here's something for those that may be posting here looking for help or advice, this is only my experience please treat it as such. Few years ago I got heavily involved in a drug called clonazolam, it truly is the one that whupped my ass . And I've been doing drugs for roughly 30 years. So here goes:\n\nSometime around 2014 my source for xanax dried up. So I did what all people do and hit the information superhighway to find a fix for that. RC's popped up so I went that route. I was introduced to a well known now defunct place that was reliable. Don't bother asking it's gone and even if it wasn't I wouldn't tell you. prior to this I was a heroin addict who got on suboxone because I cannot seem to keep a needle out of my arm, all around successful human being though. good job, family, decently well off.\n\nWell clonazolam allowed me to not feel like I was the odd man out. Essentially killed my anxiety like a man drops when he gets a direct shot to the nuts. I like not being anxious (like every other sane human being does). so I kept at it. first it was .5mg, then 1 mg and before I knew it (like all things benzo it happened real fast and I wondered how the fuck I got there) I was at around 5 -8mg a day. That's a LOT of benzos probably somewhere along the lines of 20-25mg of Xanax a day. And boy howdy was I stuck there. \n\nI do dumb shit, but I'm not a dumb ass per se and I knew what would happen if I stopped abruptly. I would 100% seize and likely die or at the very least stop breathing. Had I still been doing heroin at the time I would 100% be dead right now. I was in a bad place. I tried to taper and was moderately successful. Actually that's a bit of an understatement I got down to .5mg plus 2mg diclazepam. It took me 1 full year. That's 365 days of tapering. And it was brutal. I would shake (now I realize I was close to seizing) and my muscles would twitch. Not like a muscle spasm the common person would have I mean my eyelids, cheeks tiny muscle groups. I looked like I had fuckin Parkinson. The anxiety... Holy shit. The anxiety I used benzos for was nothing compared to this. You wanna sleep?! fuck that try again later bitch. Horrendous. And I STILL wasn't off them I was still stuck. If i tried to decrease the dose by so little as .1mg of diclazepam I couldn't even get out of bed. SO I did what no one in the history of mankind has ever wanted to do before. I asked for help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI ditched my current sub doctor since he hadn't noticed the fact that I looked like a zombie straight from the walking dead and that I hadn't used my own urine in 4  goddamn YEARS. And began the search for a doctor that could help me. I was shot down immediately and pretty much every doctor responded with, \"I get you are trying to do the right thing but you're in the midst of a medical emergency. Go to the hospital.\" And they were right. So I gave it one last shot. I found a doctor online who was well respected and went in hat in hand to beg for drugs. Much to my surprise she looked at me and said, \"normally I would just send you to detox but there's a doctor I know who I think could really help you.\" This woman handed me a number to call and said, \"I'm going to send him the notes from our visit if it's okay with you, and I'm going to refund your money because I couldn't help you.\" This shocked me because one, she knew someone who could help and two, she gave me all my money back. \n\nThis became a turning point. I found a doctor that didn't accept insurance (for some reason the insurance part of visiting a doctor seemed to be a defining moment of whether they prescribed benzos at all) but would see me and she thought after hearing my story he could help me. So I went in and I talked plainly. I told this doctor everything, my fear of seizing my fear of losing my job by going to detox and my family finding out. He looked at me and said, \"we'll try it.\" He wrote me a script and I went slowly each increment was made weekly or bi weekly and reductions were 1/4 or a .125mg ODT clonazepam wafer. That was roughly 14 months ago. All told it took me almost 2 and a half years to beat an addiction to this drug. Now I don't blame this drug at all. Drugs aren't sentient. They do not set out to hurt you any more then rat poison sets out to hurt you. Every pill, powder, solution, needle I ever touched was with my own hand with my own intent. To blame drugs themselves for a drug addiction is tantamount to blaming a car for when and if you wreck it. \n\nbut I would like to say I am not the same. My anxiety is pretty bad, but I do something about it now. meditation, CBD, therapy. I have to do it because if I don't all this was for nothing. I have memory problems, difficulty concentrating. Sometimes I watch a TV show or read a book and all of a sudden I don't know whats going on pages and minutes have gone by with little to no retention. I have some anger issues and sleeps difficult, But I am alive. I didn't seize and life is okay today even in the midst of everything that's going on. Anyway, if you actually read this thanks. I credit this random doctor and the ashton method for where I am at right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nlink to the method helped me.

Mostly these are pain related, as when he was younger he broke a lot of things and had a few concussions. He's had surgery on his neck, foot and also has a spinal stimulator though that has not exactly done a whole lot for him. He also used to have a drug abuse problem, and for the past year or so he's been on suboxone. I know that you can't drink alcohol or take a lot of different drugs when on suboxone. From the start of the year though, he started taking ambien to help him sleep at night. From what I gather from Google, you're not supposed to take ambien and suboxone though. Whenever he would take it, he would act really weird. Say incoherent things, just stand around, put things in the microwave he shouldn't, eat A LOT, try to leave at like 10 PM to go to work, etc. I would always have to get him to go to bed, which sometimes was really difficult. After each time I'd tell him to please stop taking the ambien and he would apologize and stop for a little while. But he's done this again and again about 4-5 times now. A month ago though, he got more ambien and took some like really early (4PM\\~ish) and started acting weird again. This time though, he would forget that he took some and would take more and more, in a cycle, and I didn't realize this was happening until like 1 AM and I took them away. He ended up getting really mad and was still completely out of it, before finally I was able to get him to sleep at like 3 AM. Again, he apologizes, says he doesn't remember, and says he'll stop. Now just the other day, he takes some again, this time though, my mom holds onto them so she can give him only the amount he needs to sleep. What happens though is that he kept trying to get more and more, looking for the pill bottle and getting upset but then acting dumb cuz he again, just completely out of it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince then, I THINK he hasn't been taking them. But.... he still act... not normal? He just doesn't look right. Not necessarily incoherent, but just does weird things that he wouldn't do normally. I'm not sure if he has managed to get more, and is taking smaller dosages just to get high or what's going on. I should mention he takes a lot of different drugs for many reasons. He multiple things for blood pressure, stuff for cholesterol, suboxone, testosterone, stuff for shingles. Takes benadryl to help him sleep. He also takes 'natural' things like fish oil, l-theanine, GABA, etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo does anyone have thoughts on what's going on? Is he getting high? I know he's a life long addict... Or is just his age? A combination? I'm not sure and I'm just really worried about him...", "author": "bobwillie11", "score": 5, "flair": "Long Post", "created": 1591419496.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/gxcxwq/my_64_year_old_father_takes_many_different_drugs/", "num_comments": 12, "title": "My 64 Year Old Father Takes Many Different Drugs and Has Recently Starting Acting..

I tried to reach out to a Redditor on here, who went through the same a year ago, but I didn\u2019t get a response, what makes me naturally assume the worst... \n\nNobody knew/knows that I was on suboxone for a long time... It started in 2016 and in 2017 I took a small break, which came easy to me, because I finally escaped a very violent relationship and had new hope for my life... I fucked up, when someone gave me a three weeks supply of adderall and a weeks supply of Xanax (the worst withdrawal I ever felt BTW) ... Of course I had a hard time after the adderall ran out and my violent ex lurked me back with suboxone and more of my favorite drug adderall... When he came back home against my will, the abuse was worse than ever and when I got him arrested the second time, I was so fucked up from the trauma, I was unable to stop. \n\nThe depression at this point was awful. I moved to the states in 2011 and literally had not one person over there, who gave a shit about me, besides my suboxone supplier, who went through her own hell, after losing her infant son a long time ago. We bonded over our abusive exes and I always had someone who would \u201chelp me out\u201d... She was the only one, who knew my secret. Everybody thought I was clean, since 2018... But now here I am, taking gabapentin and ibuprofen to get through the worst days... it\u2019s day 6 and I have this annoying headache in my forehead and the chills all day long, not to mention the gross toxins I am sweating out... \n\nI am playing my part, because I haven\u2019t seen my family in six years and should be the happiest, yet I feel like a stranger in my own home country within my own family.... Not to mention that I want to scream and cry all fucking day long and just find someone I can talk to about this shit... I am in a small town right now and support groups are not a thing... I just wish my energy would come back already, I feel so lazy and just want to be able to sleep at night-soon my gabpentin will run out too, then... I AM REALLY FUCKED... Of course I am hoping by then the worst is over, but I was on that crap way too long, to think it will be that easy... My ex got me hooked on every drug on the planet, made me try everything, lying that it\u2019s nothing... I fucked my back up 2015 and since then I depend on pain-meds and gabapentin works great, but that\u2019s not a medicine I can just get in Germany...\ud83d\ude2d I don\u2019t even have insurance here, to even get help... MF-Shit... I just want to know, if I am the only one, that feels that way... I should be grateful to be here, yet I am sad and depressed...

I remember an instance of finding a small metal pipe in the shape of a skull under the ashtray in an old Camaro my father kept in the yard; after the discovery I was told to stay away from it because of supposed snakes hiding in the tall grass. At the time we lived in a single wide trailer in a small remote community, even at a young age the presence of narcotics was hard to avoid. I remember an older boy around the age of 11 once showing me a bottle of pills that I later learned were OxyContin. Once I had visited his house and his mom was passed out with only a towel on, I remember a distinct feeling of disgust and shame. At the time I didn\u2019t understand why it seemed like this boy didn\u2019t care; seemed to show no embarrassment at this spectacle.  I understand now that he was conditioned to expect this, and perhaps to look forward to it. He quickly found her purse and took some money and several tablets of OxyContin.  He offered me one and I turned it down, by this time in my life it had never occurred to me to take narcotics.  I simply didn\u2019t understand why people took drugs. \n\nFor the next few years my experiences with drugs were peripheral at most, I remember a large conversion van that my relatives would try to hide smoking pot in at family barbecues, finding roaches in ashtrays; by this time it had still not occurred to me to actually try marijuana, let alone any of the harder narcotics. \n\nAround the time I entered 6th grade my grades had begun to slip, I believe this was mostly due to a lack of interesting the subject matter. I was always reading books and had an insatiable appetite for information, my free time was often split between reading and computer games, playing swords outside with sticks and twigs.  I was soon diagnosed with ADHD and that is where I believe my lifelong addiction began. At first non stimulant drugs were tried with little success, however when I was switched to adderall I discovered what taking drugs actually felt like. Information seemed to blast through my mind at lightning speed, it not only helped with my failing grades, but made my life in general more enjoyable. \n\nI had fallen in with the Post-goth/post-punk subculture in school. My mother wouldn\u2019t let me dress in the way I would have liked so I started to buy my own clothes and sneak them into school to change into.  I hung around the margins of school cliques, I was closest to one other boy in particular, a young gay man let\u2019s call him L that would become a lifelong friend. I attempted to pass as a homosexual, more to fit in than for any other reason, I noticed this being the case for allot of young girls and boys in the early 00\u2019s during the wider spread emergence of the gay acceptance movement.  I never really had a homosexual attraction to any man but one, and it never went anywhere. \n\nMy access to pharmaceutical speed made me popular among the counter culture of the small town I lived in, I soon began to sell and trade my medication, and experimented with other drugs. Xanax and Percocet were the most readily available as they were widely overprescribed at that time. My male love interest had a mother that was dying a slow death from cancer and that\u2019s where we got all the good stuff, Opaina (SP?), OxyContin, all the Xanax we needed. She would continue to be our source of narcotics until she died recently.  \n\nMy middle school use of drugs was incidental and to be honest I can\u2019t even say I knew the extent of my addiction. I finally realized my need for drugs when I was separated from my source. I was expelled from school because of an incident of attempted arson when I threw a makeshift Molotov cocktail on the roof of the school. It wasn\u2019t for any particular reason, I didn\u2019t wish to harm anyone or the school and the damages were negligible.  I was sent to a alternative school. The alternative school was mixed 6th through 12th grade and consisted of only kids who had committed pretty harsh offenses. Since I hadn\u2019t made any connections for narcotics there I felt the horrible wretch of pill sickness for the first time.  I was robbed more than once attempting to trade my adderall for OxyContin. I fought back once and had my head split open. Requiring several stitches.  I had no friends in the alternative school and hated going. \n\nI was released back to regular school at the start of 9th grade. Since I had been kicked out before I had began to grow a reputation. I got in fights often, usually over small insults or misunderstandings.  I soon met a willing accomplice in a friend I\u2019ll refer to as J. J was a short sticky kid who had a reputation of his own for fighting a couple of upper class men and winning spectacularly.  I came to find out he could get marijuana in bulk, high quality and cheap. We began to run a small empire moving several pounds a week both at school and home. I had found out how to reset the Combination locks on the unassigned lockers and hid product in there. When we were paid I would give the customer the locker number and combo I\u2019d left the product in. We later expanded to morphine, Xanax, and anything else we could get our hands on. \n\nWhen the bupernophine clinics opened up we started sponsoring adult addicts clinic bills in exchange for half their medication.  This turned into a enterprise that crossed state lines, made six figures and resulted in the deaths of 3 people via robbery gone wrong.  It continues without my involvement to this day. \n\nThe business went as follows. We would find a broke drug addict, preferably ex heroin users, but oxy or Percocet users worked just as good. We would offer the  addict a full ride, we paid for the clinic visits and prescription bills. In exchange for most of the medication. Usually the deal was that the addict gets one pill a day, when in reality at the time they were often prescribed 3 or 4 per day.  To make sure the doctors would write for Sobutec instead of suboxone (witch only went for 20$ instead of 40). We would rub the addict down with fiberglass insulation after their first visit and have them complain, most often the doctors were convinced that the patient was allergic to naloxone; and would prescribe the more profitable sobutec. \n\nWe had three people who would drive the addicts to clinics, provide cash, and take payment via medication. The pills were then moved in the same circles as our other product.", "author": "Big_Nature_1223", "score": 5, "flair": "Long Post", "created": 1600274839.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/itru8m/how_i_became_a_teenage_drug_kingpin/", "num_comments": 11, "title": "How I became a teenage drug kingpin.", "subreddit": "drugs", "comments": {"g5gljj4": {"score": 18, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/itru8m/how_i_became_a_teenage_drug_kingpin/g5gljj4/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1600284081.0, "body": "haven\u2019t even read it and can tell this is probably made up lmao", "replies": {"g5hhqm8": {"score": 4, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/itru8m/how_i_became_a_teenage_drug_kingpin/g5hhqm8/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1600303008.0, "body": "Made up or not, its a surprisingly good read", "replies": {}}, "g5h4ycv": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/itru8m/how_i_became_a_teenage_drug_kingpin/g5h4ycv/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1600296688.0, "body": "Can't even spell Subutex right.", "replies": {}}, "g5gnht2": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/itru8m/how_i_became_a_teenage_drug_kingpin/g5gnht2/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1600285810.0, "body": "is it?", "replies": {}}}}, "g5h8w7q": {"score": 6, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/itru8m/how_i_became_a_teenage_drug_kingpin/g5h8w7q/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1600298684.0, "body": "Funny innit it would be even better if it was real", "replies": {}}, "g5gpfnc": {"score": 6, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/itru8m/how_i_became_a_teenage_drug_kingpin/g5gpfnc/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1600287349.0, "body": "I call bullshit", "replies": {}}, "g5gt21z": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/itru8m/how_i_became_a_teenage_drug_kingpin/g5gt21z/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1600289874.0, "body": "Can't lie bro, I think you've made this up lol", "replies": {"g5gv8wo": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/itru8m/how_i_became_a_teenage_drug_kingpin/g5gv8wo/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1600291265.0, "body": "how so", "replies": {}}}}, "g5gekbn": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/itru8m/how_i_became_a_teenage_drug_kingpin/g5gekbn/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1600276505.0, "body": "Thank bc we asked for a depressing story at 5:14 am", "replies": {}}, "g5kp6cq": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/itru8m/how_i_became_a_teenage_drug_kingpin/g5kp6cq/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1600371135.0, "body": "Cap", "replies": {}}, "g5giofj": {"score": 0, "link": "/r/Drugs/comments/itru8m/how_i_became_a_teenage_drug_kingpin/g5giofj/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1600281160.0, "body": "I had realized the potential of a Sobutec black market when I was  first introduced to it. I was in sophomore English and a student next to me was crushing a pill in paper.  I asked him about it and he told me it was like synthetic heroin.  Beginner Sobutec (commonly referred to as tec) users  can experience a intense euphoric sedation akin to a high dose of OxyContin on less Than a 16th of a pill. Tolerance takes a long time to build up, eventually the user isn\u2019t even getting high anymore. Ill estimate that this begins around 2-3 months after the user starts Needing a full pill to feel the effects.  Addicts usually start out buying on the street, staying high off of 1-3 pills a week at 40$ a pop, but eventually the user will find that even 2-3 pills a day will do almost nothing; by this point the user will find himself experiencing moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms within 12 hours of their last dose.  After this you have 3 options. 1 cold turkey(never works)  2 taper down buying pills on the street/go to a doctor by themselves  ( low rate of success , can cost a shitload of money) or option 3 Find someone like me who was willing to pay your entire way in exchange for the lions share of the medications.   \n\n\nSobutec and Suboxone have been praised as wonder drugs for opiate dependency. doctors say it cannot be snorted or used IV, and that risk of misuse are low.   \n\n\nHere are the facts  BuP can absolutely be used nasally or by IV, and risk of misuse is high if not ubiquitous\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI spent my teenage years exploiting this system as I know thousands of others have.

His life became about maintaining day time appearances while hustling at night just to get a hit of anything.  Right under our noses he was swapping his Suboxone for H and we were none the wiser.  He would pack it into different compartments on his truck and his associates would apparently park around the corner and sneak up to the vehicle or other hiding locations he had made to drop or pickup the drugs.  \nOne of the hardest parts is that we unknowingly enabled his behavior.  Even when we realized he was much worse off than we ever imagined, we knew we had to ask him to leave.   As he had only declined and never improved.\nI 1st gave him a chance to own his addiction to my hubby but instead he began a 4 day partying spree.  I internally debated for days on how to tell my hubby and how he would react to not being told immediately. The kids were thankfuly gone for a few weeks.  \n\nI really wanted to give his friend the chance to own it and really ask for help as the offer to give him more help was always declined.  In the end he had to go somewhere else as we had kids to think about.  Unfortunately I had to tell the hubby.  We informed E that we had exhausted all our resources and we had nothing else to offer.  He was asked to leave immediately.  His truck was smashed to pieces due to multiple random accidents he had in a 3 month period  each with a random excuse as to what happened.\n\nWe tossed him out hoping he would realize he needed to seek more treatment.  We removed him from the home to ensure our children would not be in danger.  My hubby was broken but wouldn't admit it.  The ex roommate only spiraled even further from reality after the eviction.  The couple who took him in told E to do what he wants just clean up after yourself.  \n\nE only declined further than ever.  On Friday the 7th, shortly after midnight we received that call we hoped to never get.  We were informed E just passed from a suspected OD.  His last few FB posts read almost like a suicide letter starting 3 days prior to the OD and up to an hour before his demise.  (Apologies as these were not the final posts, the final 2 were about getting help now before time was out)\nWe only wanted to provide him with help and allow him to see his natural talents but his soul had already vanished.  May he now find that peace and acceptance he always sought.  He had a natural talent for drawing as well as playing instruments by ear.  He was a ladies man and considered charming to women who didn't know him.  He was also a scared and insecure man child afraid of ever forgiving himself.  Ultimately his inability to forgive his faults has lead to his demise.  Just like most chasing the dragon, he loved and hated the beast within.  The torment was evident in his eyes.\nE would tell you or anyone to leave that H behind.  He may have used the emotions of others to his advantage but he truly never wished his pain on someone else.  He just hoped that if he ever caught the dragon then his pain would disappear. I wonder how I could have offered more help without continuing to provide the resources he needed to keep playing his game of chess.\n\nEdit: Grammar and spelling \n\nEdit II: After speaking with E's Baby Momma, I learned some bittersweet news.  Although Es FB began reading like a goodbye in some of the last few posts but the final 2 were about getting help. E reached out to his BM and told her that he ran into my hubby and my father in law within 2 days of one another.   My father in law has a generous soul and told E if he gets himself back together that maybe he could return to work with the team.  He gave E a little bit of Cash and told him to keep his head up.  The following evening my hubby also ran into E.  Somehow they got to talking and my hubby told E that he truly didn't want anything bad for him.  He stated he was hurt that E couldn't just be honest.  My husband's rule was to always be honest and I will find a way to help you. But, if ya lie and I find out...well, its gonna be time to go.  Hubby actually caught  E in multiple lies and always talked the lie out.  Hubby would 1st get E to acknowledge the lie and why there was no need to do it.   Hubby just couldn't understand why he didn't feel E could not trust hubby to help him.  E only stated it was due to shame.  Hubby won't admit this but I truly believe it was because E had not seen a future in which he could live sober.  Anyway, my hubby told him that he forgave him and all he wanted was to help.  E attempted to refer to Hubby as brother but my Hubby informed him they were no longer brothers.  The last words my hubby said to E,  keep your head up because I'm still rooting for you.", "author": "sweetnstuff", "score": 56, "flair": "In memoriam", "created": 1597081206.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/i71snv/he_crossed_a_boundary_and_we_followed_the_right/", "num_comments": 10, "title": "He crossed a boundary and we followed the right steps to kick him out.

I really wish it was. I take nine 000 capsules (which is over 2 tbs) 3-5 times a day. I get about 3 hours of relief from each dose. I don't want to increase my dose anymore and I already take 3 capsules of turmeric with each dose and rotate strains and vendors (all of them are top notch) to potentate it and keep my tolerance down. It only gives me enough relief to get and keep me out of bed. If I run errands or want to go out with friends (if I am even able to) I need something more. If I go out with friends for an evening I am stuck in bed for at least a full day recovering. I am not able to shower every day, and I am very limited in the time I feel good enough to do any form of cleaning or self care, even the very basics. I have a really hard time traveling because it increases my pain, and I absolutely love to travel. For instance, I live in Las Vegas and drove to LA and stayed for 5 days. The pain from that trip made me unable to travel and fly to Sacramento to spend Christmas with my family. Also, I am always worse in the Winter.  And, I continue to progressively getting worse. \n\nI have 4 specialists, in addition to my primary care doctor, that I see consistently and trying figure out what is causing all my pain and fatigue. I have also been seen at USC and have been referred to some other departments there, but no one has been able to figure out a real diagnosis yet. There are some suspicions that it is a Neurological disorder, but in the meantime I am just trying to not spend most of my time in bed and have somewhat of a normal life.\n\nI take a ton of supplements, have gone to physical therapy once a week for over 3 years, and I am continue to try everything that is more holistic to give me any sort of relief. The Hydrocodone doesn't work for more than an hour for me, and I don't want to increase my dose again. I have also tried Percocet, it made me so loopy, and didn't give me any real relief.

I\u2019m 2 years sober from everything besides weed and subs. Maybe six months ago I started having bad cravings again and then found my stash of subs, and honestly it\u2019s so much better than taking them everyday for me, because I really don\u2019t have cravings that often and since I don\u2019t take them everyday I never get withdrawals, so I don\u2019t feel dependent on them, and I never build up a tolerance so every time I take one it actually gives me a very satisfying buzz which eliminates the cravings I way more effectively.
