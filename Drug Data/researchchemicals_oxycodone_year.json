The entity said none of this matters anyway and you will forget everything when you go back to Earth. After that, the nitrous wore off and it had only been about 30 seconds since I first took the nitrous. It felt like I spent a thousand years listening to this entity and was so disappointed that I couldn't remember the story of the Universe when I came back to Earth. All I  can remember is exactly what I wrote in this comment but it was still a very enlightening experience. I've tried MDMA and nitrous a few other times and it has given me more answers about the universe than any other drug I've tried. I felt like I was a thought and an object at the same time, like I was transforming between energy and matter. This is something everyone should try, nitrous is very safe too.

I kept getting my mind blown every time I took the no2, kept saying I figured everything out and it turned into a joke in the end because after every hit I took, I would remember that I was going to forget everything and then I realised I kept forgetting everything because the information I was receiving was meant to be kept a secret as I was unable to speak out loud the ideas I was getting. Eventually I managed to pull some information out, writing down things as well but I don't know if I remembered this 'secret'. I figured out that I was merely a thought travelling through still frames of reality and that time was created by travelling through these still frames one by one like a digital video. It looks like a lag effect. Every frame of reality exists at once in the Universe; past, present and future. The Universe is like a finshed film and time is the illusion of movement created by travelling through these still frames of the film one by one, from start to finish. I also figured out that our conscious is nothing but a chain of thoughts and memories, a chain of moments of reality. Every thought connects with a unique reality or dimension. Our thoughts mirrors our environment and we are moulded by the thoughts and moments we remember. We can change who we are by changing our thoughts and memories. I had contradictory thoughts all the time too. I remember being a thought and the environment at the same time, kinda like the quantum cat theory, I felt like I was alive and dead at the same time as well. I eventually realised that everything in the Universe exists on a spectrum and that the world isn't black or white. We are a mix of two opposites which means I could be 90% alive and 10% dead and that makes me healthy and energetic or I could be 60% alive and 40% dead which makes me sick and have no energy. Gender is mixed too and defined by masculine and feminine energies. I could be 80% masculine and 20% feminine which makes me a man or I could be 45% masculine and 55% feminine which makes me a tomboy. 90% feminine and 10% masculine would likely make me a girly girl. We are all a mix of light and dark energy, good and bad, yin and yang. The spectrum theory really helps me understand why the world works the way it does. One other thing I remember as well is that I felt like I had no control over the thoughts I was having, it felt like my mind was mirroring the environment and it was the environment that was in control of my thoughts. For example, if I wanted to take another hit of the No2, it was the energy of the No2 itself that gave me the thoughts to huff it. If I wanted to eat a burger for dinner, it was the collective energy of the burger that gave me the thoughts to want to eat one. It's like all matter has a purpose and we get thoughts based on the environments energy and purpose. This has led me to start to believing that everything in the Universe is consciousness and I'm now experimenting with the idea that the conscious environment controls the everyday thoughts that you have. MDMA and No2 together is truly a powerful experience and I've always had mind blowing trips every time. Who knows what I'll find out next, what do you think of the information I got out of this mix?\nI've never had experiences this mind blowing before.", "replies": {"fiyec40": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/f9f7hs/my_research_chemical_and_drug_review_compilation/fiyec40/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1582866568.0, "body": "Consciousness is energy and the universe is an ocean of energy.

Sorry for format, on mobile. \nFirst, I have to clarify a couple of things. Im currently on Suboxone 8/2 dosage and I stopped taking it 24 hrs before my research. I also got this for pain relief only and not for pleasure, even though this might not seem believable, it's truly the only reason I got it.\n    So I have chronic pain and have been on some sort of pain meds for over 9 years, so I've had them all, and this RC to me reminds me of Oxycodone, alot. Even though im not chasing the feels, it responded almost identical to it in my research. \n    It's caustic, I personally wouldn't take it any other way than oral. I had capsules and they worked alright, but I ended up just tossing and washing since it didn't seem to work as well. \n    As other researchers have stated, it doesn't have any legs really, about an hour for me. And if you have any tolerance at all over moderate, you'll go through it relatively soon. I ended up going through a gram in 6 day's. That's not to say that it's weak, and as always you should be extremely careful with it and have some sort of recovery method with you while taking these RC's! Always practice harm reduction!\n    So I would estimate that I was dosing 125-175mg a day over the course of 5-7 doses. This is with someone a high to very high tolerance, so be careful!

A modification of the structure is unlikely to dramatically change the saftey profile. All of the harms of fentanyl can be mitigited with proper saftey procedures. Anyone remeber AH-7921? How about MT-45? These chemicals are so far away from any known opiod that the saftey profile cannot accuratly be predicited. The chemical itself could be toxic or cause seizures. Users of these two substances reported some very concering side effects such as hearing problems and hair loss. As well as dysporia, cauaticisty and hallucinations. Most likely due to kappa antagoism but the binding profile remains complely unknown. Now we have 2map and ap-238 which are an improvment on mt-45 for sure and they have seen clinical use. But for anyone who is tolerant / dependant these chems are of little use. The dose required is in the 100s of miligrams and for the price its just not economical. They serve ok for the opiod naive but even then O-DSMT is far superior. Its saftey profile is well established and potency is on par with morphine. I know that it is likely going to be gone from the market soon and 2map and friends are a reasonable replacement for the opiod naive market. Its unfouratant that the options are either insanly potent such as fentanyl and the nitazene compounds. Despite the extreme potency these compounds lack the euphoria that heroin, oxy, and others have. The short duration and heavy sedation are undesiriable as well. Then on the other side we have compounds like 2map, ap238 and odsmt that are generally good compounds for the opiod naive. They are essentially useless for the fentalog consumers and fentalogs are far too risky for the naive. So until the market gives us a compound that works for both of these groups eg oxycodone fentalouges and etonitaze based compounds will continue to be the best option for depentant users. The closest we ever got to this was u47700. The potency was not to weak and not to strong.

A quick search here on Reddit will render hundreds of posts discouraging use and telling tales of the horrid withdrawal but after reading so much about it I had to try it out for myself and to be completely honest I am pretty amazed. \n\nDOSE: 150mg of Tianeptine sodium Orally, dissolved in water (no opioid tolerance) \n\nNOTE: Tianeptine tastes horrendous, possibly the most bitter thing I have ever consumed \n\n\\--REPORT--\n\n0:10 - Feel a slight relaxation hitting me, placebo? Not sure at this point.\n\n0:15 - Suddenly feel a strong opioid effect coming over me, I'm begging to zone out looking at my screen and a strong sensation of warmth is spreading from head to toe.\n\n0:30 - Wow the rush was incredible, I have gone from completely sober to extremely high within the span of only about 20 minutes, I feel a strong \"stoned\" sensation in my head and have all of the classic opioid effects that one would expect from a strong opiate narcotic like oxycodone or hydrocodone (If not even stronger looking back). However the sedation aspect isn't quite there, I do feel spaced out and heavy-eyed, however I have been unable to catch a nod thus far.\n\n1:00 - After my previous entry I got in bed for the next half hour. Although still feel extremely \"opiate high\" and have now nodded off a few times the Euphoria is begging to fade. \n\n1:30 - Effects are still very strong and subtle itching is begging to set in. Although I feel incredibly sedated and disconnected from my body I haven't been able to nod as much as I normally would off other classic opiates. My body almost feels as if its sinking into my bed, really nice actually.\n\n2:00 - I'm begging to return to baseline. Although I still feel some pretty decent opioid effects I'm definitely past the peak and am actually starting to nod a little harder then before, possibly because the other non-opioid aspects of the drug are wearing off? The euphoria is pretty much gone however yet physically, I still feel amazing. \n\n3:30 - The effects are almost gone now. I still have a lingering opioid sensation through out my body but I am no longer nodding and mentally I feel very tired and still slightly spacey but almost baseline other then that.\n\n5:00 Effects are totally gone, although I barely still feel a slight comfort through out my body, mentally I am completely sober and ready to go to sleep.\n\nConclusion: \n\nWow for a legal RC this is amazing. Its by far the best legal opioid I have ever tried and kicks kratom's ass if you want a classic full agonist high. Its definitely not as \"clean\" feeling as morphine/fentanyl derived opiates but its damn close. For me It felt like a mix between tramadol and oxycodone, leaning far more towards oxy if not being even stronger in some aspects. Although the peak and overall duration is short It has an incredible rush and feels no different then a strong narcotic I would expect to be given by a doctor. \n\nHowever despite my praise this drug is not all good, as I'm sure many of you know it has awful withdrawals and due to its short duration is incredibly fiendish. This is mostly because although the bodily opiate effects linger about as long as oxycodone the euphoria fades rapidly within less then 2 hours and possibly shorter as tolerance builds. \n\nIn conclusion tianeptine sodium provides a slightly dirtier and shorter but arguably stronger oxycodone like high. It feels no different from a classic opioid and I believe the potential for abuse is no less. If you can see yourself having problems with opiate use or have been dependent in the past stay far away from this drug because although the high is good it will smash all classic opioids in terms of withdrawal and tolerance.

Since it's a tricyclic anti depressant it works on multiple systems, only one of which is the mu opioid receptors. Normal prescribed doses are 12.5 mg 3x daily, so recreational doses are roughly 10 times a singular dose. The issue with that is that a lot of the other mechanisms (serotonin reuptake enhancement, glutamatergic system downregulation) do not scale in the same way as the opioid effects.\n\nThis means that to get the desired opioid effects, people have to take massive doses that end up raising tolerance/activating other pathways really quickly and aggressively. This means that while normal withdrawal from opiates can be uncomfortable, withdrawal from tianeptine is like withdrawing from an opiate, an antidepressant, and a benzodiazepine/tranquilizer all at the same time, and after a shorter period of use than a typical opioid. It would be especially strong because of the doses being 10x+ the therapeutic effect as well, meaning someone unlucky enough to kick a tianeptine habit will be in for:\n\nrunny nose, achy bones, no energy, hot/cold flashes, stomach cramps/explosive diarrhea, increased pain sensitivity, extreme restless leg syndrome, extreme feelings of sadness/depression/hopelessness, akathisia, extreme anxiety.\n\nPeople should be able to choose what they do/put in their bodies, as long as it doesn't harm others. Drug education/awareness and freedom are extremely important and hopefully attainable in our lifetimes.  That said, this is a very powerful drug intended to be used in small amounts that works on a lot of systems in a not very targeted way. Consider this: if you enjoy it, will you not want to do it more? If that is the case, those withdrawals are a very probable future outcome.

Generally nootropics are supposed to be cognitive/life enhancing without being in the same category as drugs that get you \"high\" (which is why phenibut has a lot of warnings around it on nootropics posts currently).\n\nIt's a weird situation because there are no firm categorizations, it ends up coming down to perception. Things that are perceived as cognitive enhancing/making people more productive/healthier/happier/not associated with typical drug abuse behaviors = nootropic, anything where the verbage/associations change to be more like traditional drugs the community tends to shun. \n\nFor that reason people are generally more accepting of the Sulfate form of Tianeptine as a nootropic because it has a very long duration of action, very little peak, maintains a lot of the mood lifting/cognition enhancing/anxiolytic effects without more extreme euphoria, and doesn't facilitate compulsive redosing.", "replies": {"g4i039y": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/iomc05/tianeptine_review_and_experience_report_sodium/g4i039y/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1599640986.0, "body": "Thanks for that info and clarify that!

I haven\u2019t seen many posts on this RC so i thought I\u2019d contribute. The 237 is great! I take about 50mg or so and i get a very nice buzz, head and body. I\u2019ve never found an opioid so similar to oxy, about 50mg of the 2 methyl ap 237 is about the same as a 30mg instant release oxycodone, something i wasn\u2019t expecting. My ROA if choice is oral, however i have insufflated (burned like hell) and plugged (also burned), both worked, but the best effects came from oral and lasted the longest. \nI\u2019ve heard some people have horrible side effects from this RC, such as stomachs pains, loss of memory, WDs that last months etc. but i haven\u2019t had any negative side effects and i stopped taking it a few days ago. I started taking 10mg just to make sure it didn\u2019t kill me, and when i deemed it safe i decided to titrate my dose upwards.
