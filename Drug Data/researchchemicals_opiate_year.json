{"ebvix7": {"text": "Clonazolam and high potency rc benzos are fucking evil. I've been clean for months and I still keep hearing about the ways in which I behaved like an insufferable asshole. This stuff is not like etizolam or other benzos, just stronger as I thought. It changes your fucking personality. Im missing about three months. I'm so lucky to have a supportive family that has forgiven me and I'm doing a lot better. I really hope someone reads this and decides against buying clonazolam. It's not just a cheaper alternative to benzos. Other benzos are bad enough but this high potency shit is terrible. If there's any interest I can type out all the wild shit I got up to. I ended up in the hospital with kidney failure, seven substances in my body, a full ten days missing and months of fuzzy memory. I was supposed to go to Amsterdam but instead I ended up in some tiny weird German city. Couldn't walk and was totally out of it and psychotic for a few days. Fucked up.\n\n\nEdit: Im adding a description of how I used this substance because multiple people have asked. \n\nI ordered powders and compounded my own solution with EP propylene Glycol. My first solution was somewhere on the order of 1mg/ml. I was already on etizolam at about 5 mg a day sometimes more. I started off with less than one mg. I still remember about a month of daily use without much problems. The thing is that being constantly under the influence disinhibited me and made me use unsafe doses. So basically, using it 'safely' can lead to using it unsafely because you're not in your right mind. Withdrawal the amounts you mentioned you'll probably be fine. The real problems come wen you have hundreds of mg of powder or solution. I ended up ordering more and more and making stronger and stronger solutions. I put this down to tolerance which it probably was at first but ramping it up like that made me ramp it up even more disproportionately to tolerance. This benzo just kills insight.\n\n\nMost importantly, I am not in any way shifting responsibility. Everyone is responsible for their own actions regardless of what they are on. Doing something dangerous with a dangerous tool doesn't make it not your fault, but it doesn't make the tool any less dangerous. Ostensibly one could use a nuclear bomb safely. But it is still not worth it. There are so many alternatives and absolutely no reason to use this over them.\nSecond edit:\nWhat I describe as addiction to etizolam is often described by others as medical use for anxiety. I never went over two milligrams of etizolam for almost a year. I was 'only' at five when I went onto clonazolam. I never wanted to get high from any of these medications, just relief from anxiety. I really don't find benzos fun, however the relief is obviously enjoyable. However this is a very bad way to relieve your anxiety. I never did any of these drugs for fun. About three years ago I was prescribed oxy for anxiety after benzos and antidepressants didn't work. This is done very rarely in some European countries. It's even been done in the US before in a different time. The doctor taking care of me though was just a GP that was a little too sure of himself and I ended up on such a large dose it wasn't sustainable. I went onto methadone and back onto benzos. All of my use is what many here describe as medical. That doesn't mean it's not addiction nor that it helps anyone in the long-term. Anyone who thinks they can use benzos for anxiety every day, even if their dose never goes up, you are likely in for a rude awakening. While more people manage to do it than with opiates, it's still incredibly rare for that to work out and you'll always be dependent on the medication. most people on the same dose for years get absolutely no benefit and are just scared of getting off again. I've been through the gamot of likely around 30 psychologists and psychiatrists, and study psychology myself. Of them only one has had patients who do this, two in fact. It's not a desirable position and will make your problems worse in the long run. Infrequent panic attacks and phobia situations are where these medications are useful.", "author": "LSDkiller", "score": 201, "flair": null, "created": 1576616509.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/ebvix7/clonazolam_is_the_devil/", "num_comments": 295, "title": "Clonazolam is the devil", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fb7iwuo": {"score": 88, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ebvix7/clonazolam_is_the_devil/fb7iwuo/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1576620184.0, "body": ">  I was supposed to go to Amsterdam but instead I ended up in some tiny weird German city\n\ntell me about that part", "replies": {"fb7moy1": {"score": 48, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ebvix7/clonazolam_is_the_devil/fb7moy1/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1576623119.0, "body": "I will, I'll type it out a bit later when I get to the computer", "replies": {"fb88958": {"score": 26, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ebvix7/clonazolam_is_the_devil/fb88958/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1576637094.0, "body": "tiny german cities are pretty cool though", "replies": {"fb8936p": {"score": 20, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ebvix7/clonazolam_is_the_devil/fb8936p/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1576637610.0, "body": "Kreilsheim tell you anything?", "replies": {"fb8d0ol": {"score": 23, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ebvix7/clonazolam_is_the_devil/fb8d0ol/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1576640053.0, "body": "South germany instead of Amsterdam?

My first solution was somewhere on the order of 1mg/ml. I still remember about a month of daily use without much problems. The thing is that being constantly under the influence disinhibited me and made me use unsafe doses. So basically, using it 'safely' can lead to using it unsafely because you're not in your right mind. Withdrawal the amounts you mentioned you'll probably be fine. The real problems come wen you have hundreds of mg of powder or solution. I ended up ordering more and more and making stronger and stronger solutions. I put this down to tolerance which it probably was at first but ramping it up like that made me ramp it up even more disproportionately to tolerance. This benzo just kills insight. \n\nI think you'll be fine with those small amounts, just start low, go slow, and order other benzos when you're done. And should you ever get dependent on benzos use something else. This benzo is especially unsuited for daily use in a way that is not true of other benzos.\n\nEdit:\nTo say something about your use. Two things. If a psychiatrist deems the use of benzos necessary in your case you should get a prescription for a differently compounded benzo to take to a compounding pharmacy. Allergies should not be a reason for you not to get the medications you need. And about using benzos for anxiety in general. While there is a small minority of people who occasionally have panic attacks, like every couple of weeks, that then take a benzo and get better and don't need it for a while, that is not the norm. The norm is people taking it often for a general or oft occuring anxious state. All to often this ends in daily dependency. Now being dependent on benzos is something that people can sustain for AGES. I did just fine on etizolam. But that doesn't mean you're not worse off. I don't know your specific case but if you're dosing every day, then you are no different to me when I started off. The daily use of benzos for anxiety to me is dependence just like I had it. I don't see much medical value in it. When I say I was dependent on benzos that's what I mean.

Even the couple of people in this thread who disagree with me on the dangers of this drug say it should be used very sparingly. This is true for any benzo. You can't use it every day without getting dependent. I really do understand not wanting to live and feeling like you might as well take drugs because it's better than suicide but you will make your lot in life worse. If you really need to be on benzos like that go to the doctor. Your allergies are no problem. They can make pills or capsules that you won't be allergic to. trying to treat health problems with chemicals on the internet never works. Also, benzos exhibit cross tolerance meaning using clonazolam or another benzo won't help at all with not developing tolerance. In fact tolerance to clonazolam develops way more rapidly than etizolam which is known to be one of the less bad ones when it comes to tolerance. I know you likely won't listen to me but even if you don't PLEASE don't try to mix a powder. This will not work at all.

So to find Etizolam blotters, which I can take without suffering any noticeable adverse effects has been heavenly.\nThanks so much for your thoughts my friend I will think it's all over and take it firmly on board.", "replies": {}}}}}}}}}}, "fba6v9j": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ebvix7/clonazolam_is_the_devil/fba6v9j/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1576696426.0, "body": "Where in germany do you were", "replies": {"fba9f75": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ebvix7/clonazolam_is_the_devil/fba9f75/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1576699669.0, "body": "Kreilsheim", "replies": {}}}}, "fbbp6w2": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/ebvix7/clonazolam_is_the_devil/fbbp6w2/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1576733908.0, "body": "when I blacked out on clonazolam I deep cleaned the kitchen.

And no one wants to help cause they don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll quit. Plus I didn\u2019t wanna live in a shit place for 3 months again anyways.. so I tried suboxone, didn\u2019t work, still had withdrawals and diarrhea and was just terrible... someone recommended methadone. Was on 80mg and slowly tapering off (now am at 30mg) in 3 months or so I\u2019ll be totally clean off this shit hopefully. \n\nHardest part is staying away from all triggers and anyone that uses. Don\u2019t go to places you know you\u2019ll end up using or buying again, ever!!! And most importantly make up your mind to quit for good and stay clean and don\u2019t go back no matter how much your brain manipulates you. Many say it\u2019s a disease but I think even though it partly may be, the real disease is your brain is plagued with a manipulative cell/thing that just lies to you to use \u201conce\u201d or \u201cjust one more time\u201d and that once or one more time ALWAYS will lead to relapse.. once a week then every other day then every day and then every day every hour/or once every couple to few hours... until you\u2019re broke and lose everything you worked for. Money and trust wise too. It\u2019s a shit life. Your family doesn\u2019t even want to have anything to do with you so why would other people? It\u2019s sad and a bad way to live. Wish you all the best. Just gotta stay strong and not give up. Compare it to when u want to lose weight And want to begin exercising, but instead this is losing that manipulative brain thought-process and it\u2019s exercise for the brain. \n\nWhen you\u2019re serious about exercise and health, you Don\u2019t want to give in to those \u201csugar cravings\u201d .. Well, in opiates addiction case we never want to give in to \u201cbrown-sugar cravings\u201d instead of the regular sugar you avoid when serious about exercising and losing weight.. not sure if that analogy made sense (brown-sugar being a slang term for heroin, and I\u2019ve done all. Black tar and middle eastern powders and white China too).. it\u2019s tempting to use \u201cjust one last time\u201d regardless though, you have to make up your mind and learn from your past mistakes if you wish to grow and overcome this bad habit for life. Yes, it\u2019s true that relapse is part of recovery, however, not many will keep putting up with 4+ relapses; especially when they\u2019ve seen you can quit since others (or you yourself) have done it before successfully.  You have to decide what you really want out of life; an easy (yet pathetic outcome hard life) way out of pain by \u201cnumbing the pain\u201d or to face all the pain and hardships face on and overcome them no matter how hard times may get. And picking up better new hobbies you enjoy and staying busy always helps a lot!! During recovery good healthy relationships, some exercise (few months after being clean), protein, comedy, and music help when you\u2019re tapering off this junk. Stay strong and don\u2019t give up, times will get better if you truly want them to! I believe in you and know you can do it if you really want to, believe it!\n\nTL;DR - don\u2019t be lazy!

Anyways I\u2019m rambling on like him now lol.. but my point was I\u2019ve heard about kratom but I didn\u2019t want to replace one substance (even though I know it isn\u2019t as bad) for another, with methadone I plan to taper off completely in 3 months. If you\u2019re doing the same thing with kratom and taper off for good, well hey more power to you brother!\n\nCause you prove a great point I forgot to make: there\u2019s a few ways to kick this habit; not just one answer. If you really want to, you will find what works best for you. For some it\u2019s methadone. For some it\u2019s suboxone (those who don\u2019t inject and just smoked have lower withdrawal pains so suboxone or subutex can be enough). For some methadone, for some even ibogaine helped a lot! That\u2019s an interesting one (ibogaine). And some I\u2019ve seen get clean the hard way: cold turkey cause they couldn\u2019t either afford help or didn\u2019t know any other way. So my point agrees with yours exactly, many ways to do it, you just have to make up your mind and have the will-power/determination to be serious enough about recovery!!\n\nThanks again for sharing, and wish you Stay clean for life bro! Well done so far hope we keep up the good work. \ud83e\udd1e \ud83c\udf40 \ud83c\udf44\ud83e\udd0d\ud83d\udc7d", "replies": {"g7chc2c": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/j2wdw7/what_are_your_lives_likereally/g7chc2c/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1601625726.0, "body": "I totally agree that everyone must take their own path at their own pace.

Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night.

I experienced many things during this trip, among them I presented myself with the issues I was unhappy with in life, I was really able to come to peace with all of them. I stopped blaming others for my drinking and obesity. I decided it was time to make a permanent change in my life.

Late last year I discovered the research scene and it has had a tremendous impact on my life.\n\nI feel I am a fairly responsible person. I work a fulltime retail job, I have two kids and a fiance. My drugs of choice are refer and psychedelics. I partake in tripping every 2-3 weeks or so. I take stims sometimes 2-3 times a week, and I have had issues with sleeping for years, so when I need a really good nights rest I'll also take clonazolam, I try to limit this to 2x a week. Every so often I will research other psychedelics.\n\nThese drugs make me extremely happy, and I made a deal with myself, that as long as I can maintain a healthy lifestyle, then I can allow myself to partake in this research. I know that's kind of silly, but it has been working for me, and I am truly the happiest I have been in a very long time.\n\nI am thankful for this board, I have learned so much, and the stories I have read (some good, some extremely terrifying) has helped to keep me in check.

Not just for the RC related stuff but socially, to get to know the people we chat with and can the most honest with (probably)... thanks for writing this and sharing!\n\nIf it interests any...\n\nThe short story is: \nWidowed at 36, shitty abusive therapy from a psychologist plunged me into severe suicidal depression, to the point where I started looking for ways to knock myself out or numb myself for days. Learning curve (crypto) was high due to the high dysfunction of daily life from severe depression but I mamaged to get a handful of candy.\n\nThe Candy:\nUps and downs mostly. Didn\u2019t think I could pull it off more than once so got a good amount, all legal, but grey area seized one package (fck it was 2-map).\n\nMy life:\nSevere depression, social isolation, I could go out while on stuff so long as I could physically make it out the door, mostly grocery store and coffee shops and MacD\u2019s during the heat wave (1$ drinks all sizees). Didn\u2019t feel so \u201cout of place at MacD\u2019s compared to Starbucks but at SB I used my phone app, didn\u2019t have to say a word, they knew me and my ordet...\n\nWell life is different now. I stopped going to the grocery store for the first 5 months of the pandemic... but will now only go if high on uppers (don\u2019t affect me as much as RC OPs... ), and avoid going anywhere public (indoors) because my city is dumb and on the highest alert possible (very restricted as of TODAY).\n\nSo my livingroom is sorta my \u201cworkout area\u201d / damce floor... dizziness from RCs is my main enemy, but dance (skating but ... pandemic..) is my creative outlet.\n\nNo one but my psych knows about my consumption. I see him once or twice a week for therapy and meds. I\u2019m on buproprion, already somewhat of a stim but have such a high tolerance, other stims don\u2019t do much so I dabble in RC OPs to counter the effect to sleep days off.\n\nNone of my friends know (I think...????) because I\u2019m highly functional on drugs. I\u2019m highly DYSFUNCTIONAL and go MIA for a week or so when severely depressed and NOT on RCs... \n\nI\u2019m fairly athletic and nothing I take affects my performance (strange). I do an hour of intense cardio (sprints, jog) and an hour walk daily so maybe that sweats out the drugs. My liver is already highly functional, it gets rid of toxins real fast so I have a high natural tolerance so huge phrma benzo script. Haven\u2019t tried RC benzos because I have so much pharma but looking for 2fma, seems to work best during a major crisis when I\u2019m likely to get impulsive and self harm or worse...\n\nAnyone else in the RC closet?", "replies": {"g7nozeo": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/j2wdw7/what_are_your_lives_likereally/g7nozeo/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1601835359.0, "body": "I think most people are in the RC closet, since it's hard to explain to outsiders.

Personally I have never liked the high as you say, I call it rather a down and, if I have two prescriptions, it is only voluntary, for very specific situations, the descent style of the most powerful stimulants, by good coke which, I recall, can not be stressful or agonizing, unless you go there like crazy , or methylphenidate, and most non-pyros RCs, non Beta Ketone, substituted cathinones or all these compounds made to be adrenaline and dopamine nags and that for the stronger I find it difficult to bear their IV intake !!! Here is their unique interest and utility for most of us and I think spoke at a national level.

I have first begun with snorting hot rails, and know above all that anyone who takes this drug and feels anxious, stressed or so strongly stimulated that he is the victim of a heavy bodyload can be sure not to have taken real pure cocaine, or even coke at 60% because any intake of good cocaine in adequate quantity can only feel a huge well-being , too short a wave of pleasure accompanied by stimulation of the more manageable and pleasant, the opposite effect of a pvp or an MDPV once the rush of pleasure passed. And absolutely no hard comedown, very manageable though!!! But this f..... craving which is in his own very hard to say stop, worse part of the drug. \nAll this to say that, first of all, coke is always very nice and whether it is in rails or IV there is never a bad trip to the key !!! Those who feel anguish or evil have never taken real fiendish cocaine!!!\nWhen I read that amphetamines are more euphoric, I know that the person who says that has no idea what real coke is. \nThen, only those injecting it are able to feel its most interesting and intense property, the FLASH, RUSH... whatever the word, a discharge of pleasure so strong and so good that as someone above said, we could never stop and this until our bank account is empty and again, it is able to make you do things that your deep nature would normally have refused you to do in your normal state!!! \n\nFinally, the only drug that can compete with her is D-methamphetamine, when I was in the business of meth, I only touched and gave the delivery man for a friend network boss and it was delivered to 96% but the dealers to whom I was supposed to deliver it did not touch the same because before anything, I had to give it to the cutting specialist, who with a kg made 7 and personally I could have the original at only 6500 euros/kg which explains what you you need to know about this... \nThe intravenous D-Meth is a bit compatible with the flash of coke, I said a little, since their rushes are still very different, but something is similar but, just for the explanation. That is, between an intense 30-second flash and another of about an hour and a half, only with the best D-Meth(and don't think it's Mexico that's the best at doing it, in my case my boss had learned from the legendary Hive, and from old bees who taught him the best. But it was a long time ago that he was initiated !!!) \nYou certainly would have quickly understood the difference and made your choice.

I agree, they aren't exactly euphoric, but you can definitely feel good and happy with living life when these intense experiences are something a person deals with very very often. Similar to how dissociative anesthetics just completely calm the outside world so one can reflect internally, benzos are similar as they allow one to go about day to day life without psychedelia that dissos bring, and really help with hard times in life. Most people use benzos because they allow them to be themselves once again and have less anxiety which stops one from being high on life naturally as a lot of people go through life living that do not experience trauma day to day. Today I use a variety of therapy sources with groups, individual, meditation, yoga, exercise, etc BUT I do have to say it still doesn't help as much as GABA agonists do when dealing with these issues. Essentially Benzodiazepines are the perfect \"self medication\" substances which can in turn lead to the problematic dependence and addiction that they bring when one gets carless since dose per dose benzos are so cheap.

I\u2019ve been clean from heroin/oxy for a while, and only taking Xanax or any benzo research chemical that I could get my hands on. \n\nI got 400 0.5mg Flubromazolam tablets and went to a McDonalds bathroom to pop them. In the past, I needed at least 20 of these tablets to feel high (my tolerance was absurd). However, I had very recently got out of rehab and had over 30 days clean, so this time I only popped 10 of the pills. \n\nI suppose it was too much. I don\u2019t remember if I took more after that, I just remember waking up in the ICU. They had a huge tube down my throat and a machine breathing for me, and I kept shitting the bed uncontrollably. I was absolutely fucked, I just couldn\u2019t believe it happened to me. I used to mix fentanyl and Xanax together all the time in high doses and never overdosed, but just 5mg of Flubromazolam was enough to make me collapse on the McDonald\u2019s floor and stop breathing. \n\nI used to think that severe respiratory depression only occurred when someone *mixed* benzos with opiates, as opposed to only taking the benzos. I was very wrong. This shit can kill you on its own, and it really doesn\u2019t take that much to do it.\n\nI was in the ICU for several days recovering from the overdose and they had me on suicide watch the whole time because they thought I was trying to kill myself taking all those pills. The cherry on top for all of this was the police finding an unmarked plastic bag with around 390 Flubromazolam tablets in my pocket. I was interviewed by the police briefly about the pills because they had no idea what they were, but luckily they didn\u2019t charge me with anything. I wondered if that was because Flubromazolam is technically legal, or because they saw that I was just a young addict and not a drug dealer.

It's crazy how fast it happens, literally overnight.  I used to stick to the 3 day rule, use for 3, sleep like shit for a night or two, but stay sober or opi free for 3 days, then go back to using for 3.  That lasted maybe a month hahaha!  I knew it was only a matter of time before I had a serious problem on my hand...\n\nI remember when I was introduced to H Halloween night about 17 yrs ago.  At the time, Hydrocodone, Oxy, Xanax, and Soma was the big thing.  I had a pretty decent Hydro and Oxy habit brewing and little did i know that my downstairs neighbors were full blown H addicts.  I was friends with them and they could tell I was pretty high while taking my dog out.  My neighbor told me stop by that night, so about an hour later, I stopped by.  His girl immediately threw my these 2 tiny black baggies that I could barely open.  Out pours this brown powder and I ask, \"Is this H?\"  Then the vinegar smell hits me!  After about 15 minutes of working the courage up, I snort the entire 10 sack.  Within 5 minutes, needless to say I knew it was GAME OVER FOR THIS GUY!  I've done a lot of euphoric drugs growing up, mainly X and Opi's to get the \"feel goods\".  Within 4 months of snorting that first line, I had that same girl start hitting me in the arm because I shook so bad.  She would say, \"give that to me, your veins are beautiful, can't hardly miss\".  The first time to inject was absolute BLISS.  Within 6 months of injecting, I was in the CLINK!  No drug has ever got on top of  me so quickly and then proceeded to allow me to fuck my life up at such a rapid pace  like H did to me.  \n\nNow, I NEVER hit the needle and only snort or smoke any decent quality H that c0mes my way.  Tread lightly my friend.  i know it feels fucking fantastic, but once it has its teeth in you, there's only 1-2 ways out, Cold Turkey and/or Suboxone/Mdone.

Goodtimes lol.  \n       \n Classic Keta - (all forms, sugar, needle shard, racemic and S, etc.) - classic not much to say.  \n\nTiletamine - pure form is available in my country. LOVE THIS SHIT.

Not the fake happiness ephoria of opiates and such but like a psychedelic experience whree i felt emotionally relieved. \n\n1.5 hours  - im peaking, i am at a soulful bliss and yet im reliving past traumas but seeing them through a lense of an outsider. I see all my mistakea, my misfortunes, my whole life reenacted in my mind and i observed it all with pure zen judgement and made peace with so much trauma and my mental state that i literallt cried not out of sadness but pure happiness. I felt so happy and at peace with life it was like no other drug.\n\n3 houra - after the peak im just left in a blissful zen with the occasional revisit to my past or some personal issue or such all with zen and acceptance.\n\n4 hours - im sober and unlike any other drug ive taken except psychs, especially for dissos it wss suprising i didnt have an itch for it. I literally looked at the bag, poured some out, made a line. And i was like. No i dont need this right now, i really have like no feeling or desire to do more, ive never had such self control with a substance. Especially not from being so satsified with the experience that im content after being sober.\n\nI of course finished the rest of the bag but i did so spread out over two weeks.

One night, I took it way too far, which is entirely my fault.  I may be lucky to have woken up, but I also might have damaged my hearing long-term.\nI woke up from being either passed out or blacked out, and I thought I had woken up in a war zone.  The room was spinning and shaking, I was in tremendous pain, disoriented, unable to walk, and my ears rung louder than any noise I'd ever heard.  I literally expected to see splintered wood and a collapsed ceiling because it felt like a grenade or flashbang had gone off.  It sounded like I was deep underwater, I was so deaf I couldn't her my own voice. I could only hear sharp noises, which were severely distorted. I knocked on wood, and it sounded like a chainsaw snapping into glass. And the sound was extremely painful and loud.\nI thought I was dying, and sure that I'd lost my hearing forever.  I tried to get someone to take me to the hospital but I was too disoriented and I passed back out. \nThe next day I woke up in a lot of pain, and my hearing was better, but very damaged. It's been 3 or 4 days now, and my right ear seems pretty much normal, but my left ear still feels like it's underwater. I have a hard time understanding people. My balance is quite off- I always feel like the world is tilted by about 15-20 degrees sideways, and like my body is twisted, as if my torso is at a different angle than my legs, even when I stand straight. I am worried that I did permanent damage to my cochlea, and may not have proper hearing and balance again unless I have surgery. \n\nSo, please be careful with this substance, especially if you have hearing problems or have experienced ototoxicity with any other substances.\n\n**Update: sorry everyone, I quit reddit a few weeks ago because I felt it was a bad influence and consumed too much of my time.  My balance is back to normal, and I think I will recover completely/mostly. I still have a ringing in my left ear, and occasional problems understanding people (although I've always had that problem).  I hope that in another week or so my left ear will have recovered. A scary experience nonetheless!\n\n***Update after reading comments: I have very low blood pressure, so I dont believe that is the culprit, although I was IVing it, so that may have caused a blood clot?  My veins are pretty hard still, and were irritated after I discontinued use.  Thank you to those who commented about their opioid overdoses causing the same issue.  I'm inexperienced with opioids, and believe it likely that I did overdose.  The studies I've been reading report that MOST opiates are ototoxic, and the effects can be permanent with long term, non-overdose use, and more often temporary after an overdose.  I dont have any studies on this chem specifically, but I'd be willing to bet that, like most opiates, it is ototoxic, but that with responsible, short term use, hearing defects are unlikely to occur (which, again, can be said of any opiate).  Just my opinion!

Why did you decide to start IVing a research opioid with no tolerance???\n\nThis whole influx of people that are doing this with these scary RCs is so insane to me.  Even hardcore H users like myself are wary of these RCs.", "replies": {}}}}, "itk2xf": {"text": "Ok, so RC's always were nothing more than obscure compounds, known only to the narrow circle of chemists and MD's who researched in fields of physiology or pharmacology. \n\nRise in the popularity of RC's began with the start of a new millennium I guess. Research chemicals are still obscure, their properties and effects, especially long term ones, are studied to a small degree or not studied at all. Most of the time people don't even know and dont bother to think about what is in their batch of bath salts or \"spice\" or what's layed on the blotter of \"acid\". \n\nBy the way it looks like such carelessness and lack of knowledge is more dangerous relating to RC's in comparison with classical drugs. Real acid don't kill people, unlike new RC analogs and derivatives. Real weed is safe, but RC cannabinoids are not. Shit, even old and known opiates are somewhat safer than new RC opioids especially ones that are fentanyl derived. And plain good ol amph is safer than lots of new RC stims. \n\nWhy RC's became so widespread and popular if they are worse than classic compounds in terms of safety? And RCs are not only deadlier, but in a number of cases they produce worse \"high\" than old drugs.\n\nI have experience with a lot of drugs both regular and newly designed. DOB is worse than LSD (in terms of \"high\" and overall experience, and I tried it more than once or twice), A-PVP or MDPV are worse than old meth (smaller duration, more cravings and compulsivity, far shittier comedowns and narrower therapeutic intervals which means frequent overdoses). Synthetic cannabinoids produce stupid and most of the times not very pleasant condition, feels somehow resembling weed but with a plastic unnatural feeling, retarded jaw-hurting and unpleasant spontaneous laughing sessions sometimes for an half-hour in a row (not a case with the weed) and high potential for dependency and daily binges (unlike weed again). \n\nSo what can we conclude from aforementioned? RC's are overall worse than their well known respected \"founding fathers\". Yes, that's my personal opinion and it's a not always a case, but I mentioned some points to prove myself right. Btw I'd be glad to discuss on this topic if you disagree with my opinion. \n\nWhy RC's became popular then? In my opinion it is caused by the \"war of drugs\" around the globe which has gained momentum in the past few decades. RC's became widely used as an attempt to find a workaround. It was a loophole in drug prohibition laws. Who in his right mind would fuck around with some unknown chinese RC if there are familiar and reliable drugs? No one! (Well, there always were people interested in such stuff but it was a small minority.) And no one bothered indeed, until laws and governmental pressure made dealing with classical drugs too much of a problem for pushers and their clients. \n\nIs \"war on drugs\" effective then? No, they banned old drugs, people started to use new drugs. They banned new drugs, people synthesized a bunch of newer ones. You forbid deals with whatever compound - people will synthesize some derivative totally unknown before. In this chase narcs are always a step behind, they can't forbid every possible psychoactive substance in advance. \n\nGovernments around the world have tried to eradicate drug abuse by repressive methods for decades or maybe hundreds of years. Lets look on ethanol which is a psychoactive drug of abuse as well as every other substance of the sort. For some reason dumbasses still tend to draw an imaginary line between booze and other drugs, i.e. that's fine to have a beer or two in the evening but that's unacceptable to even say aloud something like \"I had some coke yesterday, shit was good\". What an example of Orwellian doublethink. This bullshit mindset someday will cease to exist, I believe.\n\nProhibition laws on alcohol both in USA and USSR has failed to cease alcohol consumption. People drank before, people drink nowadays and they will continue to drink booze in the future. These prohibition attempts only removed legal production from the market, along with huge chunk of tax income and QC (so people drank alcohol made not for human consumption like ethanol-based face lotions, liquids for cleaning windows etc). People didn't gave two shits about that laws and continued to drink, either brewing at home or buying from bootleggers. Even USSR with its notorious repressive state policies and ubiquitous propaganda failed in that 'war on booze'.\n\nSo why governments are still trying to use those ineffective flawed bullshit methods that failed to solve the problem before? With donkey's stubbornness they continue pointless 'war on drugs', even when more progressive countries like Belgium or Czech Rep. show that legalization of drug usage and creating a legal, white, tax-paying and controlled market have much better results both on public health and state budget.\n\nEither governments are composed of utter idiots, total retards that can't put a cube in a square hole and stop this idiotic \"war\". Or our rulers are not stupid and they understand that their actions are fruitless, and the only outcome is that number of people in jails is rising while drug usage remains the same?\n\nI guess it is impossible that everyone who occupies the high seat is retarded. There's simply not enough retards to fill all parliaments around the world. And these guys, presidents and ministers, really don't look like they all have IQ of a potato.\n\nSo they know that their actions will never achieve declared goal. And they are not stupid. And they have live examples of countries that decided to stop putting their citizens behind bars for drugs. These countries are doing good, levels of drug abuse or crime rates became lower after such reforms. In Belgium one can bring his shit to a public lab to be tested. In most countries one can't even publicly mention that he uses drugs, he'll have problems with cops, with his employer at work, his landlord and neighbours.\n\nWhy? I'm not into conspiracy, but this situation looks like some kind of... genocide? You pursue your people, you put them behind bars for years, ruining their lives, you brainwash nation (\"meth not even once\" campaign, yup, but not \"cigarette not even once\") instead of real harm reduction and education. And you do this while knowing that this actions are pointless, so it can't be justified as \"temporary violence for the greater good of people\".\n\nTLDR: don't waste your time reading, im on meth so i spent two hours writing this wall of text not in my native language, i only wanted to reply to someone's comment, but it went too far as you see.

As I mentioned before, this language is not my first so I guess I show more eloquence in the native language which Western people, sadly, don't understand. English is simple, lapidary I'd say, and slightly primitive (or rough?). Some thoughts are easier to express in English due to that properties. But my mother's tongue is much more profound, you can use a bunch of different words to describe something, and when general meaning leaves unchanged there are different tones to these variations, y'know? Also I think that our flexible grammar and free sentence structure adds another layer of expression. And of course our truly modular obscene vocabulary, it's possibilities are almost endless. Unlike English, sadly. Your language is good for some technical articles or for a boring free newspaper with local news and a tv program on the last page.\n\nAlso my eloquence may be linked with the fact that I'm in the 98.6 percentile as that free online IQ test stated.

I said that but only about blacks. And I meant African people of the negroid race. It is true that these people lived in a primitive tribal way in the time I talked about. Actually they had similar very primitive lifestyle and rudimental social structure even in a relatively modern era.\n\nHave you thought about how white colonists were able to capture black slaves in such big numbers, regularly, for decades? I'll tell you, primitive social structure of natives wasn't allow consolidation of tribes into something bigger. Whites exploited this \"fragmentation\" and also ignorance and naivety of the black people. On frequent occasions colonists simply did a bargain with a \"princeling\" or a chief of local tribe. Tribal rulers have sold their people to whites. Any structurized and systemic resistance was impossible due to absence of statehood or any consolidating institutions. Whites frequently used local conflicts between neighboring tribes to own benefits. \n\nAnd you can witness echo of that times even now. Black countries are mostly poor, undeveloped, and in the state of permanent civil war. That fragmented structure with a shitload of different tribes (nations) can be seen even today in Africa, remember secession of the South Sudan, that conflict had roots not only in religious differences. \n\nMajority of developed African black countries started to grow only after white colonization. When white colonists were sent out after a revolution these countries immediately slowed down temps of economical growth and went back to shit. Zimbabwe is a perfect example and proof of my words (also it's a rare case of black country that had at least kind of statehood, decent military power and beyond-national institutions, thanks to the king Shaka). When Zimbabwe was under brits and was called Rhodesia, quality of life, economic indexes and temps of growth were decent, Rhodesia was among the fastest growing countries in the region. Then black people decided that they no longer need bad white invaders, it's time for the independence and shit. After only 20 years without whites Zimbabwe dug itself into shit beyond any limits. Now this country exists only to be the source of memes and jokes, Zimbabwe is generally synonymous to \"fucking shithole\" now.\n\nYou see, bro, can you understand what I'm about now? Negroid people (it's not offensive, just a scientific term) even today live in crap, and reason for this is same as to black slavery. And I don't say that all niggers are stupid ass-naked ooga booga baboons, God forbid. When black people are incorporated into a developed progressive society they can perform great, like N. Degrass Tyson (if i spelled the name right). So no hard feelings, just in case, no offense was meant by me.\n\nSumming it up: people of the African negroid race lived in trees (metaphorically), not \"other races\". And aforementioned people continued to live in trees to the most recent times. And today they are still mostly living in trees (metaphorically again), but now we call it \"slums\" or \"ghettos\", and instead of real trees they started to use chipped bricks, rusty metal sheets, and other garbage.", "replies": {}}}}}}}}, "g5hfj28": {"score": 2, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/itk2xf/rise_of_rcs_and_drugs_prohibition/g5hfj28/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1600301935.0, "body": "What you're saying makes a lot of sense.

That is just plain wrong according to several nembers and I apologize for being so blithe. Please do your own research uf you're looking for a dose equivalent amount of C-LAM to your benzo of choice. \n\nComing up on my 2nd year of an addiction that cost me my beautiful family, a nicely equipped workshop with pretty much every tool imaginable for building motorcycles (Italian bikes, my hobby), landscaping my property, and basic repair work on my families vehicles. Not to mention the $20,000 in my savings account (crazy how fast an addict blows through his or her cash) \n\nTL;DR: I lost everything, including some actual clothes on my back!\n\n*I want to quit. I'm so fucking over this lifestyle*. But it seems most people don't think im *actually* serious about quitting because I can't and won't do it without self medicating. Maybe I'm a coward... The first thing that I feel as the wd begins to take hold is dread. I'm terrified of 6 hours of dope sickness let alone 3 days. As most opioid addicts know, the mental and physical symptoms can only be called hell. Despite the \"experts\" and their; \"oh, its like having the flu\". Nope. It's not. It's a torture rack. Evsry cell in your body is off. Basic bodily functions like your respiratory and digestive systems are haywire. Your actual bone marrow hurts. Your mouth is sticky and dry, eyes and nose running like a sieve. Red hot pokers stabbing your guts, doubling you over, getting out of bed to retch and dry heave every ten minutes isn't an option so you puke in a bucket next to your bed. You may even literally shit the bed. You're in so much physical and emotional pain all you can do is thrash around in bed, gushing with sweat, obsessing over how awful you feel. \n\nTL;DR: Withdrawal is absolute hell.\n\nIf you've gotten this far, thank you for reading. Now plz listen to my plan... Critique it, add to it, ask questions, just please be helpful.\n\nI've decided to order copius amounts of clonozolam and a mild opiate such as kratom to take the edge off.. The \"kick a little at a time\" approach. I do believe I have what it takes to use the kratom responsibly and only if I absolutely can not sleep without it. The clonozolam is the key here tho - I wanna be so zonked out on benzo sedatives that my RLS, mental terrors, all the actual fear is gone. I plan to load up on the kratom plus high doses of C-LAM, and by day number 3 continue the fight with just C-LAM, seroquel, and clonidine. Get myself to the point where I can transition to the pure buprenorphine pills I have stashed away.\n\nSo before I go shopping for RC's... I have about $500 I can spend. Looks like I can get a TON of most rc benzos dirt cheap... $350 for 500 mg of clonozolam, and from whst I read the clonozolam - clonozepam dose conversion is almost equal mg for mg. Are there other benzos I should be considering, maybe something closer to alprazolam that hits harder and faster? \n\nI already know what many of you are thinking - I'm going to trade a massive fent addiction for a deadly benzo addiction. And that will be true... at first. I've kicked enormous kpin and xanax habits before by tapering, and tapering off benzo is nbd to me bc I don't particularly care for them (benzos). They have zero recreational value to me. My last bout was scoring a womens stash of 1mg kpins she was selling - a years stash - 400 1mg blues. Developed a 12-15 mg/day habit. When I noticed my bag was getting low I quickly tapered my 10-15mg habit down to 5-10 within a month, then found a psych who gave me 3mg a day. I was fine. These rc benzos will be strictly for making my wd suck less, but I have no illusions that I'll instantly be fine on 2mg afterwards (assuming I conquer my fent habit). So please, just give me the benefit of the doubt that I'll be able to keep my benzo use under control.\n\nWell then... I have C-LAM as my benzo of choice, kratom as my parachute... Anything else I should add to this cocktail?\n\nPretty sad that I'm doing this much planning and drug shopping to get through what's essentially about 40 hours, long enough to get back on subs. What can I say, I'm a wuss.\n\nSuggestions for alternative benzos and other RC's that may stimulate the opioid receptors would be great. If only *I can just fucking get a little sleep* I think I can conquer this. Being wide fucking awake for 3 agonizing days and knowing $20 worth of dope will end the misery is not an easy thing to do.\n\nThank you all for reading this and for your input. I know this is a bit of a rambling post. With the wide world of RC's we now have at our disposal, there's never been a better time to self medicate...

Because these are all just drugs they would give you there. Except not propranolol. \n\nThey typically prescribe you gabapentin, clonidine, hydroxyzine, and a little bit of valium in my experience. \n\nI would use all of those, and then add some\nOtc meds.

I would never kick without kratom on hand. Some people have had success with Imodium, but I personally wouldn\u2019t use it with the purpose of alleviating withdrawals, it\u2019s also dangerous in high dosages and can induce extremely bad cardiovascular damage when taking high dosages for long periods of time. I do recommend using it for its intended purpose, as an anti-diarrheal at normal doses.   \n\nAssuming you are in the USA, the only meds I\u2019ve listed that would raise a doctor\u2019s eyebrows are Valium and suboxone.

That\u2019s why I listed so many alternatives. Getting into a suboxone program with a licensed physician is somewhat hard and expensive to do, and most psychiatrists aren\u2019t even allowed to give subscripts. You can find a licensed one near you on suboxone.com. \n\nThe quickest, easiest, and least expensive method would be to ask your doctor or psychiatrist to write you the scripts for those 4 detox drugs up above. Or just the first 3 and substitute propranolol for Valium if the doc is uncomfortable with benzos. and be upfront that they are for detoxing off of opioids. I\u2019ve never had a doctor argue or say anything. Then on your own, get the otc meds, supplements, vitamins, and Kratom.

I\u2019ve spend close to if not more than a decade of my life devoted to learning sharing and being one of you. Over the last few years my fun loving experimental life has turned into a dark horrible miserable shell of an existence I\u2019d never want anyone to go through. \n\nI know everything there is to know about every drug on earth, and not a thing matters when you are experiencing true pain and raw emotion that even flubromazolam and Hexen with ap238 and the lot can fix. I have realized I have some major mental health issues that can\u2019t be ignored or numbed by these substances anymore. I\u2019ve been addicted to benzos opiates stimulants cathinones weed spice inhalents and 50 more I can\u2019t remember. \n\nI\u2019m going in less than an hour which is against my decision. I stayed up and did 10g of NEP and Hexen luckily I\u2019m not dependent on 8 drugs at the same time like I was one year ago today (still in treatment). I\u2019ve  never been to inpatient before but this was my ladt resort.  I\u2019m too smart to be admitted. And I believed it.  Being a doctor or pharmacist  doesn\u2019t even compare to the time I\u2019ve put in to devoting my life to this. I did this for us. Me. You, the community. \n\nBut there\u2019s a moment when my mental health loses its marbles and i lose it. Apparently PTSD mental health and depression aren\u2019t just something you can bulldoze through like my old fashioned upbringing has told me. I need compassion. And my life is a fragment of something I wish it would be. I\u2019ve done 200+ different drugs since I was 15- (25now) and ended up abusing anything that took the true pain away. Helping friends and loved ones through addiction that I didn\u2019t understand yet- or my own. I set myself up for failure in life because as long as I knew everything I couldn\u2019t get hurt. \n\nWhat a load of shit. I even know how to get better and can\u2019t on my own.  So I\u2019ve laid the \u201cpipe\u201d down as we call it and I\u2019m getting help from people that think they know more than me.  This will be miserable physically. Knowing I did 10g NEP andHEX in a week. I have all the heavy benzos. I have the anti psychotics. None of it matters. I\u2019m still so miserable everyday and stuck in years past. \n\nPlease take care of your minds as it\u2019s the only true reality you\u2019ll ever know. Cliches are that way for a reason. Don\u2019t be that naive to think you\u2019re an exception. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll see y\u2019all next. But i can\u2019t fucking wait to truly suffer through my mind so I can be the person I\u2019ve always been. \n\nBest of luck rc.  I\u2019ll be back in a while. You\u2019ve given me everything and taken it all. I\u2019m not finished with this rodeo, but i won\u2019t ever get another chance unless I go now. \n\nFairwell and stop doing the fucking ap237/238 and benzos. Legit. Do all the psychos and dissos.

A lot of people I know that use drugs try to associate a *purpose* with using a drug that goes beyond that. For example, my partner enjoys using psychedelics to examine her life or our relationship, to try to see things from a different perspective. She has no interest in something like ketamine because to her it is a sort of neutral wonky high, and it doesn't really force you to experience anything significant the way a strong acid trip does. But to me, I'm super fascinated by pushing the limit to see just how weird things can get in my mind, out of pure curiosity. To her this is not appealing. \n\nAnecdotally, I've just seen that some people just don't like how confusing and weird dissos make them feel, but people like me find it fascinating.

It's not like you drop 300 ug and all of a sudden you see the foolishness of your addictions and magically stop wanting to use. Supposedly ibogaine can be that way, but I don't know personally.

It\u2019s definitely the craziest drug story I have and one of the craziest things that has ever happened to me.\n\nAt the time I was seeing my then long distance girlfriend, we\u2019ll call her M. That weekend M had come to visit me and so I decided to bring her to NYC to check out the Guggenheim museum, for those of you who are familiar. \n\nAt the time I was still relatively new to all of the novel dissos but I was definitely gaining a keen fascination for them and was bent on experiencing them in all different types of settings. I had just gotten a fresh batch of some nice white chinese 3-HO-PCP, as it was getting all the rage as one of the best sedating dissos out there. \n\nThat friday night after I picked her up from the airport, we proceeded to sample some of the new 3-HO to see what it was all about. We took maybe 8mg each but definitely under 10 (i weighed my dose just don\u2019t remember exactly). To be quite honest, I really didn\u2019t get much of an effect from it at all. Everyone on here was saying how potent it is so i was kind of surprised to find this to be the case. \n\nAnyways, considering my experiment the night before was lackluster at best, the next day I decided to bring that baggie along with us as we hopped on the train for the city to see what going to a museum on a low dose of a disso would be like.\n\nWho would have thought that bringing a back of an extremely potent novel disso to a crowded museum could result in any harm? Looking back on it, I may have exhibited a momentary lapse of judgement... \n\nSo we get to the museum and i go into the bathroom first to dose. I dab the very tip of my pinky with the smallest bit of saliva and gently press it into the bag, collecting about a pinheads worth of chemical into my fingertip. I knew how irresponsible that was in retrospect but I chose to ignore how stupid this was in favor of a good time.\n\nNext, it\u2019s my girlfriends turn. I warned her multiple times in the moments leading up to this event that she needs to be very careful about dosing the smallest amount possible. I\u2019m not really sure what happened in that bathroom but about 5 minutes later, as we were walking around she began to get very disoriented to the point where she began to slur in a stuttering voice, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on?\u201d and \u201cwhere are we?\u201d. As soon as I saw this, I knew I had to act. I was very much beginning to feel the effects of this powerful substance more and more as bursts of adrenaline coursed through my body and I quickly began sobering up into the reality that this was about to be a very shitty situation. \n\nI could feel her stiff, cold grasp clenching my shirt tight as I quickly but carefully guided us out of the museum and onto the ledge outside. Her body began to stiffen up as I tried to continue talking to her to keep her somewhat grounded into this reality but I could tell it wouldn\u2019t last long, as her ability to speak quickly dwindled. I\u2019ll never forget this moment because it really exemplified the sheer terror she must have been feeling, but I saw a single tear drop roll down her eye before she completely lost consciousness and I was forced to lay her down on the cold NYC ground because I could no longer keep her lifeless body propped up. \n\nIn NYC, in a place where somebody could be dead in the middle of the sidewalk\nand nobody would bat an eye, an elderly woman approached us and she knew that something was up. She said she was calling an ambulance if i didn\u2019t because \u201ci\u2019m a mother and I wouldn\u2019t want to see my daughter like this.\u201d \n\nThe thing is, I knew deep down inside that she was just SUUPER fucked up and most likely she would be able to ride this out without requiring any real medical attention, but I was still scared shitless no doubt, tossing my baggie of 3-HO into the bushes when no one was looking. I called my close friend to pick us up but there was no way he would get to us before this lady called an ambulance. \n\nNext thing I know, i\u2019m taking my first ride in the back of an ambulance as 2 paramedics began performing their protocol for a suspected drug overdose, thinking she had taken opiates. Little did they know. \n\nIn the hospital, they asked me all sorts of questions, but I most certainly 100% did not admit to having taken any sort of drugs. Looking back on it, this was such a rookie move because it would have saved us thousands on hospital bills if I was just forthright from the start. Anyways, they definitely suspected that she had taken something because they had asked me if I myself ever used drugs but I only admitted to smoking weed. Looking back on it, I\u2019ve gotta say I held my shit together pretty well considering how fucked up I was because I really don\u2019t think they suspected that I was on something other than weed. \n\nBeing that they had no idea why she was passed out, they ran her through the gamut of radiological tests to rule out all possible causes- CT scan, ultrasound, EEG, urine tox etc. but once the drug screen came back positive for PCP, it was clear that all she needed was some\nbed rest and time, and sure enough she slowly came back to earth.\n\nShe was extremely confused at first, with slurred speech to the extreme. She had no idea where she was or what happened after we got to the museum. I couldn\u2019t even say that she holed because she was completely blacked out with no recollection of the events that unfolded before she woke. Complete anesthesia.\n\nThey made me call her dad because the hospital needed to hear from a family member before they could release her. So I called her dad and told him that M Had passed out at the museum and we had to call an ambulance because she wouldn\u2019t wake up. All he wanted was to talk to her so I had to give the phone over to her once she came to. She was clearly fucked up, confused and slurring her speech when they spoke and he\u2019s not dumb by any means but he really didn\u2019t suspect foul play at all so i\u2019m very grateful for that. \n\nShe was very happy to be back but was still so wonked out and acting goofy as fuck. The hospital discharged us after they saw her eat and drink something and take a lap. Before we left, the attending actually approached me and told me that she wishes I had told her that she had taken PCP because it would have made everyone\u2019s lives easier and they can\u2019t get us in trouble for telling the truth in this context. \n\nAfter the hospital the friend who I originally called drove us back to my house where we finished the night off with some some dabs and some much needed relaxation.\n\nI have grown so much from that experience in more was that I was anticipating. It taught me to be so much more careful about how and when I choose to use drugs, and especially who I choose to give drugs to/do drugs with because if something happens to them under my watch,  it becomes my problem. It also taught me to always be honest to medical professionals because they\u2019re just trying to help and won\u2019t get you in trouble, at least not in the US. Also incase anyone is wondering, my girlfriend and I are still together today and currently living together. She eventually forgave me :)\n\nShit was crazy. I always love hearing about people\u2019s wild stories on here, this is one of my favorite subreddits and I feel like it\u2019s time to give back a little and share some of me with all of you. love y\u2019all and be safe.

I just wanted to post this because I think we all walk the line trying to know the difference between use and abuse, and I know for a lot of you drug use is an escape from a harsh reality. This is mostly a copy-paste from a message I left elsewhere:\n\nPeople like to temporarily escape/alter reality/conciousness occassionaly with the normal tryptamines, but with dissociatives a lot of people seem to try to escape reality altogether. Obviously I have a lot of pity for these people. It's honestly depressing to see people escaping their sad realities by doing drugs that cause lasting damage to their brains, minds, bladders, etc. Imo it's a form of self harm, and it hurts to see. \n\nAs a disclaimer, I'm talking about people that abuse dissos [or other substances]. I'm sure plenty of people use them with proper moderation. Also it extends past dissos, but if I'm being honest 9/10 times I see this pattern it's with dissos. Obviously I see a lot of people strung out on benzos/opiates as well, but honestly I think that's more self medication and hubris.\n\nAlso DPH abuse is another example of the same phenomenon (it's a terrible substance and I think the abusers understand this and decide to take it to harm themselves. Definitely physically and likely mentally as well)\n\n\nBut yeah on the topic of use vs abuse, I think something people should start doing is having a spreadsheet where they record their drugs use (dates, times, doses) and have preset rules that push you to avoid overusing,  building tolerances or dependencies, and forgetting to enjoy the sober state of consciousness. Share it with someone who loves and cares about you and will keep you on track. This could be yourself, but like I said, I consider this stuff to be an issue of self harm. It's better if you have someone else who you can share it with, who will advocate for you and keep you accountable. \n\nStay safe and enjoy responsibly.

A few years ago I could not picture even one month into the future and now I have plans and goals for years down the road, that I am actually successfully working towards.

And I have been able to dodge physical dependence for a few years now. (Minus a few month noid binge, which I thankfully was able to quit)\n\nPart of me wonders if I am just fooling myself though, as my track record shows I am unable to use drugs in moderation, it has always devolved into an unmanageable addiction that i need to go to a detox center to break. I'm surrounded by people who proclaim that complete abstinence from all mind altering substances is the only way for someone like me to live a successful life. But I'm not convinced. My usage patterns have changed so much as I've gotten older, and I feel like they will continue to evolve as I build a life for myself and find fulfillment the right way.

You may always struggle with cravings, I still do. I just don't give in to them as much. I do occasionally binge, but only when time allows. It no longer interferes with my life. When I run out of whatever I'm using (mostly dissociatives), I don't buy any more for a few months, no matter how badly I want to. It's not nearly as difficult to abstain as it once was. \n\nSomething has definitely changed in me, it's just easier for me say \"not right now\" that it was when I was in my teens and early 20s. I would say I first noticed this in my mid-20s, and over the next 10 years I was able to go years without anything aside from occasionally using cannabis (which I've stopped using because it kills my motivation, though I do miss it sometimes because it helped with my chronic stomach ailments).\n\nSome people may need to abstain from everything forever. I met people like that in rehab. Doing any drugs or alcohol would send them right back into old behaviors. However, I've also noticed people like that tend to have something else instead of illicit or prescription drugs, whether it's nicotine, or gambling, or endurance sports. I have a friend who is a former cocaine and crack addict who now works as a skydiving instructor. It's certainly safer than crack, but I can see how it's a way for him to get a similar rush. I'm not criticizing that, it's absolutely a better lifestyle choice. \n\nYou may need to find something like that. For me, it's hiking in the forest or on mountains for many miles, until I feel like I can't go any farther, and then I keep going anyway. I often listen to music or a podcast to keep my mind focused on something other than my depressed or anxious thoughts. I like to keep track of that and compete with myself to see if I can go farther and farther every time. It's not as fun as drugs, but it definitely helps with depression, anxiety, and cravings. \n\nGetting out and enjoying nature can be a real mental health booster. The Japanese have a concept, shinrin-yoku, which translates to \"forest bath\". They consider simply being in a forest to experience it, even if you're not doing anything, an important activity for your mental and physical health. There have some studies that show that people, not just Japanese, report better scores on depression and anxiety rating scales after they've been out in nature. I'm not a new-agey/hippie/luddite type person at all. I'm not spiritual, I work in the sciences, and I very much love technology, but I also have come to appreciate that the natural world can be important for mental health. \n\nAnyway, good luck!

Benzos (in moderation, as needed) can be a bitch, but I have anxiety and they totally improve my quality of life. I am not responsive to SSRIs and other antidepressant medications, which is what has lead me here.\n\nFirst I did 6 rounds of IV ketamine infusions that drastically improved my depression (and anxiety, somewhat) almost immediately. But it\u2019s not financially feasible for most people to continue getting ketamine treatments. My doctor charges about $450 a treatment and that\u2019s pretty average from what I\u2019ve heard. Ketamine so far for me has only made me accept and embrace my reality. I also don\u2019t think that escaping reality once in a while is bad either. \n\nMy doctor likes to boast on his website that \u201cmost people\u201d don\u2019t need boosters. I believe most people who have depression thats bad enough, that they\u2019re willing to shell out thousands for ketamine infusions, actually do. Very few people over at /r/therapeuticketamine seem to be fine forever after one initial round of infusions.\n\nSo, while I\u2019m not trying to go down a rabbit hole by any means.. I think giving things like 2fdck a try could be beneficial and more cost & time efficient for me to maintain the positive headspace I\u2019m currently in. I hope that I don\u2019t fall back on my addict ways and \u201cabuse\u201d anything. But I think being aware of myself and my own limits will keep me on the right path.\n\nI like the idea of making a spreadsheet or some what of tracking what we consume (including alcohol and prescription medication) along with journaling moods before taking anything.\n\nObviously you\u2019ve stated that not everyone who uses dissociatives has a problem. I mean, if you\u2019re doing this class of drugs and going to work (or at work) that\u2019s a huge red flag.

They are certainly introspective and give you a new perspective in which you can rethink your life in therapeutic ways. I'd argue that dissos are just as therapeutic and psychedelics if not more.

The major one that is well known is harm to kidneys (mostly a worry for less potent dissos). Others include harm done to spatial awareness, short term memory, and a few others in one study I am having trouble finding. As for addiction, I'd say they're probably in the same realm as stimulants. Of course it varies per person, but I crave my adderall types just as often as my disso types.

The best way I can put it is to imagine you're able to do LSD everyday and redose it. That's the addiction potential of most dissociatives.\n\nTo be clear, I enjoy dissos a lot and use them for both recreation and introspection.

I would do 10-20mg lines at a time, never exceeding 50/60mg per session. The drug itself was very chill, provided a nod that is personally preferable over fentanyl or heroin for me (no opiate addiction history or tolerance ever, just experimentation) The past 3 nights I have stopped using daily and would like to update on my nasal side effects. \n  \nTo begin, my nose would be constantly clogged and full of mucus boogers throughout the day after. Every morning I would blow my nose several times in the shower, producing disgusting looking partially solid mucus with opaque white or yellow color. On the first day of abstinence I decided to do some 2-FDCK again for the first time in several months. It was awesome, and I even unintentionally holed harder than I ever have before! It was great, but I think it made my nose even worse. Since then, whenever I blew my nose one nostril would have blood in the snot but not be continuously bleeding. \n  \nNow, after trying to blow my nose at work and clean up the mucus, it just started bleeding. And whenever I try to blow it gently or sniff too hard it starts bleeding again! Absolutely nuts side effects for not that much general substance going up the nose.

They actually work in a very different area, called the alpha-2-delta-1 subunit of calcium channels in the CNS. I\u2019m copy/pasting from my post below, but...\n\nThe binding to these calcium channels, which are located on the presynaptic neurons, reduces calcium efflux which then ultimately leads to the reduced release of excitatory neurotransmitters into the synapse. This causes you to calm the motherfuck down. GHB acting on GABAb and GHB receptors, this is too inhibitory for your CNS and could likely cause asphyxiation and death, or your heart might stop. So it\u2019s either one or the other. You won\u2019t go into bad withdrawal after only \"4 hours.\" But lemme tell you. Sometimes, when I take enough to black out for 3.5 hours, I would wake up literally having tremors from the glutamate and dopamine, and shivering/shaking because I lacked GHB/Gabapentin. I can take either or and they take away the symptoms. I can only come up with hypothesis as to why this happens. I assume because they\u2019re both inhibitory. Well, the GHB receptor is actually excitatory. \n\nI\u2019d think probably 300-600 mg Gabapentin with some BDO wont hurt. It\u2019s definitely not as safe as one or the other; polydrug combos can often be quite dangerous. Just don\u2019t take the Pregabalin. It\u2019s affinity is too high, it\u2019s bioavailability is too high, and it\u2019s already intoxicating enough on its own. If you\u2019re going to mix anything with GHB, make it weed. Absolutely no anxiety, so you can smoke sativas, w/e.\n\nGood luck, and stay safe.

This is where your body is able to keep itself \"hydrated\" and able to function. If you water down your electrolytes, you\u2019ll never \"quench your thirst,\" you\u2019ll only get thirstier until you die. It\u2019s called water toxicity.

GBL feels better than BDO to me. I think it\u2019s just the way they\u2019re metabolized. BDO is no worse for you than GBL and GHB is no saint either. Most reported causes of toxicity aren\u2019t due to BDO, it\u2019s gamma hydroxybutyrate. BDO and GBL metabolize so rapidly into GHB that there is barely enough time to detect it in the blood (some passes through the kidneys and will remain untouched and detectable in urine even after you\u2019re unable to detect it in blood). After 5 hours of taking a 50mg/kg dose of GHB, it will be entirely undetectable in blood and plasma.\n\nHere is my source, but I have to say, reading it with an unbiased view, all they\u2019re saying is that BDO is toxic... because of GHB. GBL is toxic... because of GHB.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM200101113440202](https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM200101113440202)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwo people in their study died. But if you look at the doses, they ere ignorant fucks who didn\u2019t research what they were taking. One person was taking 5-7.5 mL BDO/day for six months. He survived. Give it a read. It all goes back to the metabolite of all these: GHB.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"The toxic effects of 1,4-butanediol on humans have been described only in abstracts, one case report, one report of mass intoxication at a \u201crave party,\u201d and one 1948 German-language report of coma in seven patients, two of whom died, who had been given 15 g of 1,4-butanediol as a laxative. We assessed nine episodes of toxic effects of 1,4-butanediol in eight patients, two of whom died. The toxic effects of 1,4- butanediol and the health risks associated with it are similar to those of g-butyrolactone and g-hydroxy- butyrate, which is the active metabolite of all three compounds; some users ingest these compounds interchangeably.\"\n\nBDO, in the liver, first undergoes alcohol dehydrogenase, which results in g-Hydroxybutyraldehyde, which is then further metabolized by aldehyde dehydrogenase to finally result in the metabolite and main psychoactive component of GBL and BDO\u2014g-hydroxybutyrate.\n\nThe only thing I can imagine is that the g-Hydroxybutyraldehyde is causing something funky to happen in the system. I am too busy right now, but you may want to look it up and do some research on that stepping stone metabolite of BDO.\n\nOtherwise it\u2019s just as safe as GBL. and GHB so long as you measure doses and don\u2019t fucking take a \"cap full\" like I read about.

I\u2019ll paste it in case you missed.\n\nBDO, in the liver, first undergoes alcohol dehydrogenase, which results in g-Hydroxybutyraldehyde, which is then further metabolized by aldehyde dehydrogenase to finally result in the metabolite and main psychoactive component of GBL and BDO\u2014g-hydroxybutyrate, or GHB.\n\nThe only thing I can imagine is that the g-Hydroxybutyraldehyde is causing something funky to happen in the system. I am too busy right now, but you may want to look it up and do some research on that stepping stone metabolite of BDO.\n\nIt is metabolized the same way alcohol is in the liver. It just doesn\u2019t produce acetaldehyde, which is a known deadly toxic carcinogen. I assume the g-Hydroxybutyraldehyde is what causes the \"dizziness\" and \"blurry vision\" that BDO can cause. That said, so can GBL and GHB. Also, another reason why GBL is wrongly thought of as safer,  1 mL GBL = 1.6 g GHB. It\u2019s far more potent. It lasts longer too, likely because of the way it\u2019s metabolized into GHB in the bloodstream.\n\nUntil someone does a TRUE peer-reviewed study on this, the only conclusion I can come up with is that BDO = GBL in terms of safety/danger (whatever way you want to look at it) and the reason they\u2019re so dangerous is because they metabolize into GHB. Not because they\u2019re BDO or GBL to begin with.\n\nIts just like when Bayer asked Hoffmann to acetylate morphine to try to get codeine, which is much less addictive and potent, for cough drops at the time. And so, into a pan morphine and acetic anhydride go, under reflux, and out pops diacetylmorphine, also known as as Diamorphine in the UK where it is still used in freeze dried ampules in a hospital setting. To the rest of the world, we know it by Bayer\u2019s branding: Heroin. The miracle cure for morphine addiction. That\u2019s how they originally marketed it as. Absolutely ridiculous. Instead of codeine you get something 2.5 stronger that kicks in faster within 2 minutes IV for severe bodily trauma, whereas morphine would take 5 minutes or more to reach its peak analgesic effect.\n\nLittle did Bayer know, that almost instantly, within 2.5 minutes, heroin is metabolized directly back into morphine again in the blood stream. Heroin just crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB) much faster than morphine does. By the time all the heroin is metabolized into morphine, you\u2019ll be long out of pain, or relaxed, or asleep (or vomiting lol). Is heroin safe? In a hospital. Same as almost any opioid. Is it a miracle cure for morphine addiction? Nope. Merely makes you more addicted. Silly fools not testing in-vivo before releasing adverts. :) Could have easily detected morphine metabolites. Oh well. Technology might not have been the best, and they do say hindsight is always 20/20.\n\nGood luck. If you decide to use BDO, go ahead. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s dangerous by itself, 1 mL to start out if you\u2019ve never tried it. Maybe 1.5-2 mL the next time. Don\u2019t ever, ever go higher. BDO is extremely compulsive, and it feels harsh on the liver. Having said that, it\u2019s just as compulsive as GBL or GHB. Nothing about BDO or GBL matter except their metabolization into GHB. And that\u2019s where the danger begins, with GHB toxicity, using so much over so long, or such large doses. (these fools taking 10-15 grams. Some moron took 200 mL and yes he died). That said, so do many psychedelics we use cause problems in the body; maybe not the liver, but the bodyload and vasoconstriction.", "replies": {"fc21whr": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/efepr1/anyone_know_the_long_term_health_effects_of_14_bdo/fc21whr/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1577365953.0, "body": "Thanks for the info!

Stop jerking me around and give me more to numb this with or I\u2019m going to leave right the fuck now and you don\u2019t get paid for surgery.\u201d\n\nHe shut the fuck up, gave me the \u201cexpensive\u201d stuff he was hiding away (what a quack), and when all was said and done, he spoke to me, saying, \u201cIf any doctor EVER has a problem numbing you, you have them call ME. I\u2019LL tell them what\u2019s what.\u201d \n\nYeah OK dentist man. Most doctors (wrongly and sadly tbf) don\u2019t even consider you a doctor. I certainly don\u2019t because of how I was treated. It was funny how he tried to save face like that. Oh well at least he stopped being a dick. I didn\u2019t say any of that mean stuff to him. Got my roxi (he was going to give me codeine) and when I rose my voice to speak, he said, \u201cNo, no. It\u2019s fine. You\u2019re fine. I know when someone needs something or just wants something.\u201d\n\nSo I walked out with a month worth of 40 mg OCs (back in the day). Nothing less would\u2019ve worked. I proved it in front of my doctor. After having a hair sample urine sample blood sample and saliva sample. But then he would administer it to me and we\u2019d talk. He\u2019d judge my reaction time and saw that I needed at least 30 mg oxycodone HCl to get any sort of relief of any pain above a 6. I was currently in so much pain it was a 9, though, and only after my dose got up to 30 mg did my crying turn to just flinching. Then he knew I wasn\u2019t bullshitting him and it\u2019s now documented in my medical records. He apologized for treating me like an addict. Even opioid naive basically (had them for surgery when I was younger; hydrocodone) I was holding a perfect conversation, only stopping it when spikes of pain became unbearable. \n\nI have no problems getting opioid anymore. My last surgery I walked out with a month supply of roxi 30s 4 times a day, and opana 40s 2x a day. Each had a refill. I actually had to refill too, because the surgery pain was that intense. I just got an 8 mg 4 mg and 2 mg buprenorphine from my doctor when I was nearing the end and ready to do a \u201cfast taper.\u201d  8 mg, then 4 mg, 2 mg third day, fourth day stop. Done. I\u2019ve done that for extended fentanyl use too. \n\n*shrug* Sorry for the length, but it goes to show, even doctors can be stupid when it comes to pharmacology. Everyone is unique. Different. Everyone reacts to and metabolizes these chemicals differently. Same for why I can go form not using GHB for a year to 4.5 g and stay awake. I rarely black out unless I lay down and try to.

Meaning it is hard to overdose on. The worst experience I had was an amazing supernod where I passed out and tried to start the same movie again. Then passed out again. Literally the only bad thing was missing the movie. It's probably because I mixed it with two benzos, Phenibut, and gabs. Otherwise things are great. Even that \"bad experience\" was warm and cozy. I also actually got a better nights sleep on it than I ever plan to. It has helped me cope with bipolar disorder and PTSD. I normally have at least two manic episodes a week (lasting a day) and correlated with fears of going to sleep and staying asleep. This knocks me out in only a way high dose benzos will do but without the hangover. Literally the morning after my double nod out I had the chillest experience ever at, to or through an airport.\n\nThe reason I took a high dose was because I decided not to travel with it and with tramadol instead because I didn't wanna pack a baggie and snorting scoop. I opted instead for the trams which looked very similar to my Olanzapine. It felt much dirtier and I sought out the strongest kratom extracts once I was in a legal state. It isn't that I don't have kratom at my disposal it's just that once you're at the ceiling there are bad gastrointestinal effects not true with 2map. Trams are the second treatment I've tried to be dual opiate agonists and work on seritonin.\n\n There have been trials on Tramadol and Tianeptine, and some have been successful and Tianeptine is an approved anti-depressant in several countries but never on a full scale opioid. Tramadol would probably never work in opioid doses for depression as it leads to a dirty mental fog. O-DSMT is the chem I have now and it's only slightly cleaner with a better duration.\n2map's major downfall is it's short duration. You have to redose after 3 or so hours. But the same is true with Tianeptine.\n\nThere are other benefits.\nOn 2 repeated doses of both of us taking 20mg each intranasally, NYE was a magical evening with a girl I only kinda knew. At least for that night I knew her much better and I probably owe it to this chem. \n\nAlso sex on this stuff and a small dose of amps (RC or otherwise) is great because the amps increase sensation and 2map allows you to last n last and women can have multiples during. (I believe this stuff is only a sexual enhancer for men and only when combined with amps. Women may get enhancement from this opioid as well but for them it's mostly the amps.\n\nThe 2 biggest problems with opioids are that they are fatal and how they are illegal. My first only somewhat careful experiences with this chem were very forgiving as I didn't skimp on the rest of my complex cocktail but it enhanced it in ways that were harmless. I had good conversations, was sub euphoric happy or completely euphoric with seemingly anyone and everyone. Even if I'd dosed a bit too much. So that makes this rather safe compared to other opioids. The other pesky part of opioids is the illegality of them.\n\n2-Methyl-AP-237 is federally uncontrolled and 5 state legal as it is only an analog of a Chinese cancer drug Buccinazine which is also uncontrolled.\n\nI dare say that if taken with restraint only 4 days a week that this drug should be considered an antidepressant nootropic. Much like Tianeptine. However Tianeptine WD is often worse than heroins and the WD from 2map is only as bad as morphine WD. Some food for thought is how Suboxone allows former addicts to live normal lives even while treated with subs. If 2map stays classed the way it is, people with complex mental disorders may lead more normal lives as well.\n\nNext up for hot take Monday: Etizolam when not abused is as effective as any benzo.\n\nAlso Clonazolam in low doses may combat both depression and anxiety\n\nEdit: Also no need to go onion farming. 2map, etiz gs and clam gs are incredibly easy to find clearnet!", "author": "StoopSign", "score": 7, "flair": null, "created": 1580780148.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/eyam5b/update_2methylap237_is_my_new_favorite_rc/", "num_comments": 36, "title": "Update: 2-Methyl-AP-237 is my new favorite RC", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"fghd0b2": {"score": 6, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/eyam5b/update_2methylap237_is_my_new_favorite_rc/fghd0b2/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1580810898.0, "body": "Everyone says it\u2019s garbage, but I completely disagree.

I started to get this weird jolting/straight fear feeling throughout my body and then all of a sudden there's firemen and a paramedic comin in my drug infested room asking me questions (even though I couldn't talk) I guess I passed out and hit my head on the table which got my Sisters attention thank God, to which she came in on me having a full on seizure, foamy saliva coming out my mouth, my Sis and my Mom couldn't hold me still I was shaking and jolting so hard with tears just running down my face.

This list reflects my taste, I like unique chemicals, I like the tryptamine though I've stayed away from the breakthrough-type base trypts beacuse they scare me. I've similarly stayed away from stims, though I think I'll try 2-fma for productivity soon. I don't know much about the lysergamides and haven't researched them beacuse after doing LSD exclusivly for so often I got really bored of it and AL-LAD didn't rekindle my interest, though if there's any I really should try I'd like to know about them. I don't want to try opiates, too scary.

I am CaptainEtazene and I'd like to write something about etazene.First of all, it is a very strong opioid. It differs slightly in action from classic opioids. It is a molecular speedball. If you take little, you feel everything at once: euphoria, speed and relaxation. If you take more, euphoria is growing, but the opiate action profile is getting stronger, until you finally fall into opioid drowsiness. Compared to isotonitazene and fentanyl, it was hardly seen to cause respiratory depression. Removal of the nitro group [https://imgur.com/in8mfuX](https://imgur.com/in8mfuX) from etonitazene caused smaller respiratory depression, less hypnotic properties and increased speedball effect.After that, you can work normally and be even more productive than when being sober. Just don't overdo with dose. Small doses - euphoric; high doses - heavy opioid.\n\n*How to dose it?* For total opioid beginner: 0.5-1 mg per spray in nasal spray, causes high euphoria and a feeling of soft legs. 1.5-3 mg already makes you fall asleep.\u00a0 When someone took 30 mg of pure he vomited, went on all fours but was happy.\n\n*How about tolerance?* It grows terribly fast. Within a few days, the dose to be taken to obtain the desired effect can increase several times. There's cross tolerance with other opiates.**The important thing is that a dose depends on the method of administration and what etazene is administered with**!!! For some routes of administration higher dose is needed! Ask your vendor which administration route is best to use for a given etazene product.

What I witness is that there are two currents going on in this reddit:\n\n- There are people truely interested in the effect of these compounds on the mind. They are mostly interested in psychedelics and dissociatives substances. They try not to abuse them and research what potential they have in developing their mind. I see that as a **constructive use**.\n\n- On another hand I see people that are consuming RCs as they would consume any street drug. Benzo, pyrrovalerones, opiates... And so on. What I see there is an abuse that is leading into an harmful direction. I see that as a **destructive use**.\n\nSorry for you reader if you feel that you fall in the second option. But at least you must know that you're putting your life in danger and that of others. \n\nI understand how one would be interested in those compounds as a mean to escape their life and find relief. But hear my word, this is only postponing reality and more you're gonna postpone the harder will the reality be once the effects end. \n\nWhat I also find paradoxical is that having access to RCs, we have access to the poison and the antidote. What I mean by antidote is that dissociatives and psychedelics have high value in healing oneself and having not the need to escape reality anymore but also in helping with kind of addiction.\n\nI really love this subreddit don't get me wrong, but I just wanted to express how sorry I feel when I see all these posts mentioning people how they destroy their life with very powerful compounds while they could try to ameliorate it with the proper substances. Of course harm reduction is also essential.\n\n~~My ultimate wish would be to divide this subreddit into two: one for the abuse of substances and one for the research of potentials using these substances.~~\nRe-edit: my ultimate wish would be to create an additional subreddit that would emphasize on the constructive implications of the use of these compounds. If anyone resonates with this idea please leave a message.\n\nEdit 1: Of course there are also middle grounds between the two opposites i have described. Nothing is all black or all white, we're all a subtle mix of both with some people moving towards one pole or the other. Dissos and psychedelics are not wonder drugs neither and can also be abused in an escape mindset. \n**As Shulgin said, the most important thing is the intention that the user have when he's ingesting the substance**\n\nThe point of my post is not to judge anyone, it's more a reaction to the posts I see in this reddit especially those concerning the super-benzos which are very misused by unconscious people and the ones concerning the pyrovalerones which lend to catastrophes in one's life. These posts make me feel that we're very far from the research and more in the abuse field. \n\nEdit 2: clarification. when I'm talking about research, I'm not talking about proper scientific research in a lab, even if that could be. I'm talking about self-experimental research to explore the potentialities of the mind/Self. In line with the works of R. Strassman, The Shulgins, John C. Lily, S. grof and many others\n\nHowever, this post is open for debates.

They make exceptions based on the medical director's approval, though two other rehabs turned me down first because I wasn't willing to stop taking my Vyvanse.  Seriously, I'm complete shit without it and it's only because of the Vyvanse that I was able to last five straight months in grueling \"sobriety\", what ever the fuck \"sobriety\" is supposed to be.\n\nThey gave me shit for taking fucking Valerian Root in outpatient, saying it's a banned substance, probably because it's a mild GABAergic, but they had no reservations about my Ashwagandha... those idiots.\n\nCoffee and caffeine were banned in residential, but I'd sneak in instant coffee and caffeine pills from CVS and gave some to my roommates who were appreciative.  I'd stash it in the community bathroom so if they were found by the staff we'd all have plausible deniability haha.\n\nCigarettes were allowed and I was literally the only patient who didn't smoke and also the only patient who'd work out all day long.

Also, even relatively healthy people might fall asleep in a sauna on drugs and if you are alone that also might be quite detrimental.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI first had the Idea on Opiates, and started to listen to ASMR Audio on Opiates (which I highly recommend for anyone who likes ASMR for sleeping or relaxation). After I started getting into meditation and a certain method of mental calmness and stoicism inspired by a book I read I also tried combining these. Lately I have been to a sauna more often and had also been doing Benzos and Opiates at the time. I know that it can be harsh on your heart/circulation but since I like taking an occasional risk and never face any problems with long (>/=15 min) sessions of being in >90\u00b0C Saunas I first tried Clonazepam in a Sauna + Meditation, then Kratom, Benzos and a sip of Whiskey with Sauna and Meditation.\n\nBoth experiences were great and I had no problems with my circulation, but I can very well imagine that especially the last one really is not too good for your heart (while sauna generally is considered to be good for your circulation) and I think I stayed to long in a 95\u00b0C Sauna because I could not feel Pain because of the Kratom. However I was good, even after a second session with the second combo on the same evening, what ruined it in the end was the decision to (after taking a short swim in an ice bath) smoke nicotine. I ended up with a fucked up stomach and while I did not vomit it still kind of ruined the rest of the evening. But the rest of the experience was very nice. So if you dare and trust in your circulation, I can recommend it.\n\nIt really was kind of spiritual & Psychedelic to meditate in such a hot sauna for 20min's on Opioids and Benzos, I rarely felt so deeply relaxed. I really want to try this with Dissociatives (low to mediocre dose). Also note that I have only once during these experiences have been alone in the sauna and even then only for a short period of time. Be sure to have someone around even if its someone you dont know, they'll pick you up if you stop sitting and start falling into yourself in a sauna (But you should not rely on a person you dont know, that also really is far from morally OK).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso Psychedelics + Meditation is very cool. Whilst I've never experienced any spiritual experience with mere meditation, I made some interesting discoveries whilst meditating on psychedelics. I recommend you give that one a try. Dissociatives also really have a neat combination with meditation, especially at those not quite but almost hole doses where your body starts to dissolve in music or thoughts while you could theoretically still open your eye's / move even though your body is numb.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll end this post with a Table of the combinations I tried. Please let me know about any experiences you made and comment if you have a recommendation for me and other fellow researchers to try.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Drugs / Relaxing Practices|Sauna|Meditation|ASMR|Sauna & Meditation|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Opioids/Opiates|Take care, really enjoyable nevertheless.|Adds a nice touch, but nothing too special really|Really Cool, the Drug & Practice both enhance each other.|Almost spiritual. Very pleasant and worth a try, but be aware of the dangers.|\n|Benzos|Extra relaxing, you might fall asleep though, so take care.|Not recommended, just meditate and take benzos afterwards, it takes something away.|Nothing special really, you'll probably fall asleep in seconds.|Extra relaxing, you might fall asleep though, so take care. Benzos take away some of the Meditations \"Magic\"|\n|Dissociatives|Haven't tried it yet, want to though. Might be dangerous.|Very interesting & intense. Recommended.|Interesting once, but nothing too special.|Not tried either. Caution.|\n|Psychedelics|I really want to try this, but sadly have not. This also might be not very safe depending on your experience level and circulation.|Very spiritual but in higher doses its very hard to keep up the process of watching your thoughts flow by.|I did not like it, some of you might, worth trying though.|I also really want to try this, but sadly have not. This also might be not very safe depending on your experience level and circulation.|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, for the post in r/researchemicals : If you are wondering why am I posting this in r/researchchemicals and not (just) r/Drugs ? Well, because imo this subreddit is more dedicated towards drugs, I feel like the community is more into stuff like this.  Also I only tried these with RC-Dissociatives, although Id like to try some normal Ketamine in a Sauna, sounds worth a try.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not rely on this as info for safety of these combos. Im not sure whether most people will have as little of an amount of problems with sauna + drugs (especially downers) as I had, also, if you like the Idea, please remember to upvote. I'm often frustrated when people like posts and their Ideas but forget to upvote and therefore few people get to see the post. I'd really like these Ideas to be spread, because many are worth trying. Not directly asking, if you dont like it downvote / dont vote do whatever you want, just wanted to remind people because I also often forget to upvote interesting posts I see although I comment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading until here, keep on researching fellow researchers.\n\nDeus vult nos quaerere !", "author": "G1nnnn", "score": 25, "flair": null, "created": 1580253164.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/ev6ta8/do_you_like_relaxing_thingsmethods_like_visiting/", "num_comments": 31, "title": "Do you like relaxing Things/Methods like visiting a Sauna, Asmr, Meditation etc. with Drugs ?

I'm a reasonably well respected, published scientist, and hold a PhD in my field. I've spent months bingeing on cocaine and IV heroin on numerous occasions, and I've had a troublesome relationship with alcohol for many years, but I've always been able to stop with relative ease when I'd decided enough was enough.\n\nI'm a huge fan of ketamine, but I've also been able to control my usage. With PCP analogues however, both 3-MeO-PCP and 3-HO-PCP, its another story.\n\nWith 3-MeO-PCP, I slowly ramped the dose with minimal effects and some very mild dissociation. It was severe on the nose. It burned and caused excessive rhinorrhea (runny nose), but I persisted, every evening and late into the night. Eventually one evening I dosed in the region of 20-30 mg and was overcome with mania, pulling apart a room in my house several times to find something I'd dropped. Crawling around the floor, dragging furniture around, drenched in sweat. Consumed in a frenzy, I searched and searched until I found the bulldog clip I'd dropped - something I normally wouldn't give a shit about as I have plenty more. \n\nAfter that, I knew this wasn't going anywhere good. I can't recall if I sampled it again, but then, or soon thereafter, I flushed it. Enough was enough.\n\nThen came 3-HO-PCP... WOW! This was the stuff I'd been waiting for! Again, I ramped up the dose from 4 mg until the opiate, dissociating bliss consumed me. I was in awe. It was perfect. Ideal time frame, manageable intoxication, and a miniscule dose - just a few tiny bumps was enough. I was euphoric, dissociated and delightfully stoned. I told myself I'd consume it a few days per week, but that never happened. As soon as I was an hour from the end of my work, I'd swallow a capsule, then proceed to take bumps every couple of hours til bed. The dosage grew and grew until I was averaging 12 mg with 36 mg now and again to end the night.\n\nI told myself to take a break. I told myself if I did, I would keep a little stash and enjoy it now and then. I couldn't. Everyday, evening to night I was dissociated. I was waking up exhausted. I was making spelling mistakes in emails and texts. I was forgetting things that I'd said or done, where I'd stashed my baggy, what day it was, who I'd spoken to, what work I'd done, etc. I found I was becoming more outgoing, chatting to people, becoming more enthusiastic about my plans, my thoughts, my ideas. Mania was creeping in, subtly, bit by bit. And yet I bought more (thankfully a fraction of what I'd originally planned). \n\nI began pushing it too far. People around me took notice. Combining it with the tiniest bit of alcohol or cannabis pushed me over the edge. Confusion and loss of awareness crept in. I kept burying my head in the sand, pretending (or convinced) everything was fine. Why not sample a new RC every month?! I was in control of course, and this one was going so well! Maybe I should order some more coke and ket too, maybe they'd go well with this!\n\nAs I sat at my desk, reading the same messages from friends over and over, the words made perfect sense individually, but the sentences did not. I had no idea how to formulate a response. I stared in absent confusion. I had spent weeks, maybe months, day after day in this distant state. I couldn't respond to the simplest message. Did that make sense? Was I even answering their question? What if they noticed? Did I say that already? \n\nThis happened numerous times. Hints from those close to me that my behaviour was bordering on bizzare begin to sink in - but only when heavily intoxicated.

It is a natural energy, I feel recharged, more grounded, it is not that jittery push of amphetamines, it is a clear headed, natural focus.Overall, it seems to me that the chemical mix that gets released in the brain is awesome.I forgot to mention, microdoses of LSD are awesome for this purpose, it is a waste of dose for me if I dont go jogging or cycling when microdosing.I tried doing it on a low doses of amphs like 2-fma, but then I have a feeling that I am straining the heart too much, it does not feel right exercising vigorously on amphetamines.\n\nAnyway, what I am trying to say is that this chemical mix feels awesome to me, and I have not really replicated it with chemicals so far. There is a psychological component to it, it feels earned, deserved. I wonder what chemical combo would replicate it, maybe a low dose of a clean stimulant like meth (when you have no tolerance) armodafinil or 2-fma, low dose of of high class opiate like oxy or something (I have no real experience) and maybe a moderate dose of CBD.

For those unaware, keto is short for ketogenic diet. It\u2019s high fat, low carb. When you have an abundance of carbs in your diet your main energy source is glucose. When you cut the carbs, your body switches to using fat for energy instead (well technically ketones, but fuck you nerd. Who cares).\n\nIt\u2019s got me thinking about how this affects drugs and your reaction to them. I mean; your body is running on a completely different fuel source. So it\u2019s gotta have an effect on how drugs effect you right?\n\nMy personal experience;\n\n* Opiates feel way cleaner on keto. I get pretty bad nausea and itchiness from opiates usually but I\u2019ve noticed when I\u2019m keto, opis have far less side effects and more euphoria.\n\n* MUCH lower tolerance to alcohol. This is well known, but, when following a keto diet, most people find their alcohol tolerance is like 1/2 of what it normally is\n\n* GHB and its prodrugs also hit you harder. This makes sense. When you\u2019re following a keto diet, your brain actually already makes something called BHB, which has similar effects.\n\n* Stims just fucking suck on keto. Keto can kind of dehydrate you. Also carbs are really involved in the release of serotonin. The result; far less euphoria, far more side effects. I\u2019ve never tried empathogens on keto though. But I can say; amphetamines and cathinones are not very fun on keto.\n\n* Dissociatives seem to also be increased. This makes sense as well. Being keto increases the brain\u2019s production of agmatine (a naturally occurring NMDA-antagonist)\n\n* I haven\u2019t really noticed a difference with psychs. Maybe a clearer headspace. Keto just makes my head feel clearer in general though. I have taken psychs during the \u201cketo flu\u201d (when your body is adjusting to the new diet for 1-2 weeks). Awful, awful trips every time. Do not trip unless you\u2019ve been keto for at least 3-4 weeks. The keto flu can feel like hell at times, adding psychs to that can be a recipe for disaster.\n\n* Weed. I\u2019m one of those people that reacts very unpredictably to weed. I\u2019d say, for me, weed is generally fun 70% and the other 30% of the time I just get anxious and depressed. I have noticed I get more anxiety from weed when on keto. I\u2019ve heard that weed drops your blood sugar so that could be why, idk.\n\nAnyone have any experience with keto and drugs and how they effect one-another?", "author": "KetogenicKraig", "score": 11, "flair": null, "created": 1597052141.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/i6vmyz/anyone_here_do_keto/", "num_comments": 22, "title": "Anyone here do keto?", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"g0yaaqf": {"score": 6, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i6vmyz/anyone_here_do_keto/g0yaaqf/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597052987.0, "body": "Just asking, but do you think it would be healthy to \u201ctransition\u201d between fuel types often?

I first was introduced to RCs when I was around 16 and buying JWH-XXX\u2019s because they were very cheap and accessible. In retrospect I was far too young to even be consuming psychoactive chemicals, much less synthetic cannabinoids. That continued for probably about a year until I started doing opiates more frequently and by 18 I could snort 3 roxi 30\u2019s and barely get a buzz and by 19 I was a full blown iv heroin addict.\n\nFast forward 7 years through 30+ times in and out of rehabs(many times not completing them), several overdoses, iv coke/meth added in the mix, jail and we get to a year ago where I finally have myself somewhat put together and i start working on getting out of the system but have have to stop consuming cannabis and fall into a deep depression.\n\nI started falling apart quick without the cannabis and was on the verge of suicide. I know it\u2019s not great to be treating by playing doctor with drugs but I\u2019m not ready to be completely sober so I had to do something so I start researching RCs again. I find the current RC cannabinoids on the market aren\u2019t anything I want any parts of so I ordered 1cp-lsd along with some other stuff and it was truly a great decision. That was in March of this year and on my first trip I had so many deep thoughts about my life and the pain I was experiencing and what I needed to do to move forward and made so much progress in that experience that it truly may have stopped me from relapsing on heroin or killing myself because I was in such a bad place. \n\nAt the end of April my biggest fear came to reality and my grandmother, whom helped raise me for years, got Covid and had many pre existing health conditions and passed away. I\u2019m not close with much of my family so the thought of losing any of the few I am haunted me growing up. To the point of I remember being 12 and wanting to join the military at 18 so I could die as what I saw an honorable death at the time and never have to deal with losing anyone. Had this of happened in March in complete sobriety I would have went off the deep end. \n\nAbout two weeks after she passed I took 300ug of 1cp-lsd and watched The Midnight Gospel on Netflix and had one of the most introspective, emotional and therapeutic experiences of my life. Shout out to Duncan Trussell because that night changed my life.\n\nSo things were going somewhat good but with quarantine I started getting bored and got the dumb idea to dive into RC opioids. HUGE MISTAKE. I also got into some RC stims and tryptamines but I made the bad decision of slamming 2-map and o-dsmt. I got to the point where I was doing a lot and for a while and started getting bad WDs. Explored some iV stims too but found it\u2019s a dumb idea. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few weeks not since I threw away the rest of my 2map and used the rest of the o-dsmt after having a moment of clarity that by abusing RCs like I was it was no different than abusing meth/heroin and honestly probably worse and less safe. Used kratom to wein myself off and 3-fpm to help get through work. Can\u2019t say I\u2019ll never slam an RC again but I\u2019m definitely gonna do my damn best not to and not abuse them and I don\u2019t ever wanna get another opioid again. \n\nIdk why I\u2019m writing this, mostly hoping my experience will stop someone from making the same mistake I did and let people know how insidious opioids can be. And hey, I\u2019m not preaching that no one should do them because I\u2019m sure some people can use them responsibly like I can use benzos responsibility and just stop doing them whenever and not redose and blackout. Hell, I\u2019ve had a shit ton of etiz and clam laying around for like 6 months and used it once each and probably am gonna give most away and just keep a few doses of the etiz for an emergency situation. But if opioids/opiates bring you to your knees like they do me, heed my warning and if you\u2019ve never tried them before you\u2019re honestly not missing out on anything and your money is much better spend on things like lysergamides, tryptamines, mushrooms and phenethylamines.

Opiates kept me from coming quickly, which was great, but decreased both our libidos substantially. In the years since we stopped shooting dope we've been doing this slow pump missionary thing like once a week. It's always felt more like work than pleasure. \n\n\n\nBut then I received some 3-MEO-PCP and 3-HO-PCP. This shit turned me into a _fucking animal_. First, I can pump as hard and fast as I want with no danger of premature explosion. I'd be happy enough with the stamina increase but, no, it doesn't stop there. All my usual inhibitions have gone out the window. All of a sudden I'm eating her ass, telling her to finger my ass, biting nipples, pulling hair. We fucked in the kitchen last night. Five times in the last three days. \n\n\nThis shit is a game changer.

It\u2019s longer lasting and feels like oxycodone lite for the first 3 hours and then it\u2019s sedating so it\u2019s great to nod on... atleast in high doses like 150+.. Some people react differently to it so your experience may vary depending on tolerance, potency, dosage.. etc\n    \n   A lot of people bitch & moan saying O-DSMT isn\u2019t cost effective per dose... not true whatsoever, especially compared to street prices for oxycodone.\n    \n   O-DSMT is actually quite cheap & very affordable if you know where to look, for example I spend around $300 for 10 grams of AMAZING quality O-DSMT from my domestic US source.. \n\n     No, I will NOT share my sources publicly or privately, as that\u2019s against the rules.... and PLEASE DO NOT message me asking where I cop from.\n\n    It\u2019s possible to use O-DSMT intravenously but it\u2019s pretty pointless from what I\u2019ve read about it.. I haven\u2019t tried it myself because fuck needles.\n\n    Plugging, and oral are the best ROA ime..\nI redose throughout the day via intranasal and it works great in doses around 50mg (anymore then that and your nose gets insta-clogged).\n\n\u20142-METHYL-AP-237\u2013\n\n   I haven\u2019t really enjoyed 2-methyl-ap-237 as it leaves me with this nasty feeling and a bad headache.. although it is the most similar to morphine potency wise the list of side effects makes it intolerable in my experience.\n\n\n\u2014TIANEPTINE\u2014\n\n   Tianeptine sodium is on par with heroin euphoria wise. Side effects make it intolerable as well.\n\n   The euphoria lasts for 30 minutes. Redosing doesn\u2019t increase euphoria, it only increases side effects. (Heart burn, sour stomach etc..)\nIt\u2019s very caustic so the only viable ROA is oral.\n\n\n\u2014O-AKMD\u2014\n\nI personally have no experience with this RC yet, but the pharmacology is incredibly interesting.. \n\nThere was a lot of anticipation for this RC, in hopes it would be the \u201choly grail\u201d of RC opioids with an expected potency on par with oxymorphone.. unfortunately that isn\u2019t the case.\n\nFrom all the experience reports I\u2019ve read so far it hasn\u2019t seemed to live up to the hype/expectations. \n\nI did read somewhere that it\u2019s similar to oxycodone stimulation wise. Which sounds good for when you don\u2019t want to nod the fuck out at work or whatever the case. \n\nFrom what I\u2019ve seen from my sources so far, this RC isn\u2019t very cost efficient... at least for now.. \n(I think vendors knew the hype was insane for this RC and they wanted to make a quick buck off all the eager \u201cresearchers\u201d) ...the price per gram may drop lower soon now that people have gotten to experience the supposed \u201choly grail\u201d.  For the most part a lot of researchers have been disappointed by it... \nthe hype for it has died down it seems.\n\nSorry I can\u2019t go in to too much detail about the effects as I haven\u2019t gotten the chance to try this one out YET.\n\n\u2014OTHERS\u2014\n\nI\u2019m not going to bring up the stupidly potent RC opioids because they are terrible for recreational usage and lack euphoria, plus this thread is based around RC\u2019s similar to morphine.\n\nThere are WAY too many overdoses relating to the fentalogues, and other potent chems like isotonitazene. \n\nIf you do know how to SAFELY use & ACCURATELY dose these monster opioids right, then these chems will FUCK UP your life when abused... Your tolerance will sky rocket to the point of heroin feeling like Tylenol.. you won\u2019t be able to enjoy weaker opiates/opioids until you reset your receptors through abstinence of all opiates/opioids for months/years..   for me personally and many others it\u2019s just not worth it.. \n\nLONG STORY SHORT... stick with O-DSMT!!\n\n(Edited because I\u2019m stupid)", "replies": {"f9k85bs": {"score": 4, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/e5idi1/rc_opioids_most_similar_to_morphinediacetyl/f9k85bs/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1575423702.0, "body": "180/g is pretty expensive.", "replies": {"f9k8w0i": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/e5idi1/rc_opioids_most_similar_to_morphinediacetyl/f9k8w0i/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1575424159.0, "body": "I get it for $20-35/g", "replies": {"f9kbx84": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/e5idi1/rc_opioids_most_similar_to_morphinediacetyl/f9kbx84/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1575426013.0, "body": "Glad more people aren\u2019t spending $100/G like most vendors offer O-DSMT for.

For nearly a decade now, actually. Somewhat recently, my dose became much higher than I was comfortable with and began searching for other options. \n\n\nI learned about opioid RCs a bit too late apparently, since the ideal compound for me was apparently gone (isotonitazene). The next best thing was etazene, at 25x the potency of morphine. It\u2019s an analogue of etonitazene, which has urban legends surrounding it and horror stories of its own.\n\n\nAnyway, my fentanyl use had exceeded 30mg a day at the point of my acquisition of etazene, which was just unacceptable due to the ups and downs it caused. I began dosing etazene, by itself first thing in the morning, beginning with 50-75mg to start. \n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t quite enough, so I upped my dosage to 100-150mg, and found this to be quite acceptable. The euphoria is absolutely there, challenging any opiate/opioid I\u2019ve ever tried honestly. Pain relief is wonderful as well, and general sense of motivation+well-being as well. Not like the euphoria I get from fentanyl at all, really (and yes, I DO get euphoria from fentanyl).\n\n\nOver the last two months or so, I\u2019ve managed to drop my fentanyl dosage to 10mg per day, and have kept my etazene usage about the same as initially. I\u2019m not trying to quit anything right now, my life is actually pretty great to be honest, I don\u2019t have anything to complain about aside from my dependencies. \n\n\nAll in all, I\u2019ve found etazene to be a great substance for my needs. No weird side effects noted, and I\u2019ve been using daily for ~2-3 months now. It\u2019s been a wonderful addition to my \u201cprogram\u201d and has aided in doing something I didn\u2019t think possible. \n\n\nI must stress that my doses are NOT typical, and should not be taken by anybody that isn\u2019t already at my level of tolerance/dependence.

Even things like kratom and phenibut should be avoided.\n\nSo what I'm looking for are how GHB/GBL/BDO combines with psychedlics (esp. 1p-LSD, 2c-b-fly), emphatogens (esp. 6-apb, 5-mapb) and stimulants. Also how a low dose of GHB could be useful in combos could be interesting.\n\nI already tried 1,4-BDO alone.

But in rats, the constant NMDA antagonism of very high doses does in fact cause irreversible brain damage which the brain tries to recover from with neuroplasticity. I don't think it is unreasonable to assume it could do something similar to humans, I would advise caution against it out of uncertainty. But that's just me, this is a sub for rc's after all so I get it. \n\nI personally believe I did damage my brain from overuse because it took a while for me to be able to even speak fluently again and not getting tripped up on words, also had issues understanding what people were saying for a while after stopping, almost like verbal dyslexia.

The \"sleep\" they provide is not REM (restorative) sleep. In other words, even if you are unconscious for 8 hours on a dose of benzos the net gain of that \"sleep\" is equivalent to a short nap.

But this is misleading for many drugs that have a wide dosing profile. Inspired to write this cause on 2 mg etizolam (pardon the spelling mistakes), which makes a good example. \n\nLet\u2019s say someone takes a benzo with a dose of 1 mg and a half-life of 50 hours. If you say the effects of the drug last, say, 50 or 60 hours because then the dose in your body is halved which is probably sub-perceptual at that point. This predictions works if you take the thereputic dose, yes. But if you take double the dose, after 50 hours half of it will be excreted, so it\u2019ll be as if you just took the drug at the lower dose. The effects would last 100 hours. This introduces a huge new element for benzos, psychedelics, dissociatives, and probably opiates as well. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Can we come up with a simple equation where you plug in your dose and it gives you your specific time durations? I think this would be super handy for a wide variety of things.\n\nI know that some drugs have pretty non-linear response curves, so for some we could have to take a closer look at what\u2019s happening.

Nothing out there that really compares to that strength.

I know it burns like a bitch when snorted and people say it's caustic as hell and fucks your nose up but pretty sure it has a much higher bioavailability nasally vs oral. So ups and downs to the different ROAs.   But with a tolerance of 120 mgs oxycodone a day, shit idk. You'd obviously have to play around and teeter your dosage up and down until you find the perfect dose, but I would guess 75 mgs would be an average dose for someone of your tolerance. But Ive read tolerance to it builds fast and after a couple weeks of daily use you could be using 300 mgs per dose.\n\n **DONT take that starting dose estimate as a forsure, start low and always go higher if needed, you can't go the other way**\n\nSo basically you either need to go with something super potent which will wreck your tolerance or you need to go with something weaker and take larger amounts which is obviously more pricey. So it comes down to tolerance vs price.\nI don't believe there's anything on the market that's about the same as oxycodone rn. Youre probably better off sticking to your precribed oxys. \n\n2 map 237 is probably the closest thing you'll find to oxy strength but like I said tolerance builds very fast and the best way to take it (snorted) is painful as shit.

Of course I knew it wasn't going to be the same thing, but I've also enjoyed my trips on pretty much all the 2Cx's I've tried (though none so much as 2C-B), so if it was at all similar to *any* of them I figured it would be worth trying for me. I did also read that some of the \"physical trip\" did have aspects that were similar to 2C-B, which made me pretty interested.\n\nThe other reason I really wanted to try this substance was the feedback I've seen for it online. It really seems to be one of the more divisive psychedelics I've seen. I've had multiple people tell me that it's absolutely one of their favorite compounds, and many more who either really loved the experience or simply kind of dug it. Ann Shulgin herself has claimed it was one of her favorite substances to use. On the other hand, I've also seen many people who quite literally think that 2C-B-FLY is worthless. Lots of people saying not to try it, or that the best place for it is the trash. Granted there are also plenty of people who lie somewhere in the middle, but the fact that I've seen so many responses that are on such opposite ends of the spectrum really peaked my interest. From the descriptions given to me by those who *did* like it, it sounded like it could actually be up my alley.\n\nSo I ended up getting some, and after doing an allergy test and making sure I didn't end up with something else, I took a 15mg dose based on what I had heard and the psychonautwiki info on the drug. And as for my general impressions: I did actually enjoy this one. I think that next time I would take closer to 20+mg. Based on the dosage info on psychonautwiki, I was kind of expecting it to be a little more potent dosage-wise to the other 2C's I've tried, when in fact I think it was actually pretty similar. As far as the effects go, I also found that it was pretty familiar to many of the other 2Cx's I've tried. It had been a long time since I've tried any of them, and as soon as the effects really took hold I was immediately reminded of my time experimenting with the other 2C compounds. I do find that generally, all the 2CX's I've tried have very similar visuals and headspaces, even compared to other psychedelics of the same chemical class. There are small exceptions, 2C-B for instance feels a bit more like \"it's own thing\" to me, though it definitely still has the distinct \"2C\" vibe to it. Also, I've found that 2C-I and 2C-T2 were far more stimulating, which leads me to prefer the \"smoother\" trips of 2C-E and 2C-T-2.\n\nI keep coming back to comparisons with other 2Cx chemicals just based on how similar 2C-B-FLY was to them. I think it bore the most resemblance to 2C-E or 2C-T-2; while it had that classic phenethlymine  energy and 'stimulation', it didn't feel quite as speedy as some of the other ones like 2C-I, and it had that very smooth trip I've come to associate with my preferred 2C substances. The headspace itself was relatively clear headed, maybe more so than any other psychedelic I've done (though this may be due to the lower dose that I took). While to me it felt closer to 2C-E or 2C-T-2, I did find that it did have a similar \"physical warmth\" to 2C-B, though it wasn't nearly as constant and came in much more pronounced and spaced out \"waves\". With 2C-B that warm rush, which almost feels like MDMA or even an opiate, is much more constant throughout the experience, and I wonder if it would have been the same way with 2C-B-FLY if I had taken a larger dose. I did really like most of the physical sensations I got from this one, though. I felt extra sensitive to everything, and there were times where it felt as good to move and touch things as it does with something like MDMA... though there was significantly less euphoria than a substance like that.\n\nI did notice some side effects, more so than I have with any other 2C. Granted, it's been almost a decade since I have experimented with other 2Cx's, so the fact that I had more side effects from this one may be a result of me being older than I was when tripping on the others. But for one thing, for the first 2 hours or so of the trip I felt very bloated and full... even though it had been *several* hours since I had eaten and I had gone into the experience with an empty stomach. I was also (tmi alert) pretty gassy the next day. There was definitely a comedown as well... and I wouldn't say it was bad... in fact, I felt pretty good through the comedown. But I was definitely clinching my jaw a lot, which reminded me of MDMA. I never remembered clinching my jaws while coming down off of the other 2C's, but again it's been a long time so who knows.\n\nFinal thoughts: I quite enjoyed it. Definitely not as much as 2C-B, but certainly in the ballpark of 2C-E and 2C-T-2 (my 2nd and 3rd favorite 2Cx compounds). In terms of the effects, I may have liked it more than 2C-E even. I'd have to try a larger dose to say for sure. But I felt like there were also more side effects to this  one than there were with 2C-E or most of the others. The gastro stuff for sure I don't remember experiencing at all before. But the trip was quite nice, and the fact that I ever experienced that 2C-B style \"warmth\" goes a long way for me. Personally, I don't see why people call it trash. But everyone has different opinions on what they want out of a substance, as well as unique physiological builds that will make them react differently. If I had never read so many people saying that it's garbage, I would have recommended this one. But since there are a good few voices out there who hate it, I guess I'd say proceed with caution. And be prepared for some digestive side effects, though at no point did they ruin the experience or get to me- they were actually pretty mild, just noticeable. But again, as far as the trip itself is concerned, I would probably put it among my favorite 2Cx compounds.", "author": "istartedatoke", "score": 19, "flair": null, "created": 1597358738.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/i916bl/thoughts_on_2cbfly/", "num_comments": 19, "title": "Thoughts on 2C-B-FLY", "subreddit": "researchchemicals", "comments": {"g1c6sfa": {"score": 7, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i916bl/thoughts_on_2cbfly/g1c6sfa/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597362568.0, "body": "Thank you for this post!\n\nI am going to try 2C-B-FLY for the first time very soon and I am struggling to find complete overviews of experiences.\n\nYour post is pretty extensive on what I can expect", "replies": {}}, "g1cpa18": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i916bl/thoughts_on_2cbfly/g1cpa18/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597370689.0, "body": "I love the 2Cx compounds, 2CB, 2CI and 2CE especially.

The enhanced appreciation of nature was definitely there, and though it wasn't quite as dramatic as with some other psyches for me the night sky and the trees were definitely really awesome.\n\nBut yeah, when I do my 20mg trip I'll definitely talk more about the experience itself.", "replies": {}}}}, "g1cywex": {"score": 3, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i916bl/thoughts_on_2cbfly/g1cywex/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597375033.0, "body": "Thanks for the report, it's one of the most detailled I've seen on this one.

For one, 2C-B-FLY reminded me of the 2Cx's in general, and 2C-E was the one I tried the most (even including 2C-B). Also, the trip was among the \"smoother\" experiences I've had with the 2Cx's (sorry if that sounds really vague), which I associated with 2C-E and 2C-T-2. And in general, the \"visual\" aspect of the trip very much reminded me of those same compounds.\n\nHowever, it was definitely more clear headed than 2C-E was. Again, my dose was low so I'm sure that helped, but the headspace was not mindfucky at all. So I can see how that could seem very \"relaxed\" or \"playful\" for people. To me, it honestly kind of feels like it's some sort of blend of 2C-E and 2C-B. I do think I need to try it again at a higher dose to really get a gauge on it, though.\n\nThe mind is a really powerful thing though, so a lot of these impressions I got may have been biased by the association of the other 2CX's in my memory. It did immediately remind me of them, but once that happened my brain may have just immediately started associating it with the ones I've done a lot of (like 2C-B and 2C-E).", "replies": {}}}}, "g1c1l1f": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/i916bl/thoughts_on_2cbfly/g1c1l1f/", "is_submitter": false, "created": 1597360122.0, "body": "How where the psychedellic effects in your experience?

You MUST stop taking Subutex for at least 24-36 hours before proceeding with everything I wrote here below.\n\nIf you are taking fenta analogues, vaping is the 2.nd most safe RoA you can use.The safest is to smoke on glass pipe, but if you have pure compounds, you need to have Mannitol and a very precise scale or analytical scale.\n\nFu-F is approx 25x morphine potency. Depending your tolerance, and seen your Subu Barrier, it's not that you are new to Opiates and I don't think you are stupid to overdose.\n\nFu-F vaporized requires a pretty higher dosage than smoked, snorted or oral/IV, that is normally for people with low tolerance 0.5-1mg.\n\nThis dosage suggestion is based on Intel that I got from the seller providing Fu-F E-Liquid that was sold for long in 2018 on DNM, was dosed 400mg/10ML, and considered \"safe\" for the beginners. All depends how many puffs you take, how long you keep the smoke, and many other variables.\n\nI have made myself Vape Liquid but using FFF and not Fu-F. FFF is stronger than Fu-F, approx 35x morphine potency. 400mg/10ML of FFF was a pretty strong dosage, even with only 3-4 Puffs.\n\nTherefore if you are not absolutely sure that what you get is Fu-F, and could be another analogue, then d**on't do stupid things** and start with a lower dosage of 100-200mg/10ML. **And before this, either LAB TEST what you got or proceed VERY SAFE doing an allergy test, then by volumetric dosage prepare a spray and start with the absolute minimum of 10-20ug**. I know it's a pain and it takes many days to find the threshold, but better waste some days that be dead.\n\nBy preparing your E-liquid you must be ABSOLUTELY sure the compound is TOTALLY dissolved and the E-Liquid is crystal clear and homogeneous.\n\nYou can achieve this by taking a normal E-Liquid with the flavor you prefer, and after you verified what you got is 100% Fu-F, then put 300-400mg in 10ML and mix/shake it very well. This will NOT be enough to have an homogeneous solution: you need to wait 12 hours and shake/mix again, or you can GENTLE warm the liquid, put in a glass vials, and keep mixing in the meantime.\n\nBe very careful to not heat too much, or you will break the molecules making it less effective. If you do it properly, after you do this process to warm/heat 2-3 times and keep mixing, the E-Liquid should become again completely transparent.\n\nBefore usage, make sure the liquid is still totally homogeneous and proceed taking small puffs without keeping the smoke too long in your lungs.\n\nBe safe.", "replies": {"f61omf5": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/dphfmz/fuf_ejuice_help/f61omf5/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1572672325.0, "body": "Thanks for the heads up and VERY RELEVANT and HELPFUL information/advice...

Most is background, the important stuff is in the last 3 paragraphs. \n\n\nHaving some issues. \n\nStim naive, decided to go with some 4F-MPH as I\u2019d heard it was nice and furiously without being too euphoric or fiendy. Want to try 2-FMA as I heard it was a good time more than fictional, but my vendor didn\u2019t have it in stock this time(I\u2019d like to have one I enjoy of each, functional and recreational). \n\nSomething that concerns me is that my vendors site was down yesterday, so I couldn\u2019t even log in to even check to see that I\u2019d actually ordered 4fmph and not another mph analogue or a cathinone of some sort accidentally and had the wrong compound name in my head, the length on this just seems way too long based on descriptions. \n\nI find that a really enjoyed the stimulation and motivation boost, and it gave me a nice mood boost as well. No rushing heart or noticeable BP issues. Not euphoria, just a little less pissed off at difficulties during jobs. I also noticed a very nice boost to my sex drive and sexual abilities(both in my opinion and my GFs) about 4 hours after my initial dose.  however I didn\u2019t realize how goddamn long it would take to clear my system. \n\nI took 5 mg at around 3:00 yesterday, waited for 1 hour, and redosed another 4-5mg(teetering between measurements on a Gemini 20) as I wasn\u2019t feeling anything(oral for both). I am aware this isn\u2019t the best idea with this compound due to its long come up, but I felt confident I could handle it. \n\nSo I\u2019m at 10 mg, still pretty tired from being up all night due to my irregular insomnia(it\u2019s like every 3rd-5th night or so, and is work-stress related or occasionally due to an arylcyclohexylamine binge (I quite enjoy 4-HO-PCP and ketamine and her analogues. Not tried other PCP analogies yet but I have others and O-PcE on the way). Never been more than 1 night in a row). \n\nAround 6pm I decide I\u2019m still not feeling much, and snorted one more 5mg dose. About 20 mins later I felt it and was impressed. I was slightly distracted for 15-20 mins at the beginning, but then the focus kicked in and I was on top of everything until 10 pm. Then I went to the neighbors house and hung out for a while, talking way more than the rest of the group(I was monologuing and would occasionally stop to allow someone else a sentence or maybe two), and didn\u2019t leave until 2:45 am without realizing how late it had gotten. At this point, I\u2019m still not tired but I could tell my neighbor was, so I went home and cleaned until my alarm went off the next morning at 7am. \n\nI\u2019m now at 3:10 pm, 24 hours after my initial dose and 21 after the 3rd and final dose when I finally started feeling it. \n\nI\u2019m still stimmed out and don\u2019t think I can sleep even now. I\u2019m definitely crashing, really began to feel it around 9am this morning(23 hours after the high wore off, it\u2019s been residual stimulation since then), and I\u2019ve gotten progressively more irritable and sluggish throughout the day. \n\n\n<b>The breakdown<\\b>\n\n\n3 doses over a few hours, stim newbie.  5mg for the TL;DR-ers. Last dose at T+31\nI was smart enough not to redose when I began to crash around 9-10 am, though I did have a cup of coffee this morning. That\u2019s certainly helping me keep going, but I don\u2019t know what to do if I still can\u2019t sleep after work. \n\nI have zero benzos or opiates/oids, besides Kratom(maeng da green, seems pretty stimmy to me and I usually use 2-3 grams on mornings when I\u2019m a little drowsy. Similar to how many people would use a cup or two of coffee). I\u2019ve got cannabis, but it did nothing to get me to sleep yesterday. \n\nAny thoughts on how I can get to sleep, or why this might be taking me so long to process? I realize it was 15 mg which is a huge beginner dose, but I really thought I\u2019d have been able to sleep around 4-5 am based on other people\u2019s descriptions of this compound. Is it just because I never use stims? I read that meth can last a ridiculous amount of time your first dose or two, is that what I\u2019m running into? When could we expect me to actually come down enough to call it a night? Getting a little concerned, don\u2019t want to be one of those people on multiple day no-sleep benders from stims talking to shadow people and running from invisible spiders.

I always tare a weigh pan+capsule, and then add a 10g weight ontop (after warmup+2 calbrations) so the weight should read exactly 10.000g all in all. Try to weigh each dose inside a capsule with this method for best accuracy, the 10g weight helps judge accuracy by the 10.000 reading, and it seems to notice small changes better this way. \n\nThis is of course if you are planning to snort, a volumetric solution is much much easier and predictable.", "replies": {"frfu1xl": {"score": 1, "link": "/r/researchchemicals/comments/go3lar/help_up_almost_48_hours_on_4fmph/frfu1xl/", "is_submitter": true, "created": 1590176592.0, "body": "Thank you for your advice.

I will be online until tonight at 11:30PM EST to answer any questions regarding the experience. I am currently in a fed state.\n\n(Added T+27:00) - For those wishing to get acquainted with HA-966, here is a excerpt from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HA-966):\n\n\"HA-966 or (\u00b1) 3-Amino-1-hydroxy-pyrrolidin-2-one is a molecule used in scientific research as a glycine receptor and NMDA receptor antagonist / low efficacy partial agonist. It has neuroprotective and anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, antinociceptive and sedative / hypnotic effects in animal models. Pilot human clinical trials in the early 1960s showed that HA-966 appeared to benefit patients with tremors of extrapyramidal origin.\n\nThe two enantiomers of HA-966 have differing pharmacological activity. The glycine/N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist activity is specific to the R-(+) enantiomer, whereas the sedative and ataxic effects are specific to the S-(-) enantiomer.\n\nR-(+)-HA-966 did not induce drug-appropriate responding in animals trained to discriminate phencyclidine (PCP) from saline, suggesting that the glycine receptor ligand R-(+)-HA-966 has a significantly different behavioral profile than drugs affecting the ion channel of the NMDA receptor complex.\n\nS-(\u2212)-HA-966 has been described as a \"\u03b3-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB)-like agent\" and a \"potent y-butyrolactone-like sedative\" but it shows no affinity for the GABAB receptor (GABABR).\"\n\n---Start of report---\n\n6:30PM (T+0:00) - Sublingually dosed 100mg HA-966 HCl. The taste is somewhere between table salt, baking soda, and plastic. definitely not pleasant but not prohibitively bad.\n\nT+10:00 - Swallowed what was left of the powder and drank a glass of water. I believe I may feel a slight reduction in anxiety as well as some initial disorientation, however not enough to distinguish from placebo just yet\n\nT+37:00 - Definitely feeling it now. Certainly feeling dissociated but not in a dreamlike/euphoric way like with opiates or alcohol. It almost feels like I'm a bit anesthetized. Extreme reduction in pain sensation, unsteady gait, feeling somewhat mentally/physically dampened, and my peripheral vision has become incredibly dark and blurry. I can only read something when I'm looking directly at it. So far it is incredibly unique. I have never tried ketamine or GHB, however I have trialed many gabapentinoids, research benzos/thienos as well as DXM/N2O many years ago. As some researchers have stated before me, despite it being so sedating/anesthetizing it feels incredibly \"clean\". So far no dysphoria to speak of. I am considering taking another 50mg dose just to see what this chem can do, will keep you all updated.\n\nT+55:00 - Sublingually dosed an additional 50mg HA-966 HCl. My total dose is now 150mg. Awful taste is most certainly still there.\n\nT+1:30:00 - Second dose is now kicked in. Feeling heavily sedated. If I close my eyes for too long I could easily fall asleep. This now feels remarkably similar to alcohol physically, however mentally there is much less disinhibition/euphoria. My mind almost feels \"cleared\" similar to antipsychotics and it's hard for me to focus on one thing for too long. the anesthetic analogy used previously remains very true\n\nT+2:24:00 - In what may prove to be a foolish idea, I decided to sublingually dose the final 100mg in the first of my two .25g samples of HA-966. My total dose for the night is now 250mg. Despite the seeming lack of euphoria that this chemical provides, there seems to be quite the compulsion to redose. I really hope I didn't overdo this last dose and can continue to stay up and report on this substance's effects because so far this is proving to be a refreshingly novel chemical. Will update\n\nT+3:07:00 - Physical impairment is now severe, mental impairment however is relatively low. Can still think fairly clearly, however acting on anything is difficult. I want to get dinner but driving is absolutely out of the question. I may walk to a local Indian place and get some chicken curry. It\u2019s only a quarter mile away but the walk seems quite daunting in my current state. Right there is a notable difference from alcohol/benzos. Unlike benzos I\u2019m very aware that I\u2019m pretty messed up and unlike alcohol I don\u2019t have the \u201cfuck it\u201d attitude that makes long treks through the snow and cold more bearable.\n\nT+4:00:00 - Couldn't muster the strength to brave the midwestern (I'm in the US) wind and cold on the walk to the restaurant. Decided to compromise and make some red beans and rice at my apartment. Roommate (who's also into RCs) came home and noticed I was having a hard time walking from the pantry to the stove. I told him I was on a quite hefty dose of HA-966 and he laughed and decided to drop a 6mg dose of 3-HO-PCP to join in on the NMDA antagonizing fun. We may smoke a bowl here soon before eating, however climbing the fire escape in this weather does not sound enticing in the slightest. I'll keep y'all updated. Also Jack says hi!\n\nT+4:25:00 - Just updating to let you guys know the 11:30PM deadline is scrapped. I'm going to be online now until I go to sleep, which will probably be later tonight.\n\nT+6:00:00 - Smoked a couple bowls with roommate, HA-966 definitely has distinct effects when combined with THC. Incredibly euphoric and sedating high. Not sure what mechanism would be responsible for this though. Roommate left to eat some of that rice \ud83d\udc4d listening to music now and it sounds fantastic. If any of my fellow researchers are in the market for a new pair of headphones I highly recommend the Sony MDR-XB950B1 \ud83d\ude01 anyways I\u2019m exhausted y\u2019all, I\u2019ll do a follow-up post sometime tomorrow but for now I\u2019m signing off.

I personally don't think it is a good RC, but I'll wait other reports and informations, since there's little material about it online. I already tried it two times (no meds or anything, I was sober). The first one was in my hometown, with two friends and my gf: we dosed 40mg outside in a field, we didn't really know about the ETERNAL comeup time and waited two hours. Nothing happened, so we went back to my house and dosed another 40mg oral, for a grand total of 80mg, which, while certainly intense, was quite manageable for me. After three hours and a half we could feel the first effects. Apparently the comeup time ranges from two hours (with stomach completely empty) to five(!). The only thing you can feel are these constant goosebumps on the head, which are quite pleasuring. Then the effects start to ramp up very slowly and will continue for about ten/twelve hours. So yeah, the thing is a whopping 16 hours affair. Yuck! Since we were in my house I felt very chill. BOHB is very sedating, we ended up completely couchlocked for hours on end, watching stupid stuff online and laughing, with mild visuals and a surreal feel. It was fun but nothing profound or intresting about it, I felt like jumping from one video to the next was the only thing keeping me in check, didn't really feel like doing anything else.The main problem was the vasoconstriction that came with it. We turned up the heating to 23 degrees and still felt cold, and we even had jackets inside, but I was also sweating a lot from my hands and feet. It's really, really extreme.The interaction with weed was very good, every joint I smoked enhanced this opiate-like sedating feel were I felt like a funny squishy laughing blob on the couch.\n\nThe \"disaster\" arrived at my second try with it, this time in a completely different setting. I was with my girlfriend and we traveled across our country to another city to attend a psytrance party, so being far from home and a little bit underslept may have contributed. A friend of ours hosted us the first night, then next morning he went away but left us his home to crash after the party, which was still quite far from there. I thought since it was structurally similar to 2CB, BOHB would be a good party drug. Boy was I wrong! I dropped 60mg oral around 8pm, with the party beginning in three hours. After one hour or so, the usual head chills had started. At around 10pm my gf dropped her 60mg dose. At 11pm we were in, with the effects slowly coming up for me. Then the first waves of nausea arrived. It was one of the worst bodyloads I've ever experienced in my life, so unpleasuring I was questioning my choices for the night. Knowing that my girlfriend is a bit more paranoid than me, I started praying it would not hit her the same when it came up, but it did. We were both extremely nauseated and continuously visiting the (dirty) bathrooms to puke and try to sh\\*t. At that point, I really preferred to be sober. I was sweating a lot with almost contrasting sensations of heat and cold (it was a hot night so the vasoconstriction was less extreme, thank god) Waves of alternating discomfort and pleasure were hitting me but overall It was the worst party drug imaginable: didn't feel like dancing at all, I had to really concentrate to try and have fun and combat the uneasiness. At some point I was laughing from how unfortunate the whole situation was: we were really hyped about the party, then this stupid rc ruined the night. Then a fight broke out, and someone called the cops. At some point I started talking to people and felt a mild empathogen effect, but I could only tell them that I wasnt feeling very good. Music was also a bit enhanced, MDMA-like, but without the pleasure of dancing. Meanwhile my girlfriend wore a sweater and felt quite cold, with bad circulation on her hands and continuously had to go to the bathroom and drink due to vasoconstriction. I almost puked an apple, the only thing I ate after dinner. Then she napped a bit on a chair but described it as very much non-intended, a \"black out\" of sorts. At about 3 or 4am I was sitting on a chair wishing to be outside the party. Then it started to rain. Then a second fight broke out and two people fell on my girlfriend while fighting  and shouting like crazy and she got really scared. We decided to leave. Sun was already coming up and we slowly came back to the city until we arrived at our friend's house at about 7:30. On the way back I started to feel a bit of relief and some deep thoughts, but I also felt quite guilty of how I pushed doing the drug and ruining the night for the two of us. We crashed on the bed but I felt so useless and hollow... I couldn't sleep at all, and a really bad anxiety creeped in. I was thinking of every possible way I had to calm myself down, but I didn't have any meds or anything, only some L-tryptophan and magnesium, which fortunately worked a bit. I completely crashed in a dreamless sleep for about two or three hours, then I woke up, destroyed by the lack of sleep. I still had no appetite at all, but I tried my hardest to eat a little lunch. I still felt like shit, and I had to catch a bus to return home. On the bus, I finally felt relaxed and slept, but man, was it a bad experience.

My only experience I can size up any RC disso to is my numerous LSD and mushroom trips. I did try K at a bar one time years ago but that was just a bump and all I can remember is being wobbly and fuzzy. I do remember it being fun, though.\n\nNow, the real kicker. I have dove deep into the psychedelic universe. I have gone so far that sometimes I think it's too far. It got to a point that I forgot everything on a ten strip trip. My friends told me I was running around naked. I never want to be out of control like that again. To top it off, the parts of the trip I could remember was beyond nightmarish. I was convinced that I was dead and was in hell. \n\nDespite a few bad trips and this massively terrifying trip, I want to dip my toes back into the world of psychs but am a little nervous on where to start or to start at all. \n\nMy top two choices are 1cP-LSD or 2f-DCK. My concern with the lysergamide is obvious as I don't want to feel anything remotely close to what I did before. It's been a few years since I tripped. If I was to go the lysergamide route I would have a benzo on hand that I'd most likely take a little before and possibly during if I get cold feet. I pretty much know what to expect, but at the same time have zero confidence that I do because of what happened before. It's a strange feeling. It's like going back to your home town saying \"I don't need a map\" and then you find out the the entire place has been gentrified and you don't recognize any of the streets. \n\nFor 2f-DCK my main concerns are mania and addiction. The mania/paranoia scares me the most as I have once been in serious amphetamine psychosis for 48 hours. I was hearing, seeing, and feeling things. If dissos resemble stimulant psychosis or mania in any way, I don't want it. \n\nWhat confuses me most about dissos is the wide range of effects. You get sedation, stimulation, dissociated, and more social all in one drug. My first thought is \"oh, like acid!\". I'm really trying to comprehend this class of drugs. It seems to be mentioned along side many depressants like benzos and opiates. I see a lot of cross use between benzo addicts. As a benzo addict my self, my ears perked up. Pain relief and relaxation in a drug that can help depression? Sounds like my cup of tea. \n\nPlease, someone try your best to clarify for me in the best way you can. I know asking someone to explain a drug experience is next to impossible. For me, this is extremely important because I don't want to make a decision that causes lasting trauma or damage to me.

A quick search here on Reddit will render hundreds of posts discouraging use and telling tales of the horrid withdrawal but after reading so much about it I had to try it out for myself and to be completely honest I am pretty amazed. \n\nDOSE: 150mg of Tianeptine sodium Orally, dissolved in water (no opioid tolerance) \n\nNOTE: Tianeptine tastes horrendous, possibly the most bitter thing I have ever consumed \n\n\\--REPORT--\n\n0:10 - Feel a slight relaxation hitting me, placebo? Not sure at this point.\n\n0:15 - Suddenly feel a strong opioid effect coming over me, I'm begging to zone out looking at my screen and a strong sensation of warmth is spreading from head to toe.\n\n0:30 - Wow the rush was incredible, I have gone from completely sober to extremely high within the span of only about 20 minutes, I feel a strong \"stoned\" sensation in my head and have all of the classic opioid effects that one would expect from a strong opiate narcotic like oxycodone or hydrocodone (If not even stronger looking back). However the sedation aspect isn't quite there, I do feel spaced out and heavy-eyed, however I have been unable to catch a nod thus far.\n\n1:00 - After my previous entry I got in bed for the next half hour. Although still feel extremely \"opiate high\" and have now nodded off a few times the Euphoria is begging to fade. \n\n1:30 - Effects are still very strong and subtle itching is begging to set in. Although I feel incredibly sedated and disconnected from my body I haven't been able to nod as much as I normally would off other classic opiates. My body almost feels as if its sinking into my bed, really nice actually.\n\n2:00 - I'm begging to return to baseline. Although I still feel some pretty decent opioid effects I'm definitely past the peak and am actually starting to nod a little harder then before, possibly because the other non-opioid aspects of the drug are wearing off? The euphoria is pretty much gone however yet physically, I still feel amazing. \n\n3:30 - The effects are almost gone now. I still have a lingering opioid sensation through out my body but I am no longer nodding and mentally I feel very tired and still slightly spacey but almost baseline other then that.\n\n5:00 Effects are totally gone, although I barely still feel a slight comfort through out my body, mentally I am completely sober and ready to go to sleep.\n\nConclusion: \n\nWow for a legal RC this is amazing. Its by far the best legal opioid I have ever tried and kicks kratom's ass if you want a classic full agonist high. Its definitely not as \"clean\" feeling as morphine/fentanyl derived opiates but its damn close. For me It felt like a mix between tramadol and oxycodone, leaning far more towards oxy if not being even stronger in some aspects. Although the peak and overall duration is short It has an incredible rush and feels no different then a strong narcotic I would expect to be given by a doctor. \n\nHowever despite my praise this drug is not all good, as I'm sure many of you know it has awful withdrawals and due to its short duration is incredibly fiendish. This is mostly because although the bodily opiate effects linger about as long as oxycodone the euphoria fades rapidly within less then 2 hours and possibly shorter as tolerance builds. \n\nIn conclusion tianeptine sodium provides a slightly dirtier and shorter but arguably stronger oxycodone like high. It feels no different from a classic opioid and I believe the potential for abuse is no less. If you can see yourself having problems with opiate use or have been dependent in the past stay far away from this drug because although the high is good it will smash all classic opioids in terms of withdrawal and tolerance.

Since it's a tricyclic anti depressant it works on multiple systems, only one of which is the mu opioid receptors. Normal prescribed doses are 12.5 mg 3x daily, so recreational doses are roughly 10 times a singular dose. The issue with that is that a lot of the other mechanisms (serotonin reuptake enhancement, glutamatergic system downregulation) do not scale in the same way as the opioid effects.\n\nThis means that to get the desired opioid effects, people have to take massive doses that end up raising tolerance/activating other pathways really quickly and aggressively. This means that while normal withdrawal from opiates can be uncomfortable, withdrawal from tianeptine is like withdrawing from an opiate, an antidepressant, and a benzodiazepine/tranquilizer all at the same time, and after a shorter period of use than a typical opioid. It would be especially strong because of the doses being 10x+ the therapeutic effect as well, meaning someone unlucky enough to kick a tianeptine habit will be in for:\n\nrunny nose, achy bones, no energy, hot/cold flashes, stomach cramps/explosive diarrhea, increased pain sensitivity, extreme restless leg syndrome, extreme feelings of sadness/depression/hopelessness, akathisia, extreme anxiety.\n\nPeople should be able to choose what they do/put in their bodies, as long as it doesn't harm others.

Pretty much everything beyond that are more or less well educated guesses.\n\nAfter some doing some Research I would estimate that there are not more 25 publicized scientific texts that even mention  3-HO-PCP.  Even it is only one RC out of many and has only been used as a drug 10 years or so. I think it is insane that there are still  more research-papers about the [Bokikokiko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokikokiko), a species of warblers (birds) only found on the pacific island Kiritimati. This extends to RC in general, the gap between research (\\~[17.300 search-results on google scholar](https://scholar.google.de/scholar?start=30&q=%22Novel+psychoactive+substances%22+OR+%22designer+drugs%22&hl=de&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=2000&as_yhi=2019) since 2010) and need (estimated numbers of RC-Users 1-3% in western countrys) is huge and in the end the missing knowledge does unfathomable amount of harm to people. Everybody agrees with that, no matter whether you ask politicians, scientist, cops or this sub.\n\nBut oh well. I had advertised all since knows, here it is.\n\nGenerally you can divide the literature in two categories: There are maybe  [\\~15 old publications from 81-99](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=search&cmd_current=Limits&term=3-Hydroxyphencyclidine+OR+79787-43-2+%5Brn%5D) and  then  [\\~10  more, which were written since the beginnign of  the RC-era](https://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=de&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=%223-HO-PCP%22&btnG=), the first one dating to 2014.\n\nThe earlier publications are oldschool pharmaceutics stuff: \"If we would put just few more atoms on this molecule it here or there, it might get better..\" And then they build the molecules and  tested them in almost every organ a rat has to offer. After PCP was normally  \"discovered\"  (created by accident) in 1956 they researched it hard. They had a few misses but '62 they tried ketamine and found it was much better than PCP - great job! '78 they tried 3-HO-PCP and found it was much more opiate than PCP - great job! [Here is a really cool chart depicting the timeline of dissociatives](http://i.imgur.com/7YCfGLt.png).\n\nThe new publications created in wake of the RC-boom\n\nThere are a few relatively recent papers where 3-HO-PCP is mentioned in context of NPS/RC in general. These can be seen als scientific summarys, which try to collect what we know, but  add no real new data, at least not on 3-ho-pcp. One these papers worth mentioning  is \"[The Bridge Between Classical and \u201cSynthetic\u201d](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336956121_The_Bridge_Between_Classical_and_SyntheticChemical_Psychoses_Towards_a_Clinical_Psychopathological_and_Therapeutic_Perspective) \\- [Chemical Psychoses: Towards a Clinical, Psychopathological, and Therapeutic Perspective](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336956121_The_Bridge_Between_Classical_and_SyntheticChemical_Psychoses_Towards_a_Clinical_Psychopathological_and_Therapeutic_Perspective)\" from 11/2019. It is what is called meta-study, which try to find, organize and analyze already given data. In this case with the researchers wanted to get a better understanding of  possible links between the use of RCs and psychosis. Nothing on 3-HO, but these synthetic cannabinoids seem to be kind of dangerous..\n\nThen there are a few papers on the group of arylcyclohexamines. They are mentioning 3-HO-PCP of course - more or less often - but also do not add any new data. One of the most interesting papers might be \"[From PCP to MXE: a comprehensive review of the non-medical use of dissociative drugs](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/dta.1620)\" by Morris & Wallach. It tries to give a most comprehensive overview over the chemical class. From this paper I have taken a lot of information to write the history-parts of this post.\n\nAnd then there  is one single paper which is explicitly about the harm-potential of 3-HO-PCP in humans: \"[ Severe Toxicity to the New Psychoactive Substances 3-Hydroxyphencyclidine and N-Ethylhexedrone: an Analytically Confirmed Case Report](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13181-019-00734-x)\"\n\nThe case is of a 56-year-old male who was brought to the Emergency Department after \"his neighbours called the emergency services due to their concern about \u2018noises\u2019 coming from his home. He was found by the ambulance crew when they arrived to be drowsy, diaphoretic and pale, and was reported to be \u2018hot to touch\u2019.\"  In the hospital they diagnosed \"hyperthermia (39.9 \u00b0C \\[103,82F\u00b0\\]), sinus tachycardia (150 beats per minute), reduced consciousness, ocular clonus, and vertical nystagmus \\[twitching of the eye\\]. All dangerous and very unpleasant.\n\nAfter some benzos and  a little bit of time he was going better (and later fully recovered).  Then he told  that he had tried to weigh out 10mg ho-pcp but \"this was difficult with the weighing equipment he had available\". Also he did hexen the night before and some cough syrup.  So this, again, isn't really bringing us new information. This is how the author puts it:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>This single case report is the first documented toxicity to the drug 3-hydroxyphencylidine or N-ethylhexedrone in the medical literature. However, in case reports \\[...\\] there are a number of confounding factors that should be acknowledged as seen in this case, where the individual uses more than one recreational drug and/or NPS that could contribute to the clinical symptoms and signs reported. However, it is possible for an experienced medical toxicologist to use the self-reported drug or NPS used alongside the analytical data and the clinical symptoms and signs to determine which drug/NPS is most likely to be responsible for the acute toxicity described.  \n>  \n>A limitation with the case presented here is our presumed understanding of the dose consumed by the patient. As discussed, reports on Erowid have described 25-mg doses to give positive effects. The patient stated an aim to consume 10 mg of 3-HO-PCP but may have inadvertently taken a massive dose. If he did take the intended dose, this may have been due to purity or individual sensitivity. Further study looking at quantitative analysis and analysis of the drug itself may help to understand this issue.\n\nOr in short: We fucking know nothing about 3-ho-pcp.", "author": "bk-2cb", "score": 37, "flair": null, "created": 1576965647.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/edq7yj/ive_read_every_scientific_source_on_3hopcp_here/", "num_comments": 16, "title": "I've read every scientific source on 3-HO-PCP.

(I know I\u2019m a bit young and such, but I practice strict harm reduction) \n\nMy other experiences include:\n*Stims:*\nSpeed, coke, MDMA, methylphenidate (ritalin)\n\n*Psychedelics/hallucinogens:*\nLSD, mushrooms, ketamine, 4-HO-MET, 4-HO-MiPT, 2C-B, salvia\n\n*Opiates/benzodiazepines:*\nEtizolam, kratom\n\n*Others:*\nWeed, alcohol, nitrous\n\nT: 00:00\nI took 60mg orally mixed with a shot of water, this should be just enough for a stimulating couple hours, see [psychonautwiki](https://m.psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FA) for more info about the dose range. It tasted just like regular amphetamine (speed).\n\nT: 00:30\nI don\u2019t feel much, I decided to go for a run, so I put on my headphones and play some nice early eurodance. \n\nT: 01:30 I get home after I finish my 7 km run. I don\u2019t usually run this much, my usual routine is 4 km, but I felt really motivated during the run to extend it for a bit. During the run, the music sounded quite a lot better than normally, and I felt _very_ motivated to keep running, but _not_ forced to move, as I do feel with speed, or MDMA. It was a pleasurable sensation, because I was very clearheaded, and I felt very confident that I had pretty good stamina.\n\nT: 2:00 \nAfter I got home, I drank a protein smoothie which I prepared earlier, to provide my body with the needed calories and vitamins. I felt overall very calm and clearheaded, as I mostly do after my morning run, but this time I felt it more consciously. \n\nT: 3:00\nI decided to clean up my room, as I still felt the need to do _something_, even though I didn\u2019t feel any forced stimulation. After cleaning my room, I took a shower, and enjoyed the hot water tingling my body.\n\nT: 3:30\nAfter a long shower, I hopped onto the playstation, and played some rocket league. I felt I was coming down, although even the comedown was pleasurable and calm, very unlike other substances. I didn\u2019t feel the urge to redose, and was glad that I enjoyed the substance for how long it lasted.\n\nT: 4:30\nI am now fully sober (I _feel_ fully sober, this doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not under the influence, so always wait at least a day after using any substance with things such as driving etc. I can\u2019t stress this enough!) The comedown was very gradual, and I was just as sober as before, I didn\u2019t feel depressed or anything, like I do with many other stims. I also didn\u2019t experience any muscle contractions or jaw clenching during the whole experience.\n\nT: 1 day after\nI slept well, nothing remarkable honestly, and I feel overall pretty good.\n\nConclusion:\nVery clean and clearheaded substance, I can imagine it makes for a good evening on the dance floor, (7/10) for the feeling, only downside is short duration.\nAlso very suitable for a study drug, or a \u201cclean up your house\u201d kind of drug, as I like to call it.

Effects come on about 30 mins after ingestion and then starts to taper off around an hour or so after but still have a nice glow for 2-3 hours.\n\nIt would be nice if it had longer legs, I have been reading a new compound called AP 238 lasts a bit longer but has a little different high - has anyone tried this yet?\n\nI have had no issues with my stomach or anything like I have read about. Mine doesn't smell like gasoline but I guess would have the cheese smell as others have mentioned.\n\nAnyways I have been pleasantly surprised with this compound and look forward to further testing.

Dissociatives are the one class of chems that sadly I have limited experience with, N2O, DXM and HA-966 are really the only dissos I've had my hands on, and those are all fairly weak (save for high dose N2O).\n\nTo answer your question regarding purity, overarchingly yes, stimulants are generally found to be cut heavier than other chems (opiate RCs are a solid second place though). However this mostly depends on how good your vendor is. Try to stick to the more common stims (your FMAs, FPMs, etc) and stay the hell away from the shitty-ass piperazine derivatives (I'm looking at you kleferein). If you *really* want to be safe, you could acetone wash your powder and do a recrystallization.
