# Opioid-Use Knowledge Graph Project Template

This repository contains initial code for building a knowledge graph for opioid use in the States. 
The code takes in post from Reddit that including key word about drugs, and generate an association graph for every drug related terms mentioned in the post.
The data.py takes care of input data. analysis.py make a small process on data to make content that can be processed to build graph.
The model.py use lsh search for drug-related terms that mentioned in the post, and build an association graph for terms that appear in the post.

The code can be excuted by 
    - python run.py data 
    - python run.py data analysis
    - python run.py graph

Target explainnation 
    1: dataï¼š read in, reddit, and key_term data. And process them into format (e.g.break down sentences into words and put into a dictionary) that can be used for following analysis steps.
    2: analysis:  process reddit data with LSH and word2vec to extract key phrases, and print out the similarity socre for each matched phrases in the reddit data.
    3: model: use lsh model to create nodes and edges, and put into one knowledge graph. require output from first two target to run
