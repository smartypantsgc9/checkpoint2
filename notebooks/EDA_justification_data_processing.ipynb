       "'Greetings to everybody. My background I want share. Firstly, this post is not to promote drugs, this post is to teach teenagers that are about to use drugs, and tell them the consequences, the downs, the depression, the brain damages, and all negativities.Because we adults definetly know that telling dont do is not gonna do anything :) So better guide for safety no one gets harmed.\\n\\nWhat things Below that I have used for long term what I call (1-6 months)\\n\\n1) Weed (3 years, every morning, every lunchtime, every afternoon , every night ; basically till I pass out peacefully, what I call dying :) )\\n\\n2) LSD( I did this 3 times, first one was Microdosing 25ug done for 2 weeks, second one for spirituality purposes which really scared me but no traumas thanks God that was extreme dosage 600ug, third time was more conscious and not crazy which was 250ug and that was a lovely experience walked outside slowly with Hiphop on my ear to cancel bad trips and stick to lyrics singing watching the sun rising, sittin on grass meditating with Theta Waves Sounds in my ear.)\\n\\n3) Mushrooms( Many many times, just for fun no spirtuality. I wish I done for spirituality after I made some research Mushrooms and meditating is real good one trust me. I tried the Chocolate ones, mushroom as itself ones original, and one time I did Mushroom which was the first time I tried I was a bit coward :) So I drank whiskey with it and it was really enjoyable but I ended up doing barfix with my friends outside at 3 AM injured my hand then I was saying funny things like “Damn Im a Army Veteran, be a Soldier , bring me some whiskey we pour the this wound so bacterias die” I was damn crazy, actually Im still crazy and fun for many people ahahah)\\n\\n4) Ketamine (I hated it, why the hell I would try that man. I dont like things that makes me dumb, slow thinking, slow response. But Im hyprocrite check out the 5th step and you get me)\\n\\n5)Codeine with Promethazine( My favorite, I got addicted to this one, I dont recommend to any of you guys, oxycodone too . Dont do it stay away! The withdrawals of it!?? Oh - My- Dear- Lord. Whole body hurts 24/7, when you lie down to bed it still hurts, you cant go to sleep, I even couldnt sleep with weed when I quit codeine , the weed was like not effecting at all, it was weird, and trust me I only get the A+ stuff, but overall I loved Codeine, calming down, but dangerous sometimes because if you miss the dose and keep goin your heart stops , its slows you that much.)\\n\\n6) lyrica(pregabalin 300mg) my favorite in the whole drugs industry. I was a extreme alhocolic. I would wake up at 4 AM, and start drinking at 12:00 lunchtime starting with 2 double whiskies, then go lunch and have some Wine, dont even ask the rest of the day, 70cl Whiskey mostly half of it, Weed included, sometimes xanax included. Real blackout. Why I tell this? Because Lyrica is the drug that make me quit Alcohol. Basically it makes me calm,chill, talkative, motivated, uplifted, energetic, alway'"
